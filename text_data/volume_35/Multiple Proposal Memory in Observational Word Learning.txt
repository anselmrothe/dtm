   According to the weaker propose-but-verify account, a fi-
nal test with the 100% referent absent will trigger considera-
tion of all past proposed meanings. This means that above-
chance performance on the 50% referent is expected if and
only if the learner had previously selected (clicked on) a
50% referent during the learning phase. One might expect
such a memory to have a recency component: More recently
proposed meanings will be easier to remember. Moreover,
early encounters of a string of 50% referents (i.e., PPPAAA)
will increase the probability that this referent will be se-
lected during the learning phase and thus more likely to be
recalled at test. Conversely, it is very unlikely during learn-

whereas Condition was not (χ2(3) = 3.45, p = .33) and both

   Similar to Experiment 1, having looked at the 100% ref-

this pattern: The 50% referent was still chosen significantly
more often than chance as long as it was also looked at most
at least once (t(31) = 3.80, p < .001).
   These results suggest that learners’ behavior when
choices were not forced during learning was similar to their
behavior when they were forced to respond (i.e., as in Ex-
periment 1). While it may be less crucial that the 50% refer-
ent was paid particular attention to exactly the last time it
was encountered, the data indicates that it is was necessary
that it at some point in learning it had been attended to.
While this difference could suggest that memory in Experi-                  Figure 5: 50% referent selections in test, Exp. 1 & 2
