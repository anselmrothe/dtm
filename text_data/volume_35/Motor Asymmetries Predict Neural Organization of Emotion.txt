We find that positive emotions are strongly modulated by in-         spheric lateralization for emotion covaries with manual motor
duced frontal activation asymmetries, whereas negative emo-          asymmetries, consistent with a causal relationship between
tions are unaffected. If negative emotions are assumed to be         motivation and motor control. The SSH proposes a principle
the mirror image of positive emotions, this result seems in-         by which the hemispheres become specialized for approach
congruous. This apparent contradiction resolves when exam-           and avoidance states, and may lead not only to a better un-

and negative PANAS subscales.                                        cortex, but also of why it is organized that way.
