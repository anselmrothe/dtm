The degree of fatigue and the extent of recovery are
expected to also influence the duration for which the effects
are sustained.
   In addition, the duration of the presentation of the object
to be estimated warrants some discussion. In this study, the
stimulus was presented for a limited duration of 5 s. The
subjective level could become dominant in processing when
the object of the estimation is presented for longer duration.
Moreover, many issues remain with regard to the mutual
relationship between the top-down processing of the
subjective view and the bottom-up processing from the
physical body.
   In the literature of the cognitive process of metaphor, it is
thought that metaphors enable us to think about concepts on
the basis of concrete sensorimotor experiences. Previous
