Accessibility of a particular social group, reflects a person’s
past experience with that group (Turner et al., 1994). Identi-
ties have higher or lower accessibility depending on how ac-
cessible is that specific categorization in a person’s memory.
Identities that have been used more times and displace more
emotional valence are more accessible.
   The accessibility from new social identities, as the ones
from ad-hoc social groups, is implied by the distance between
the agent values (< c1 , ..., cn >Ag ) and the centroid from its
in-group. As such, agents that are closer to the centroid have
higher accessibility while agents further from it have lower
accessibility, translating this way the connection strength be-
tween a agent and that ad-hoc social group (see equation 6).                        Figure 1: The Salience Calculation Pipeline.
