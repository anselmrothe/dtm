                               Abstract
   People’s representations of most and arguably all linguistic and
   non-linguistic categories are probabilistic. However, in lin-
   guistic theory, quantifier meanings have traditionally been de-
   fined set-theoretically in terms of categorical evaluation func-
   tions. In 4 “adaptation” experiments, we provide evidence for
   the alternative hypothesis that quantifiers are represented as
   probability distributions over scales (e.g., Zadeh, 1965). We
   manipulate exposure to different distributions of “some” and
   “many” and find that listeners adapt to those distributions, as
   predicted. Our results suggest that the interpretation of quanti-
   fiers is best modeled as a process involving rich, probabilistic
   representations.
