Figure 1: Panels A (gains) and B (losses) plot the weighting functions obtained when fitting cumulative prospect theory
to the choices of the priority heuristic in gambles where the decision was made on the minimum gain (loss) in 75%,
50%, or 25%, respectively, and on the probability of the minimum gain (loss) otherwise. Panel C shows the parameter
profiles of CPT’s value and weighting function parameters fitted to the choices of the priority heuristic in the three
gamble sets (as the parameters differed in their scale, they were normalized for this graph; for the exact parameter
values, see Table 1).
