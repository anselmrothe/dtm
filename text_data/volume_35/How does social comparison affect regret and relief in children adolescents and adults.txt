            Experiment 1 – Private context
Aims and Hypotheses. Thus, the aim of the first
experiment was to uncover the development of regret and
relief in late childhood, adolescence and adulthood.
  In order to do so, participants performed a child friendly
gambling task adapted from Camille et al. (2004). We asked
participants to choose between two wheels of fortune that
differed in the amount of gain and loss expected and the
probability of winning. We manipulated the outcome of the
wheel of fortune that was not selected by the participants to
induce either regret or relief. For each trial, participants
rated how they felt about the outcome and their willingness
to modify their choice, on a classical likert-type scale.
  As the OFC has a fundamental role in the experience of
regret, and given the late maturation of this brain area, we
expect to observe a progressive development of the
