participants’ hands were crossed (the participant sitting on
the left pressed the right key with his/her left hand; the
participant sitting on the right pressed the left key with
his/her right hand).Viewing distance was about 60 cm.
Procedure The experiment consisted of two consecutive
sessions: a practice session and a transfer session.
Participants first performed a joint spatial compatibility task
(practice session) with an incompatible mapping (stimulus
positions were mapped incompatibly to response-key
positions, that is participants were required to respond to the
controlateral stimulus with respect to the response-key
position). Each participant was instructed to respond to only
one of the two stimulus locations by pressing the
contralateral key (by crossing their arms) and refraining
from responding when a stimulus appeared in the alternative
position. Hence, half of the participants responded to left
stimuli by pressing a right key, whereas the other half
responded to right stimuli by pressing a left key (see Fig. 1).
After a 5-min rest, participants were administered a joint
Simon task (transfer session), in which the red and green
stimuli were always location-irrelevant trials. Participants            Figure 1: Schematic representation of the experimental
