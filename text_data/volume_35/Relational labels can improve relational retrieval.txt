experiment. In the test phase, participants received the set of
stories that they did not receive during the encoding phase.
For each story, they were asked to write down any of the
original stories of which they were reminded. They were
told that they could write down multiple original stories if
they were reminded of them by one test story. Likewise,
they could write down an original story multiple times if
they were reminded of it by multiple test stories.
   The test stories were presented one at a time on the
screen, with a large text box below each story for
participants to write down their responses. Participants were
allowed as much time as needed to make their responses. As
in the encoding phase, in the two labeling conditions (labels
at test, labels at encoding and test), each of the stories ended
with a sentence describing the relational pattern.
   For each participant, we calculated two measures: the
number of relational matches retrieved and the number of
domain matches retrieved. A trained research assistant, who
was blind to condition, coded the responses as relational                  Figure 1: The average number of relational matches
