are generated in the absence of any connector.                        (1)      Marc denkt über einen kleinen [Snack nach. Er

sives establish the same type of relation, but are different in
polarity (Louwerse, 2001; Sanders et al., 1992).
   A delay of processing concessives on the one hand and
defining concessives as negative causals on the other hand
seems to be in line with a frequently supported theory of
negation processing: Many experiments point to an account
where there is a general delay in processing negation (e.g.,
Carpenter & Just, 1975).
   Kaup et al. (2006), for instance, found in a self-paced read-
ing study combined with a picture naming task that when pro-
cessing contradictory predicates (e.g., The door is not open /
closed), ,                                                                    Figure 1: Stimulus for visual world experiment.
