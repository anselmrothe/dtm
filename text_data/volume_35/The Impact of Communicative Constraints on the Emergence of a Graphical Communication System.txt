was replicated in the present study. However, the game was
re-written to take into account new technological develop-
ments to ensure maximal compatibility with current browsers.
We chose a specific domain of objects for squiggles to make
“reference” to: human faces. While the previous study used a
non-standardized set of pictures, all pictures were now taken
from the Face Database (Minear & Park, 2004). This had
the advantage that all picture used the same light conditions,
background, facial expressions and dimensions. Variability
on those parts was thus excluded. 120 pictures were chosen                         Figure 1: An example of a speaking trial.

Discussion
As predicted, squiggles varied in structure and appearance
depending on the image drawn. For females, participants fo-                                         (b) Head Form
cused on the hair form and length, which resulted in longer
squiggles for females than males. Players tended to encode
several, short features for younger females and fewer, but
longer, features for old females. The increased number of
strokes for young females can be explained by a preference
for drawing hair which required several strokes (cf. Fig. 5a).                                    (c) Age/Wrinkles
Both strategies performed with the same level of accuracy in
listening trials, which shows that each strategy chose the right
aspects to be encoded.
   Salient features of young males were often hair or head
form, and on average, squiggles contained more features for
males than for females. Old males were typically depicted
by focusing on wrinkles and mouth form, which resulted in                                             (d) Mouth
