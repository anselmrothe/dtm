in this part include the predictive validity of cues, speed-
accuracy tradeoffs, the bias-variance dilemma, assessing clas-
sification outcomes via contingency tables (hits and correct
rejections vs. false alarms and misses), as well as fundamen-
tal concepts of SDT (e.g., criterion shifts, bias c, the sensi-
tivity index d 0 , and the interpretation of ROC curves, Luan et
al., 2011). The question How can we make effective and effi-
cient classification decisions on the basis of limited and noisy
data? will set the stage for the practical exercises.
Hands-on sessions [2 × 45 min]: Two practical parts
will explore the consequences of specific cue and criterion
choices. By using interactive software tools participants will
acquire hands-on experience in constructing FFTs.

ticipants will be guided through a series of exercises using
