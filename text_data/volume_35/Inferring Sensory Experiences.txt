What is important for our discussion, is that Austin
seems to have established a feature of appearance-
statements which does not hold for all cases, and
that this criterion supports our intuition that we self-
ascribe experiences just in cases in which the
appearance is not open to public confirmation.
However, it is of course possible for a person to
ascribe a sensory state despite the reason for why
something appears to be different from the way it
really is, is dependent on external conditions of
perception; and surely, people can self-ascribe their
sensory states even though there is no reason to
doubt the veridicality of their experiences. Hence, a
