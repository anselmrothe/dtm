tion source for understanding language and for learning new
words. Children who can infer how new information relates
to the current topic may be able to accumulate knowledge
more accurately and more efficiently. Because of its accessi-
bility to young children in our study (and the possibility that
even younger children might use discourse position in a sim-
pler task), the use of discourse structure to help disambiguate
reference might be one of the array of learning mechanisms
that helps explain children’s rapid vocabulary growth. Using
topic coherence to make inferences about novel terms and in-
formation may allow children to access learning opportunities
that would otherwise be unavailable.
