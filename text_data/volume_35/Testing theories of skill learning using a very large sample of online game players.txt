hope the present study offers a method of addressing.
   Next we review an area where the approach adopted in this
paper affords particular traction for looking at how the history
of skill acquisition affects performance.
Exploration versus exploitation
The computational framework of reinforcement learning
(Sutton & Barto, 1998), outlines a fundamental trade off
in decision making: every decision forces us to choose be-
tween taking the action which we estimate will yield the best
long term consequence (highest ‘value’), or trying out an ac-
tion of unknown or less certain value. This is known as the
‘exploration—exploitation dilemma’. Every choice is an op-           Figure 1: Screenshot of the game Axon. Players control the

On average, scores are higher with each consecutive play for
up to 100 plays (Figure 2). At around 80 plays the levels
of variation between scores, combined with the drop off of
number of players reaching that number of attempts, begin to
be seen in the loss of the smooth curve and larger error bars.
