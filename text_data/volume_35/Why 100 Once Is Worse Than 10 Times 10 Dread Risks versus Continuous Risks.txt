people-years lost because of a dread risk is larger than the
number of people-years lost because of a continuous risk, in
particular when the event affects the younger age groups.
People-years correspond to the number of people who live 1
year in the population. Hence, by killing a large number of
children or young adults at once, dread risks not only
deprive the society of their contribution in subsequent years,
but they also remove the potential contribution of the
offspring the victims could have had if they had survived
longer.
   To illustrate this hypothesis, consider first a very
simplified example. Imagine a population of 40 people,
uniformly distributed across four age groups:
   Children and adolescents, aged 0—19 years: Pre-fertile
generation that may produce offspring in the future.
   Young adults, aged 20—39 years: Fertile generation that
currently produces offspring.
   Older adults, aged 40—59 years: Post-fertile generation.
   Elderly adults, aged 60—79 years: Post-fertile generation.
   Further assume that the population growth is constant and
that every year each young adult produces exactly one
offspring. This implies that the number of children at time
point i, ti, corresponds to the number of young adults at time               Figure 1: Development of the population size when no

We set the total population to 160 people. The individuals
were distributed equally across 80 years (i.e., there were 2
individuals for each age at t0) and across four age groups, as
in the illustrative example above. Between conditions, we
manipulated (a) whether a dread or a continuous risk
occurred, (b) the population growth rate, and (c) which age
group was hit by the risk. The risk simulated was either a
dread risk that immediately killed 50% of the population of
the age group hit, or a continuous risk that killed the same
total number of people in the same age group over a period
of 10 years. The population growth rate was manipulated by
setting the birth rate to either 0.05 (constant population),
0.075 (increasing population), or 0.025 (decreasing
population). All individuals would die naturally after their
79th year. The risk hit only children, only young adults,
only older adults, or only elderly adults.
  In total there were 24 scenarios. Each scenario was
simulated 500 times, and we calculated for every time point
the average population size within the simulations. We
analyzed each scenario by comparing the log difference in
cumulative people-years between the dread risk condition
and the continuous risk condition after 25, 50, 75 and 100
years.
Results
Figure 2 shows the results for the log difference in
cumulative people-years depending on the population
growth rate and the hit group after 25, 50, 75, and 100 years.
A zero value indicates no difference in cumulative people-
years between the dread risk and continuous risk; a negative
value indicates a higher loss in cumulative people-years in
the dread risk condition, and a positive value a higher loss in
the continuous risk condition.
