measure to assess which players’ roles led to higher profits.

   It turns out that mutual cooperation is the lowest (~8 %)
in the opponents condition. This result is consistent with the
assumption that the competition, distinctive for the money

participants’ behavior.
   Mutual cooperation is also relatively low in the control
condition – the condition with neutral description of the
players’ roles. The interesting result is again in the
hierarchy condition for which the hire mutual cooperation is
obtained (~31 %) but as discussed earlier it is partially due
to one pair of players which cooperated throughout the               Figure 6: Average payoff per sequence of 40 games for a
