for faces of all races except White (see Figure 1B)
                         Discussion
Our study shows several novel findings. First, we observed
semantic interference in proper name retrieval in blocked
cyclic naming. To our knowledge, this has not been reported
previously. Second, the basis of the interference was racial
grouping of the faces, extending previous reports of
semantic interference among taxonomic, thematic or ad hoc
associates to social categories instantiated by facial features.       B. Face Naming Errors
In this domain, the basis for interference in name retrieval is
quite slender, comprising modulation of the mapping from
face to name by the mere knowledge that the named
individuals belong to a distinct racial group. Third, the
effect was present for three “other race” groups, but was
absent for the “own race” of the white participants. This is
interesting both as a new manifestation of the own race bias
(i.e., a name retrieval bias), and as evidence that semantic
interference does not arise under all conditions. The set of
white faces could certainly be construed as a category in the
context of this experiment, and yet we observed no evidence
of interference. The error data even suggest that naming of
homogeneous white faces may have been facilitated.
   Previous researchers of semantic interference have taken
pains to show that the effect is not an artifact of visual
similarity (e.g., Damian et al., 2001). This concern also
