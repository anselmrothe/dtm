Method
Design
We used a 2x2 mixed factorial design with two levels of
state anxiety (anxiety and control) and two options for
complexity of the task (choosing between 2 answers vs.
choosing between 4 answers). The level of state anxiety was
varied between-subject by serial subtraction task, described
thoroughly in the procedure section below. The complexity
of the task was operationalized as the number of possible
alternatives for the answer and it was varied within-subject.
