Abstract
We show that social roles alter creativity assessments.
Specifically, the two main roles in the innovation process –
generator roles for producing new ideas and implementer
roles for selecting ideas to pursue – invoke different lay
theories about what is creative. Study 1 showed that
implementers rated a low novelty version of an idea as more
creative than a high novelty version, but generators did the
opposite. Study 2 showed that generators rated a low
usefulness idea as more creative than a high usefulness idea,
but implementers did the opposite. Thus, complementary
roles prompted competing perspectives. These findings
underscore a new challenge for the social distribution of
knowledge-intensive work.
Keywords: Social Roles; creativity; categories; lay theories.

Introduction
Editor’s response to Sylvia Plath: There certainly isn’t
enough genuine talent for us to take notice.
Editor’s response to Rudyard Kipling: I’m sorry Mr.
Kipling, but you just don’t know how to use the English
language.
Many creative ideas are rejected and not necessarily more
kindly than Plath’s and Kipling’s were. Thus, it is not
enough to produce creative ideas. For cultural and scientific
advancement, others need to recognize that the ideas are
creative. One longstanding view is de gustibus non est
disputandum—assessments are idiosyncratic. In contrast,
current creativity theory and research claims that
assessments are guided by domain knowledge. People
within a community develop lay theories surrounding the
category of creativity—causal and relational knowledge
about what counts as creative and what is a more and less
central member of the category. With expertise in the area
(Amabile, 1982; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988), or even just
moderate exposure to the area (Hennessey, Amabile, &
Mueller, 2010; Sawyer, 2012), individuals appear to
converge with others in their assessments of creativity.
However, given how complex the causal and relational

knowledge is that underpins judgments about creativity, we
suggest that individuals’ assessments of creativity are
guided by more than just their domain knowledge. We
suggest that they are also guided by their social roles.
We explore the possibility that the editors failed to
recognize Plath and Kipling’s creative ideas not because of
lack of knowledge or idiosyncratic taste but because of their
roles as editors. Specifically, we examine two key roles
studied by organizational psychologists examining
organizational innovation (Elsbach & Kramer, 2003; Klein
& Knight, 2005; Klein & Sorra, 1996): implementers, such
as a book editor, and idea generators, such as a book author.
We propose that adopting an implementer role leads to a
different view of what is creative than adopting a generator
role. The argument we make is parallel to one made about
roles and person perception: different roles can produce
different expectancies (Biddle, 1986), which then lead
individuals in those roles to form different assessments of
the same focal person (e.g., Winquist, Mohr, & Kenny,
1998). Accordingly, it is not just that expectancies can
highlight some aspects of the causal and relational structure
underpinning a complex category and so alter judgments
about that category, but also that those expectancies are
systematically tied to particular social roles.
Social roles could shape assessments of creativity by
shifting the lay or implicit theories (Paletz & Peng, 2008;
Sternberg, 1985) people use to evaluate ideas for creativity.
This would resolve a puzzle in the creativity literature,
which provides evidence of multiple, potentially conflicting
lay theories about creativity. While there is widespread
agreement that creative ideas combine novelty and
usefulness (George, 2007), one lay theory is that novelty is
the dominant characteristic in creativity assessments
(Amabile, Barsade, Mueller, & Staw, 2005), whereas
another lay theory highlights that usefulness is the essential
component of creativity assessments (Cooper, 2006). Which
concern, novelty or usefulness, is deemed most causally
central might be critical, as there is now evidence that
people’s assessments of novelty and usefulness are
negatively related (Rietzschel, Nijstad, & Stroebe, 2009).
One reason why is a lay theory that highly novel ideas are
not very useful, as they are likely to fail to solve problems

1038

on time and within budget (Elsbach et al., 2003), and to fail
in the marketplace (Fleming, 2001), rendering them less
creative (Mueller, Melwani, & Goncalo, 2012). Another
reason why is a lay theory within scientific communities
that high levels of usefulness can indicate that an idea is not
very novel, as usefulness indicates taking on a smaller
challenge and making a smaller change from current
practice (Drazin, Glynn, & Kazanjian, 1999). We suggest
that people’s social roles guide which lay theories they use,
and so which causal factor underlying their model of
creativity is central and shaping their creativity assessments.
We focus on two social roles that are fundamental to the
social division of labor in the innovation process, generator
and implementer roles (Elsbach et al., 2003). The
innovation literature notes that these roles are
complimentary, and their coordination is key to the process
of innovation (Krishnan & Ulrich, 2001): generators create
new ideas, products and processes that implementers then
assess, select and pursue. For example, scientists generate
articles that editors vet, entrepreneurs generate business
ideas that venture capitalists fund, and researchers generate
product ideas that managers implement.
The two roles generate different expectancies. Generator
roles include expectations around generating new ideas and
overcoming challenges to solve problems in novel ways
(Drazin et al., 1999). Hence, generator roles may activate
lay theories about novelty being key to creativity and about
highly useful ideas being less creative due to less
opportunity for overcoming novel challenges. Implementer
roles include expectations around maximizing efficiency by
meeting timelines as well as budgetary and resource
constraints (Drazin et al., 1999). Accordingly, implementer
roles may activate lay theories about creative ideas being
distinguished by usefulness and about highly novel ideas
being less creative due to challenges of implementation.
If these predictions hold, then it will provide support for
the importance of social roles and expectancies in assessing
creativity. Managers may want creativity, but as
implementers, they may adopt perspectives that lead them to
reject the ideas that creators find most compelling. Thus,
our account provides an explanation for the phenomenon of
managers saying they want creativity but nonetheless end up
rejecting creative ideas, a phenomenon that is widely noted
in the popular press (e.g., Bussey, 2012; Hindo, 2007) and
in the innovation research literature (DeFillippi, Grabher, &
Jones, 2007; Smith & Lewis, 2011; Staw, 1995). The
broader theoretical implication is that two complementary
roles, such as implementer and generator roles in the
innovation process, may bring with them complementary
knowledge, but they may also bring with them competing
causal models of the same categories that may thwart their
ability to coordinate, communicate, and perform together.

Experiment 1
This study examined how individuals in generator and
implementer roles assessed a high and a low novelty idea.

We expected generators to assess the high novelty idea as
more creative than the low novelty idea, because of their lay
theory that novelty is the distinguishing characteristic of
creative ideas. The key prediction though is that we
expected implementers to rate the high novelty idea as less
creative than the low novelty idea, because of a lay theory
that highly novel ideas are less useful and so less creative.
Critically, we examine these predictions about role effects
by ensuring there were no systematic differences in domain
knowledge (an effect that may otherwise accompany roles)
by randomly assigning people to roles (as classically done
in Anderson & Pichert, 1978, among other work).

Method
Participants and Design We recruited 176 people from
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (62% male, M = 28.41 years,
SD = 9.43). Participants averaged 8.09 (SD = 8.94) years of
work experience. Participants were randomly assigned to
one of four conditions of a 2 (role: generator, implementer)
X 2 (idea novelty: high, low) between-subjects design. Each
cell contained more than 34 cases.
Procedure and Materials In Part one, participants were
assigned to either a generator or an implementer role at a
“large innovative product development firm” that “develops
high performance outdoor gear.” Generators were
responsible for “generating new ideas, brainstorming
technologies, and developing products and processes.”
Implementers were responsible for “cost savings,
profitability, decreased time to market, meeting deadlines
and product functionality.” These descriptions were from
prior research outlining generator and implementer role
expectations (Drazin et al., 1999). Participants then wrote
about the “important things that help you perform this role.”
In a pilot study (N = 152), three coders (average coder-pair
agreement was 94%) rated whether participants described
resources for novelty (e.g., "good team to help bounce ideas
off of," "inspiring workspace") and for usefulness (e.g.,
"efficient staff," "computer with accounting programs").
Implementers (96%) mentioned usefulness more than
generators (36%, χ2 (1) = 61.46, p < .01). Generators
(80%) mentioned novelty more than implementers (13%, χ2
(1) = 70.01, p < .01). Thus, this manipulation led
participants to adopt the intended roles and associated
concerns.
In Part two, participants rated an idea for a “waterproof
fleece,” which “uses a soft, breathable and waterproof fabric
using bio-mimicry to replicate the properties of a leaf in the
Amazon rain forest that repels water yet is also very soft
and pliable to the touch.” The high novelty idea was
described as a “completely new technology not currently
available in the marketplace,” while the low novelty idea
was described as “an existing technology currently available
in the marketplace.” In a pilot study (N = 54), participants
(not put in any role) rated the high or low novelty idea as:
new and original (assessing novelty, α = .86), useful and
valuable (assessing usefulness, α = .73), and creative and

1039

innovative (assessing creativity, α = .83). Participants rated
the low novelty idea (M = 4.70) as less novel than the high
novelty idea (M = 5.83, t(53) = 3.53, p < .01), but
comparably useful (M = 6.00) to the high novelty idea (M =
5.89, t(53) = -.45, ns). In addition, participants rated the low
novelty idea (M = 5.22) as less creative than the high
novelty idea (M = 5.70, t(53) = 2.68, p < .05). Thus, the
level of novelty was noticeable and produced a shift in
perceived creativity. Participants in the main study rated the
ideas using the same creativity, usefulness and novelty
scales (all alphas above .70).

low novelty ideas on creativity assessments through novelty
(mean effect estimate = .57, SE = .205; 95% CI 1.025 to
.225, i.e., does not include 0), but there was no indirect
effect through usefulness (mean effect estimate = .05, SE =
.04; 95% CI -.0061 to .166, i.e., includes 0). For
implementers, we found the opposite pattern. There was
evidence of an indirect effect of high and low novelty ideas
on creativity assessments through usefulness (mean effect
estimate = .098, SE = .064, 95% CI .0024 to .2598), but not
through novelty (mean effect estimate = .0084, SE = .145;
95% CI -.287 to .289). Accordingly, generators’ ratings of
creativity seemed driven by novelty and implementers’
ratings of creativity seemed driven by usefulness.

Results
A multivariate ANOVA identified interactions between role
(generator or implementer) and idea type (high or low
novelty) when predicting creativity ratings (F(1, 172) =
38.38, p < .01, η² = .15), novelty ratings (F(1, 172) = 9.00,
p < .05, η² = .03) and usefulness ratings (F(1, 172) =
7.75, p < .05, η² = .05). Planned comparisons revealed a
crossover interaction such that generators rated the high
novelty idea as significantly more creative (M = 6.04) than
implementers (M = 5.43, t(86) = 3.48, p < .01, η² = .19;
Figure 1). Generators rated the low novelty idea as
significantly less creative (M = 4.62) than implementers (M
= 5.91, t(86) = -4.40, p < .01, η² = .02). The critical
finding was that implementers saw the low novelty idea as
more creative than the high novelty idea (t(71) = -2.06, p <
.05, η² = .14), whereas generators saw the low novelty idea
as less creative than the high novelty idea (t(101) = 6.08, p
< .01, η² = .04).
Regarding novelty, generators saw the low novelty idea as
less novel (M = 4.57) than implementers (M = 5.30, t(86) =
-2.31, p < .05, η² = .04), but generators (M = 5.47) and
implementers (M = 5.29) had comparable ratings of the high
novelty idea (t(86) = .81, p = ns; see Figure 2, η² = .003).
Generators rated the high novelty idea as more novel than
the low novelty idea (t(101) = 3.48, p < .01, η² = .07),
whereas implementers did not show a detectable difference
(t(71) = -.06, ns, η² = .00).
Regarding usefulness, implementers saw the high novelty
idea as less useful (M = 5.36) than generators (M = 5.79,
t(86) = 1.99, p < .05; see Figure 3, η² = .03).
Implementers also saw the low novelty idea as more useful
(M = 5.95) than generators (M = 5.53, t(73) = -.2.14, p <
.05, η² = .02). While generators saw no difference in the
extent to which high (M = 5.79) and low (M = 5.53) novelty
ideas were useful (t(101) = 1.49, p = ns, , η² = .01),
implementers viewed the low novelty idea as more useful
than the high novelty idea (t(71) = -2.41, p < .05 , η² =
.04).
To further examine the relationship between roles,
novelty and usefulness, and assessments of creativity, we
conducted two parallel mediation analyses, one for each
role, in which both novelty and usefulness were entered as
possible mediators of creativity assessments (using the
approach in Preacher, Rucker & Hayes, 2007). We found
that for generators, there was an indirect effect of high and

ratings by role (implementer, generator) and idea type (high
novelty, low novelty), Experiment 1.

Discussion
Adopting generator and implementer roles can lead people
to form different assessments of creativity. Generators
perceived a high novelty idea as more novel and creative but
no more useful than a low novelty idea. This is consistent
with the generator role evoking a lay theory that emphasizes
novelty when assessing creativity. However, separating an
effect of role-based expectancies from task demands driven
by role instructions (we told generators to focus on novelty,
and so they did) is challenging. We will present a better test
of the generator role in Study 2.
The more striking pattern came from implementers, who
assessed a high novelty idea as less useful and creative, but
not more novel, than a low novelty idea. These data do not
suffer from the same concern as the generator role data.
Implementers were told to focus on usefulness, but they
were not told to ignore novelty, and the ideas that they rated
provided no direct information about usefulness. Thus, it is
noteworthy that the implementers evaluated the high
novelty idea as less useful than the low novelty idea,
because it suggests that they were employing the lay theory
that highly novel ideas are likely untested and risky and so
lower in usefulness and lower in creativity.

1040

Experiment 2
Study 2 tested high and low usefulness ideas. The key
prediction is that generators should assess a high usefulness
idea as less novel and creative than a low usefulness idea,
due to a lay theory that an idea high in usefulness indicates
less novelty and so less creativity. Our account also predicts
that implementers should assess the high usefulness idea as
more useful and more creative than the low usefulness idea.

Method
Participants and Design We recruited 161 participants
from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (64% male, M = 30.42
years, SD = 12.17). Participants had an average of 9.75 (SD
= 10.62) years of work experience. Participants were
randomly assigned to one of four conditions of a 2 (role:
generator, implementer) X 2 (idea usefulness: high, low)
between-subjects design. Each cell contained more than 29
cases.
Procedure and Materials The only difference with Study 1
was the idea being rated. We used the high novelty idea
from Study 1, so everyone rated an idea that was explicitly
marked as being highly novel. We added that the idea was
“cheap and easy to make” (in the high usefulness condition)
or “costly and difficult to make” (in the low usefulness
condition).

5.51) usefulness ideas reliably differently in usefulness
(t(69) = .01, p = ns, η² = .00).
For generators, we found evidence of an indirect effect of
high and low usefulness ideas on creativity assessments
through novelty (mean effect estimate = .35, SE = .176;
95% CI .06 to .76), but there was no indirect effect through
usefulness (mean effect estimate = -.002, SE = .09; 95% CI
-.129 to .218). For implementers, there was evidence of an
indirect effect of high and low usefulness ideas on creativity
assessments through usefulness (mean effect estimate = .12,
SE = .063, 95% CI .028 to .282), but not through novelty
(mean effect estimate = -.193, SE = .111; 95% CI -.423 to
.009). Once again, generators’ ratings of creativity seemed
linked to novelty and implementers’ ratings of creativity
seemed linked to usefulness.

Results
A multivariate ANOVA identified interactions between role
(generator or implementer) and idea type (high or low
usefulness) when predicting creativity ratings (F(1, 157) =
20.06, p < .01, η² = .11) and novelty ratings (F(1, 157) =
8.51, p < .01, η² = .05), but only a marginally significant
trend for usefulness ratings (F(1, 157) = 3.10, p = .08, η² =
.01). Planned comparisons revealed a crossover interaction
for creativity ratings (Figure 2). Generators rated the high
usefulness idea as less creative (M = 5.14) than
implementers (M = 6.07, t(76) = -3.95, p < .01, η² = .10;
see Figure 4). Generators also rated the low usefulness idea
as more creative (M = 5.88) than implementers (M = 5.46,
t(81) = 2.19, p < .05, η² = .03). Implementers saw the high
usefulness idea as more creative than the low usefulness
idea (t(88) = 3.36, p < .05, η² = .06), whereas generators
recognized the low usefulness idea as more creative than the
high novelty idea (t(69) = -2.96, p < .05, η² = .06).
Regarding novelty and usefulness, generators saw the
high usefulness idea as less novel (M = 4.97) than
implementers (M = 5.81, t(76) = -3.11, p < .05, η² = .06),
but generators (M = 5.61) and implementers (M = 5.41)
gave comparable novelty ratings to the low usefulness idea
(t(81) = .83, p = ns, η² = .004; see Figure 5). Generators
rated the low usefulness idea as more novel than the high
usefulness idea (t(69) = -2.33, p < .05, η² = .04), whereas
implementers saw no difference (t(88) = 1.72, ns, η² = .02).
Also as expected, implementers viewed the high usefulness
idea (M = 6.04) as more useful than the low usefulness idea
(M = 5.41, t(88) = 2.63, p < .05, η² = .04; see Figure 6).
Generators did not rate the high (M = 5.52) and low (M =

Figure 2. Means and 95% confidence intervals of creativity
ratings by role (implementer, generator) and idea type (high
usefulness, low usefulness), Experiment 2.

Discussion
Study 2 found the complementary pattern to Study 1.
Unsurprisingly, adopting the implementer role led people to
rate the high usefulness idea as more useful and more
creative than the low usefulness idea, although separating
out role-based expectancies from task demand based on the
role instructions is challenging. What is more clearly
compelling though is that adopting the generator role led
people to rate the high usefulness idea as less novel and less
creative than the low usefulness idea. This occurred despite
both ideas being described as completely new, which was
the primary concern of the generator role. That high
usefulness meant lower novelty for generators is consistent
with our proposal that generator roles evoke a lay theory
that high usefulness indicates a lesser challenge and
deviation in practice and so a lower degree of creativity.

General Discussion
The social roles used to distribute the process of innovation
appear to lead to different assessments of creativity, the very
issue on which people in those roles need to coordinate. The

1041

generator role seemed to invoke lay theories that novelty is
key to an idea being creative, and that highly useful ideas
lack novelty. The implementer role seemed to invoke lay
theories that usefulness is key to an idea being creative, and
that highly novel ideas lack creativity because they are less
useful.
A strength of the approach in these studies was that we
ensured that there were no systematic knowledge
differences by randomly assigning roles, as in practice role
differences are likely confounded with knowledge
differences. Knowledge differences could also, in addition
to role-driven expectancies or other sets of goals, guide
perceptions of novelty and usefulness, and alter creativity
assessments. In additional exploratory data analyses, we
also examined the possibility that work experience could
have influenced responses. However, we found no signs of
effects of years of work experience, nor did we find any
signs of effects of whether or not participants had prior
work experience in generator roles (about 30% did) or
implementer roles (about 20% did). Thus, we have
evidence that assigning individuals to roles led them to
adopt the goals and perspective of those roles, and that
individuals with and without actual work experience in the
roles produced comparable assessments.
One theoretical possibility highlighted by these studies is
that at least for complex categories, such as creativity,
meanings may vary systematically in multiple ways. There
are already good reasons to believe that category meanings
are not fixed for speakers of the natural language but rather
vary across cultural communities (Clark, 1996; Keller &
Loewenstein, 2011). If the studies here generalize, then
there may be further social fractionation in category
meanings driven by roles. Of interest, just as individuals can
code switch from one cultural vocabulary to another, they
can also change roles. Thus, individuals’ understandings
and use of categories might shift systematically as they
adopt different roles and identify with different
communities. There are not just context effects but social
context effects that draw on histories of experience and
social interaction. Just because individuals generate their
own understandings of categories does not imply that their
understandings are constant, internally consistent, or driven
by one goal or causal logic.
The effects of social roles on creativity also emphasizes
the need for a more comprehensive theoretical account of
social context on creativity assessments. This would go
alongside work on the effects of social context on creative
production (Amabile, 1983; Kim, Vincent, & Goncalo,
2012). Future work could examine whether situational
factors apart from roles also guide creativity assessments.
For example, situational uncertainty (Whitson & Galinsky,
2008) might activate the lay theory that highly novel ideas
are not creative because they have uncertain use (cf.,
Mueller et al., 2012), and so guide creativity assessments.
The generator-implementer difference in creativity
assessments that we found suggests a practical problem,
because effective coordination hinges on mutual

understanding (Okhuysen & Bechky, 2009). If
implementers and generators do not agree about which ideas
are creative, this should lead to conflict, frustration and
rejection. Apparently, the division of labor in the innovation
process brings with it a division of cognitive labor that is
not just about who knows what (Keil, Stein, Webb, Billings,
& Rozenblit, 2010), but is also about perspectives and
perhaps attitudes. Indeed, editors may select articles they
view as “creative” but that researchers view as “same old,
same old,” whereas editors view that researchers often
pursue “pie-in-the-sky” ideas without grounding them in
existing methods. Governments may fund research projects
that scientists think perpetuate existing paradigms rather
than testing new ones, while grant decision-makers might
view many scientists pursuing ideas with little practical
value to society. Managers may view that designers
generating new products focus on extremely cutting edge
ideas that are too costly and expensive to produce at a profit,
while the designers view that managers implement old and
tired ideas to “make a buck.” The result may well be a
stubborn coordination challenge on the core task of
generating and implementing creative ideas. Or, perhaps at
different points in the innovation process, generators and
implementers might consider adopting the perspective of the
alternative role. Because the true paradox of this paper is
that, ironically, both roles may be right.
