between-subjects design. Each cell contained more than 29
cases.
Procedure and Materials The only difference with Study 1
was the idea being rated. We used the high novelty idea
from Study 1, so everyone rated an idea that was explicitly
marked as being highly novel. We added that the idea was
“cheap and easy to make” (in the high usefulness condition)
or “costly and difficult to make” (in the low usefulness
condition).
Results
A multivariate ANOVA identified interactions between role
(generator or implementer) and idea type (high or low
usefulness) when predicting creativity ratings (F(1, 157) =
20.06, p < .01, η² = .11) and novelty ratings (F(1, 157) =         Figure 2. Means and 95% confidence intervals of creativity
