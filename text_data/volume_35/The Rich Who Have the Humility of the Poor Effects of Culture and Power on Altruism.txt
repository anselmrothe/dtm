The Dictator’s Game. The Dictator’s game (Bolton et al.,
1998) is a commonly used game for evaluating levels of
altruism and prosocial behavior. In the standard form of the
dictator’s game, one player (the dictator) is asked to share a
fixed amount of money between himself and another
participant (the receiver), while both players remain
anonymous. According to economic models of decision-
making, rational players are expected to maximize their
personal benefit. Thus, the dictator should take all the
money, leaving nothing for the receiver. Many studies,
however, have shown that dictators give between 20%-30%
of the money to the unknown receiver (e.g. Camerer, 2011).
   For this experiment, we developed a variation of the
Dictator’s game. As previously mentioned, in the standard
form of the game, the dictator is asked to share a fixed
amount of money between himself and the receiver. Due to
the design of our experiment, we needed all participants to
perform the role of the dictator. Hence, participants were
instructed to take as much of the money as they want,
leaving the rest for future unknown participants.
Specifically, in our experiment, subjects were told that they        Figure 1: Self-evaluation of legitimacy among participants.
