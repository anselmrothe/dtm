about four. However, when words come in meaningful
groups, we can remember dozens of words, even when the
message is unfamiliar. The most likely candidate for this

representation. By presenting article usages to learners as
meaningful groups, we help learners form the conceptual
representation of the article system. In turn, storage cost is
reduced.
