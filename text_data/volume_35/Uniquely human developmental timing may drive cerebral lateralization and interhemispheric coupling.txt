this is not the case at all. For example, when examining in-
terhemispheric correlations through resting-state fMRI, Stark
et al. (2008) found very strong interhemispheric correlations
between association areas. Reduced interhemispheric coher-
ence (measured with EEG) at locations away from primary
sensory/motor cortices has been measured in mental disabil-

Althaus, 2010) and schizophrenia (Hoptman et al., 2012).
   Hellige (2006) points out that functional specializations
tend to be complementary. For example, visual processing
of the left hemisphere seems biased towards high frequency
processing, while the right hemisphere seems biased towards
low-frequency processing (Sergent, 1982; Ivry & Robertson,           Figure 1: (a) The model architecture of Ringo et al. (1994).
