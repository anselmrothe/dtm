with a test trial containing 8 words and 8 non-words. Both
dative and genitive marked words were represented in this
set of test items. In the test trial items remained on the
screen until the participant had pressed the correct button.
The instructor remained in the room during the test trail and
participants were able to ask questions. After that the
instructor left the room and participants were presented with
the three blocks of 160 items each (with one minute pauses
in between). The testing took 15-20 minutes.
   After finishing the main experiment, participants were
presented with a questionnaire to clarify 1) whether they had
guessed what the exact purpose of the experiment is; 2)
whether they had issues with specific items; 3) whether they
had used any specific strategy to decide on words with
dative and genitive marking. Participants could use the
keyboard to type their answers, but they were also told that
they can just type “no” if they did not want to answer the
questions.
3.2 Results
A pre-analysis of the data revealed that 4 participants had to
be excluded from the dataset because they had guessed the
purpose of the experiment. Also, three of the items4 were
excluded because their per item error rate exceeded 50%.
The error rates per subject ranged from 1.6% to 21%. No
further subjects were excluded. This left 22 subjects and 117
items to be analyzed. Furthermore, RTs were cleaned by
excluding all RTs of less than 300ms for reasons of lower
processing bounds (Baayen, 2008: 243). Also, all RTs
longer than 3000ms were excluded because both inspection
of quantile-quantile plots (Baayen, 2008: 243) as well as
considering 2-3 standard deviations from the overall mean
(mean: 959ms; SD: 934ms) as a cut-off point suggested that
3000ms are a realistic upper bound for RTs. Moreover, for
the analysis of reaction times all incorrect responses were
excluded from the sample. These cleaning procedures
caused an additional data loss of ~8%.
   In the following, the RTs for the N-Groups and S-Groups
are analyzed separately. Plotting the subgroups and
logarithmically transformed RTs for each group reveals that            Figure 1: Boxplots for log(RTs), inflectional categories
