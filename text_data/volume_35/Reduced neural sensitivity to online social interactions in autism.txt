conditions revealed many similarities but also some
differences from the sample published in a previous paper
(Redcay et al., 2010). In general a smaller number of areas
were recruited during the Live vs. Recorded contrast than
reported in the previous study. Specifically, subcortical
regions associated with reward and anterior temporal
regions did not show differential recruitment during the
Live condition. However, regions within dorsal medial
prefrontal cortex (dMPFC), which did not meet threshold
for significance in the 2010 paper, were significant in the
current NT sample. Regions showing a greater response to
Live than Recorded conditions (in both samples) included
bilateral posterior STS, dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC),
dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC), thalamus, and left
cerebellum (Figure 2, top).
   Next, we compared parameter estimates for Live and
Recorded conditions within the ROIs from the previous
study using one-way paired samples t-tests (p<.05,
