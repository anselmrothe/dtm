For the category toys there were several items for which the
difference in proportion was determined meaningful after
controlling for the threshold criterion. The RIM model
indicated that the items pin-ball machine, gocart, coloured
pencil, and chalk (manly items); and dollhouse and
skipping rope (womanly items) are DIF items. That is,
according to the model, the categorization differences one
observes for these items are representational in nature.
