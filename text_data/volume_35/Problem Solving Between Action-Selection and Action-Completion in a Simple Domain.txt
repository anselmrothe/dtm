this evaluation occurs in a single cycle of the system, and is
only necessary if there is a conflict between two or more
possible actions. For example in SOAR (Newell, 1990)
preference rules are used for conflict resolution, while in
ACT-r (Anderson, 2007) the relative utility of actions is
considered. In TOL-GLAM, and more generally in the
GLAM-PS architecture, the evaluation of an action is a
protracted process, typically involving the evaluation of a
single action, rather than multiple competing actions.
   Although the current research focuses on a simple
knowledge-lean domain (ToL), the issue explored is
fundamental to understanding human thought. Current
accounts (e.g. ACT-r, SOAR) appear to suggest that we
