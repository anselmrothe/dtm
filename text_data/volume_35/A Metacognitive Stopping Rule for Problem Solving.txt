higher confidence ratings regarding lengthy solutions with
misleading problems than regarding CRA problems.
However, despite this finding, a negative correlation
between time and confidence was found even with the
misleading problems. This might indicate that even with
these problems, people see relatively low confidence levels
as satisfying after lengthy thinking, as suggested here. To
examine this possibility, Experiment 2 examined whether
the “don’t know” option allows the participants to avoid the
low confidence solutions, with the hypothesis that it will
not. Like in Experiment 1, all participants provided
