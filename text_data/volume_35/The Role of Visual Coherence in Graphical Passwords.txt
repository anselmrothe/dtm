                            Results
In the last phase of the first session, the participants were
asked to login the system by clicking on a black grid screen,
without the graphical password image on the screen. This
screen consisted of nine black squares in the form of a grid.
The motivation for using the black screen was to investigate
participants’ strategy for choosing the password items. If the
participant chose password just by memorizing object
properties, without memorizing the spatial locations, s/he
would not be able to log in without seeing the graphical
password image. This was a surprise task for the
