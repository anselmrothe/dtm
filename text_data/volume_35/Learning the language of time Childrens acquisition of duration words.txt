Experiment 2
    Experiment 2 assessed children’s ability to integrate their
knowledge of number with their understanding of time
words, pitting the Ordinal and Ratio hypotheses against one
another by probing the specificity of children’s knowledge
of the relative lengths of time referred to by conventional
duration terms. In Congruent trials (e.g., 3 hours vs. 2
minutes), the numbers provide an additional cue to the
correct answer. Even a child with no idea how long either an
hour or a minute is might still choose correctly, based solely
on his understanding of 3 vs. 2, thus improving overall
performance on Congruent relative to Same/No Number
trials. We expect the children with the least precise
understanding of time words to show the greatest increase in
performance in Congruent relative to Same trials. However,
