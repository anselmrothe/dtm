  Figure 1. Examples of two-player Marble Drop games. A white marble is about to drop, and its path can be manipulated by
    turning the orange and blue trapdoors. In these example games, participants have to obtain as many orange diamonds as
     possible and they control the orange trapdoors. The other player has to obtain as many blue diamonds as possible and
  controls the blue trapdoor. In game a, the optimal decision for a participant is to let the white marble drop into the topmost
 bin, thereby obtaining 3 orange marbles. The 4 orange diamonds in the bottom-left bin are not obtainable, as the other (blue)
      player’s optimal decision is to let the white marble drop into the middle bin: The other player knows that the optimal
     (orange) decision at the bottom trapdoors is to go left, yielding a suboptimal outcome of 1 blue diamond for Player 2.
  Games a and c are second-order games, because participants (as Player 1) have to reason about the other player (i.e., Player
     2) who in turn has to reason about Player 1. The games in b and d are first-order counterparts of the games in a and c,
