Analogically, for negatively related gambles the relation is:
                                                                                                     2rσA σB

and correlation is equal to standardized covariance when
                       2σA σB = σ2A + σ2B .                 (6)
Because for stochastically non-dominant options with two
outcomes correlation is always either −1 or 1, σAB = σA σB .
Therefore, the relation between the sum of variances and the
product of the standard deviation is the same as the relation
between the sum of variances and the covariance. Thus, stan-
dardized covariance could also be written as
                                 2σA σB

In stochastically non-dominant pairs of options which are not
identical, one option has higher variance than the other (com-
pare range of outcomes of options A and B in Table 1 in
Examples 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, to Example 6 which contains a
stochastically dominant pair of options). Therefore the sum
of variances is composed of a smaller and larger variance.
   The relation between the smaller variance and covariance
is close to linear and is symmetric with respect to the x-axis.
In contrast, the relation of the larger variance to covariance
takes the shape of a triangular area and is also symmetric with
respect to the x-axis, as shown in Figure 1. This figure shows
