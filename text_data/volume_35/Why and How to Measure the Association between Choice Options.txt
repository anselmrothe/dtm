Abstract
Prominent theories of decision making, such as proportional
difference model, priority heuristics, decision field theory and
regret theory assume that people do not evaluate options independently of each other. Instead, these theories predict that
people compare the options’ outcomes with each other. Therefore the theories’ predictions strongly depend on the association between outcomes. In the present work, we examine how
the association between options can be best described. For options with two outcomes the standard correlation measure between option’s outcomes does not provide a meaningful interpretation. Therefore, we propose the standardized covariance
between options A and B, denoted as σ∗AB . We describe the
properties and interpretation of this measurement and show its
similarities and differences with the correlation measurement.
Finally, we show how the predictions of different models of decision making vary depending on the value of the standardized
covariance.

Introduction
Standard economic models of decision making like expected
utility theory assume that people evaluate choice options independently of each other (Neumann & Morgenstern, 1944).
However, contrary to this basic independence assumption
a vast amount of evidence has shown that people evaluate
choice option depending on the set of alternative choice options (see Rieskamp, Busemeyer, & Mellers, 2006 for more
details).
For example, choice of between two health insurance offers
is a choice between risky options with payouts depending on
the occurence of an illness. An illness can occur with a certain
probability that can be estimated based on teh patient’s age
and health history. When deciding between the two options,
one would probably compare the insurance coverage in case
of specific illnesses of both offers with each other, rather than
first evaluate one offer and then another.
Many cognitive models of decision making assume that
when people make choices between options they compare the
options’ outcomes with each other. For instance, the priority
heuristics (Brandstätter, Giegerenzer, & Hertwig, 2006) assumes that people first compare all options with respect to
their minimum outcomes. If these outcomes do not allow to
discriminate the options, the options are compared with respect to the probability of the minimum outcomes, and so
forth. Regret theory (Loomes & Sugden, 1982), proportional

difference model (González-Vallejo, 2002), and decision field
theory (Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993) are three other prominent models of decision making assuming that people compare options with respect to their outcomes. These comparisons are then accumulated to form an overall preference.
Therefore the predictions of all these models depend on the
associations between the outcomes of options.
How can these associations be best characterized? Using
the covariance of the options’ outcomes would be a sound
solution, especially because many of the studies of decision
making use monetary choices which are an analogy to investments. Indeed, in portfolio management covariance plays an
important role for selection of assets (i.e. Pafka & Kondor,
2003; Disatnik & Benninga, 2007).
Also, many studies investigating decision making focus on
comparing various models. In such case, the selection of the
choice options, which are usually presented as gambles, is
very important. As highlighted in the work on optimal experimental design, selecting gambles for discriminating between
the models, is an essential issue that determines the effectiveness of the experiment (see Cavagnaro, Gonzalez, Myung, &
Pitt, 2013; Myung & Pitt, 2009; Zhang & Lee, 2010) The
main problem with using covariance is that its value depends
on the range of the outcomes’ values which makes it hard to
interpret.
As an alternative measurement one could use the correlation between the outcomes. However, a large part of the
research is done with two-outcome choice problems (e.g.
González-Vallejo, 2002; Birnbaum, 2008), for which correlation is either 1 or −1 (see Rodgers & Nicewander, 1988),
so that the correlation measurement does not provide a meaningful interpretation.
Therefore, we propose an alternative measurement, standardized covariance, as a measure of the strength of the association between the options’ outcomes, which can be easily
interpreted. In the following sections we will first explain
how the standardized covariance is determined and how it
should be understood. Next, we will present relations between the covariance, variances and expected value of twooutcome gambles, which will clarify the construction of the
standardized covariance. Finally, we will show how decision
making models make different predictions depending on the
strength of the standardized covariance.

Situation from Equation 2 occurs when both options are
the same (Example 1 in Table 1) and, analogically, by interchanging the outcomes of Option B we can obtain choice
options for which σ∗AB = −1 (Example 2), which shows the
symmetricity of options with positive and negative σ∗AB . Further, as shown in Examples 3 and 4, by altering one outcome
from Option B so that the options are not the same any more,
we obtain options with slightly lower σ∗AB . Interrestingly, the
probabilities of the outcomes do not influence σ∗AB (compare
Examples 3 and 5). Also, the ”perfect association” does not
occur only when the options are identical, but also, when the
difference between outcomes of option A and B is the same
and this difference is the difference between expected values (Example 6 with the difference in expected values of 10
points). By making the outcomes corresponding to the same
probabilities more dissimilar, one can decrease σ∗AB (compare
Examples 3 and 7). Finally, as shown in Example 8, when
outcomes of one option are almost the same (almost a sure
thing), while outcomes of the other option are dissimilar, σ∗AB
is almost 0.
For stochastically non-dominant options, σ∗AB is not higher
than 1 or lower than -1 because it is not true that 2σAB >
(σ2A + σ2B ). Below, we provide the mathematical proof.
Proof. 2σAB > (σ2A + σ2B ) is false

Standardized Covariance
We denote standardized covariance of a pair of dependent
choice options A and B, with each having two possible outcomes, as σ∗AB , where the non-standardized covariance is denoted as σAB . Standardized covariance is equal to twice the
covariance divided by the sum of the variances σA and σB of
each of the options (see Equation 1).

In stochastically non-dominant options the variances of options’ outcomes are unequal, thus σ2A < σ2B ∨ σ2A > σ2B .
σ2A < σ2B ⇐⇒ σ2B = σ2A + s ∧ s ∈ R+
Then,
2σAB > σ2A + σ2B
2σAB > 2σ2A + s
0 > σ2A + 2s − σAB

For stochastically non-dominant options, σ∗AB is a continuous variable ranging from -1 (strong negative association) to
1 (strong positive association). When σ∗AB = 0 either the options are completely unrelated (e.g. they are statistically independent, where two options do not depend on one external event) or the covariance between the options’ outcomes is
equal to 0. The second case occurs, when one of the options
is a sure thing. When σ∗AB approaches 0, the variances of both
options are low, and so is the association between the options.

Since g2 > 0 the inequality is false.

Standardized Covariance vs. Correlation
Examples presented in Table 1 indicate that there are similarities between correlation and standardized covariance and the
”perfect” correlation overlaps with the ”perfect” standardized
covariance (e.g. Examples 1, 2 and 3 in Table 1). Correlation
coefficient r equals to

When σ∗AB reaches its maximum at 1 then the sum of the variances equals twice the covariance:
σ∗AB = 1 ⇐⇒ 2σAB = σ2A + σ2B .

Analogically, for negatively related gambles the relation is:
σ∗AB = −1 ⇐⇒ −2σAB = σ2A + σ2B .

The relation between correlation coefficient and standardized
covariance is as follows:

and correlation is equal to standardized covariance when
2σA σB = σ2A + σ2B .

(6)

Because for stochastically non-dominant options with two
outcomes correlation is always either −1 or 1, σAB = σA σB .
Therefore, the relation between the sum of variances and the
product of the standard deviation is the same as the relation
between the sum of variances and the covariance. Thus, standardized covariance could also be written as
σ∗AB =

2σA σB
σ2A + σ2B

(7)

when the association between the options’ outcomes is positive. When the association between the options’ outcomes is
negative, σAB = −2σA σB .

Variances and Covariance of Two-Outcome
Options
In stochastically non-dominant pairs of options which are not
identical, one option has higher variance than the other (compare range of outcomes of options A and B in Table 1 in
Examples 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, to Example 6 which contains a
stochastically dominant pair of options). Therefore the sum
of variances is composed of a smaller and larger variance.
The relation between the smaller variance and covariance
is close to linear and is symmetric with respect to the x-axis.
In contrast, the relation of the larger variance to covariance
takes the shape of a triangular area and is also symmetric with
respect to the x-axis, as shown in Figure 1. This figure shows
a very interesting pattern in which the graph on the right
side fits into the graph on the left side like ”key and lock”.
The data points in Figure 1 were obtained from 100000 randomly generated two-outcome choice options, with various
differences between expected values. The outcomes’ values
ranged between 1 and 100, and probabilities of their occurrence ranged between 1 and 99%.
The relation between the sum of variances and covariance
is symmetric with respect to the x-axis (Figure 2). The gray
data points, which lay on the diagonal of the graph in Figure 2, are the only ones, for which standardized covariance is
equal to correlation. This is the key property of standardized
covariance, as the gray points correspond to the ”perfect correlation” between the options, for which equation 6 holds. In
contrast, all black points represent the pairs of options whose
relation varies between -1 and 1 (not perfect correlation).

Options with Negative and Mixed Outcomes
Until now, we have discussed the properties of standardized
covariance, covariance and variances of options which generate only positive outcomes. However, some experiments
might include choice options which generate only losses or
might generate both, gains and losses. As a consequence,
we randomly generated stochastically non-dominant options
with only negative outcomes (N = 100000), to which we will
refer as negative options, and options that have one positive

secure option) and covariance between two-outcome options,
Right: relation between the higher variance (more risky option) and covariance between two-outcome options.

or σ∗AB = r = −1.
and one negative outcome (N = 100000), which we call mixed
options. The outcomes of negative options varied between
−100 and −1 points, while the outcomes of mixed options
were in range [−100, 1] and [1, 100] points. The probabilities of these outcomes ranged from 1% to 99%. We repeated
the analysis of the relation between variances and covariance,
as well as the sum of variances and the product of standard
deviations of the options for the two new types of options.
The obtained results for the negative and mixed options
were the same as for the positive options. Thus, the properties
of the choice options regarding their variances, covariance
and the standardized covariance, depicted in Figures 1 and 2,
apply to various kinds of choice options. The only difference
is that the range of the values of variances and covariance
of mixed options is much greater (range: [−10000, 10000]).
This is due to the fact that the range of the possible values is
twice as big compared to the positive and negative options. In
sum, standardized covariance is a stable measure of association between options.

Options with More than Two Outcomes
In order to analyze in more detail the relation between the correlation measure and the standardized covariance, one would
have to extend the problem to choices with more than two

σ AB

Standardized covariance is sensitive to the differences between expected values of two choice options. We generated
all possible pairs of options with outcomes and probabilities
as previously, for which the difference between the expected
values was either 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30. As shown in Table 2, the greater the difference between expected values,
the more narrow the range of possible values of σ∗AB . Thus,
when manipulating the difference between the expected value
of pairs of options, our analysis shows that this manipulation
will most likely also change the covariance of the options
outcomes. Thus, when not controlling for this aspect, then
variations of the expected value differences will often be confounded with variations of covariance differences. Therefore,
the experimenters should keep in mind that the strength of
the association between the gambles that they present to the
participants may depend on the differences between expected
values (∆EV ).
Interestingly, the greater the difference between the expected values, the fewer choice options could be obtained
(see Table 2). Also, the greater the difference between expected values, the more narrow the ranges of possible values
of standardized covariance and ratio between the lower and
the higher variance within the pair of options (see Table 2).
Therefore, in experiments that control for the expected value
difference, it might be the standardized covariance between
the options that influences people’s choice, rather than the
expected value.
Further, we selected a group of options for which ∆EV =
15. For these options with fixed difference between expected
values, we tested the relation between the variances of both
options. As shown in Figure 3, the data points create a pattern
that is symmetric with respect to the diagonal of the graph. In
other words, when ∆EV is fixed, the variances of both options
are related to each other with respect to a certain ratio, whose
ranges we listed in Table 2.

possible outcomes. Therefore, we generated 10000 pairs of
stochastically non-dominant options with four outcomes. The
outcomes varied between 1 and 100 points, and probabilities
varied betweeen 1% and 40%.
Firstly, we investigated the relations between the variances
and the covariance. As shown in Figure 4, the relations between both variances and covariance do not display the ”keylock” pattern as in Figure 1, and the patterns are not symmetrical. Analogically, the relation between the sum of variances
and twice the covariance is not symmetric with respect to the
x-axis.
Secondly, we looked at the relation between correlation
and standardized covariance. Figure 5 shows a strong relation between the correlation measure and standardized covariance. Pearson correlation between these two measures is
very strong, r = .98, p < .001. In the current sample of generated pairs of options, covariance and correlation are equal
to each other for 24% of the cases. Also, the slope of the
regression line is high and the intercept very small (see caption of Figure 5). Thus, standardized covariance is a similar
measure as correlation, but it has the advantage that it can be

applied to both two-outcome choice options and options with
several outcomes.

Model Predictions Depending on the
Standardized Covariance
In the previous sections, we have described features of
stochastically non-dominant options with two outcomes and
how one could measure the association between the options
with the use of standardized covariance. In this section, we
will show why the association between two options is important, based on two prominent theories of decision making,
regret theory and decision field theory. Models of decision
making generate different predictions for options with various differences between expected values. Thus, we focused
on the choice options for which ∆EV = 15.
For all of these options we generated predictions of the two
models. Following Pathan, Bonsall, and Jong (2011), we defined the regret function of choosing option A over option B
with outcomes xi , i ∈ {1, 2} as
RiA = ln(1 + exp(β(xi − max(xiA , xiB )))).

(8)

The total regret from choosing option A equals to
RA = Σ2i=1 RiA .

(9)

Further, the probability of choosing option A over option B is
estimated using softmax rule
Pr(A|A, B) =

1
.
1 + exp(θ(RB − RA ))

(10)

β and θ are free parameters of the model. More details regarding regret theory is provided in Loomes and Sugden (1982).
A parsimonious version of decision field theory was used, as
described by Busemeyer and Townsend (1993).
The models’ predictions are expressed as probabilities of
choosing option A over B. We converted these results to
the prediction that the option with the higher expected value

Figure 6: Average predictions of regret theory and decision
field theory. To generate predictions the following parameters were used: regret theory β = .05, θ = 4.6, decision field
theory θ = 1.19. The parameter of decision field theory was
based on Rieskamp (2008) and the parameters of regret theory were adjusted so that the predictions of both models are
at the same level. Error bars indicate standard deviations.

would be chosen, which resulted in all predictions ranging between 0.5 and 1. Next, we grouped the options depending on their standardized covariance, such that group 1:
σ∗AB < 0.2 (21.2%), group 2: 0.2 < σ∗AB ≤ 0.5 (34.7%), group
3: 0.5 < σ∗AB (44.2%). For each of the three groups we calculated the mean prediction and its standard deviation.
As shown in Figure 6, the models’ predictions differ
among the three groups. This constitutes evidence that some
theories of decision making not only assume on a theoretical level that the relation between the options’ outcomes play
an important role in decision making, but also provide quantitative evidence. Therefore, one should control for the association between the options. This is a crucial property of
the standardized covariance, because in experiments in which
the association between options was not examined, the results
might depend on the selected set of choice options.
Furthermore, the models’ predictions for choices with the
same level of association could differ depending on the difference between expected values. From each group of options with difference between expected values of 10, 15, 20,
25 and 30 points, we picked all options for which σ∗AB = .3
and we generated models’ predictions using the same set of
parameters as previously. As shown in Figure 7, decision
field theory makes very systematic predictions in which the
higher the expected value difference, the higher the probability of choosing the option with the higher expected value. In
contrast, regret theory indicates some differences but no trend
can be observed.
In sum, predictions of models of decision making result
from the interaction between the difference between expected
values and the strength of the association between the choice
options. This finding is very important, as in most studies

the researchers do not even consider the covariance of the
options’ outcomes, but only report the differences in expected
values.

Discussion
The association between two options’ outcomes may play
an important role in testing models of decision making. As
we have shown, models can generate different predictions
depending on the combination of the expected value difference and the association between the options. Experiments
that control only for the expected value difference may obtain confounded results.
Therefore, a simple measure of the strength of this association is needed. For experiments that employ two-outcome
choice options, we proposed the standardized covariance. Its
values range between -1 and 1, where 1 indicates ”perfect
positive association” and -1 indicates ”perfect negative association”. When standardized covariance equals to 0, one of
the options is a sure thing. When standardized covariance
equals to -1, 0 and 1 it overlaps with correlation.
There is a strong association between correlation measure
and standardized covariance. This constitutes solid evidence
in favor of the reliability of the standardized covariance as a
measure of the association between two choice options. Interestingly, there are very clear patterns of relations between
variances and covariance of the two-outcome options. In contrast, these patterns are different when there are more outcomes. Therefore, future empirical research is needed to test
the applicability of the standardized covariance and its perception by human decision makers. Also, as a future investigation, we suggest that one should test whether the predictions of the aforementioned models of decision making reflect
the real human choice behavior.
In sum, this work was based on extensive simulations of
random choice options and choice options with specific properties. We have shown that standardized covariance is a ro-
