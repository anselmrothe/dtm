ate sustained oscillations, but to determine as well whether
it could account for other circadian phenomena. Of prime
importance is the ability of circadian clocks to be entrained
by light. Light had been shown experimentally to affect
PER expression, and hence Leloup and Goldbeter incorpo-
rated light in their diagrams as a black box with an arrow
feeding into the box for Per transcription. This in turn guid-
ed their strategy for simulating light exposure in the compu-
tational model: instead of a setting a single value for the
parameter vsP, which set the maximum rate of Per expres-
sion, they used a square wave function to alternate between
a high value (simulating light) and a low value (simulating
darkness). Leloup and Goldbeter were then able to use their
model to show that the mechanism’s responses to light ex-
posure varied with time of day in ways similar to the re-
sponses of mammals.
   Leloup and Goldbeter were also interested in whether the
proposed mechanism could be perturbed in ways that corre-
spond to known circadian pathologies. Advanced sleep
phase syndrome is a condition in which people naturally go
to sleep around 7 PM and rise around 3 AM. Genetic studies
of families with this pathology had revealed a mutation af-
fecting the interaction of PER with a kinase that phosphory-
lates it. The diagram includes the parameter v1P at this loca-
tion, and Leloup and Goldbeter showed that they could rep-
licate the characteristics of the pathology by altering it.
