another task).
                       2. Experiment
Participants and Design
Forty-seven Dutch native speakers (24 male; mean age 21;4)
were recruited from the Tilburg University student popula-
tion. The experiment had a one-way within-subjects design
with Eye Gaze Direction (direct, averted) as the independent
variable and Vocal Mimicry as the dependent variable.
Material
The stimulus material consisted of 8 visually presented words
during which we measured speakers’ baseline pitch, followed
by 48 videos (16 experimental trials + 32 distractors). Eight
of the 16 experimental trials involved direct gaze of the agent
(top figure 1), during the other 8, the agent either averted
his gaze left or right (4 times each). In half of the distractor
movies and only in these movies, the agent blinked his eyes;
the ratio of gaze directions was 8:4:4 for direct:left:right in
the blinking distractor group as well as in the no-blinking dis-
tractor group. In every stimulus, the agent expressed a single
word (all Dutch monosyllabic digits between 0-10, in order
to prevent possible emotional associations to the stimuli that
might affect the speaker’s pitch), followed by a blank screen.
   The virtual agent was created with Poser (Smitch Micro
Software inc, Aliso Viejo, California, U.S.), see Figure 1.
The agent’s lip movements were matched to the pre-recorded
words and subtle head and eye movements were added to en-
hance the realism and to prevent the agent from being per-
ceived as threatening (Ellsworth, 1975; Cook & Smith, 1975;
Argyle, Lefebvre, & Cook, 1974). A film strip of a sample
movie is shown in Figure 2.
   The sound files used for the agent’s voice were pre-
recorded in a sound attenuated booth by the second (male)
author. His pitch values represented average vocal values for
an adult male speaker in the Netherlands (i.e., in the 70–250
Hz range). Three different intonations were used in these
recordings (a falling, a rising, and a late-rising tune, see Fig-
ure 3). Each movie lasted approximately 5 s, including a 0.5 s        Figure 1: Impression of the virtual agent used in the exper-

                           3. Results
We start by reporting the vocal mimicry results regardless
of eye gaze direction. Subsequently, we report the gaze-
dependent vocal mimicry results. Non-parametric tests were
used for data that were not normally distributed.
Vocal Mimicry Results Independent of Gaze
Direction
A Wilcoxon Signed-rank test was performed to establish if
vocal mimicry √  occurred. Effect size estimates were computed
using r (= |Z/ N|), where N equals the number of samples.
The results for Pderiv and Pregline indicated a significant differ-
ence between the baseline and the experimental trial measure-
ments, with a shift in the direction of the agent’s pitch (see
Table 1). Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the results: Both figures
show the median values of the absolute differences between
the agent’s and the participant’s pitch in the baseline and the
repetition trial, with the results for males and females plotted
