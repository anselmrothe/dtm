                             Abstract
   In this paper we examine the idea of a "naïve physics" in
   humans solving physics problems. This invokes the idea that
   people have a theory of motion in their heads that is non-
   Newtonian, and hence leads to systematic errors on these
   problems. We are able to show that, by selecting our
   problems carefully, it is possible to obtain answers that are
   consistent with this naïve physics and inconsistent with it;
   suggesting that it is not used to solve these problems but
   sometimes offered as post-hoc justification for the answers
   given. We offer evidence that the answers given owe more to
   past experience than any theory, and that a theory that
   postulates extrapolation on the basis of associative memory
   can give a good account of our results.
