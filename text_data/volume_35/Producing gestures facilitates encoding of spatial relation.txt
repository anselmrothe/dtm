when encountering difficulty in describing complex spatial
patterns (Hostetter, Alibali, & Kita, 2007; Melinger & Kita,
2007).
   The present study asks whether asking participants to
produce gestures while encoding spatial relation information
would enhance subsequent spatial recall. We here focus on
gestures produced while thinking silently (i.e., co-thought
gestures, see Chu & Kita, 2011). If co-thought gestures
merely depict spatial relation, then participants who are told
to gesture when rehearsing spatial sequence silently should
recall comparable number of steps than those who are told
not to gesture. However, if co-thought gestures do more
than simply conveying spatial relation, i.e., they are
involved in encoding and constructing spatial relation, then
participants who are told to gesture during rehearsal should
recall more steps than those who are told not to gesture.
     In order to test the above hypotheses, adult participants
were told to study various routes and to rehearse the routes
by producing co-thought gestures (e.g., index finger moves
up and then to the right). We then compared their recall
performance to another three groups of learners who were
instructed, respectively, to rehearse the routes by actually
drawing them out on papers, to mentally rehearse the routes
while having their hand movements prohibited, and to read

conditions.
   We then assessed the accuracy of recall by considering
how many steps (out of thirteen) were correctly
reconstructed by sticks for each diagram. A step was
considered recalled correctly if the direction and sequence
of the corresponding stick matched those in the diagram.
The mean proportion of steps correctly recalled in each
diagram was calculated for each participant, which was the
number of steps correctly recalled, divided by thirteen (i.e.,
the total number of steps in the diagram). We also measured
the average amount of time (in seconds) each participant
spent on reconstructing each route (including all pauses and
hesitations)
