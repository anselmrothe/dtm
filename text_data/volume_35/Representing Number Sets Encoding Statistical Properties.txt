Abstract

when asked to make number comparisons, people implicitly
(i.e., without deliberate effort) represent the properties of
number sets, such as means and variance, rather than
information about individual numbers.

Previous research suggests that people often recall individual
items when sets are smaller than four and aggregate set
features for sets larger than four. One intriguing possibility is
that the process of aggregating sets creates summary
representations that maintain the statistical properties of the
set itself. For sets of numbers, this process might implicitly
create approximate means. We report the results of two
experiments investigating memory for number sets and its
relation to working memory and metacognitive monitoring. In
both experiments, participants were shown a series of data
sets that varied in size (4, 6, or 8 numbers) and variance (10%
or 20% of the mean) and were then presented with an actual
value from the set and the set mean. In Experiment 1,
participants were asked to select the actual value, and in
Experiment 2, participants were asked to select the set mean.
Results indicated that the proportion of correct selections and
metacognitive confidence decreased with set size. Working
memory was related to performance only when the set size
was 6. The findings suggest that participants often
erroneously reported the set mean as being a member of the
set and that this effect increased for sets larger than four. The
findings suggest that the process of aggregating number sets
results in approximate means.

Sets vs. Individuals
A well-replicated finding is that people individuate items
(i.e., represent individual values within a set) for sets
smaller than four (Scholl, 2001). For example, given a set of
three dots, participants are likely to remember the individual
dots rather than the properties shared by the dots (Airely,
2001). Given sets larger than four, people aggregate items,
or average over sets retaining information about set features
(Scholl, 2001; Masnick & Morris, 2008). For example,
given a set of a dozen dots of various sizes, participants
were likely to erroneously recall a dot that represents the
average size, rather than correctly recall an actual dot from
the set they viewed (Airely, 2001). Earlier research
suggested two separate memory stores for individual versus
aggregated sets. For example, Feigenson, Dehaene, and
Spelke (2004) suggested one system for individuating small
values (< 4) and another system for aggregating larger sets.
However, recent research (Hyde, 2011) suggests that the
difference in representation may be functional (i.e., due to
differences in strategy) rather than structural (i.e., separate
stores).
The process of aggregating appears to maintain
information about the statistical properties of sets. Previous
research on category learning provides evidence that
aggregating over individual objects results in a prototype, or
a most representative set member. Researchers have
suggested that the process of aggregating yields “a measure
of central tendency” (e.g., an average or prototypical
category member; Medin, Altom, & Murphy, 1984, p. 334).
Early research into prototypes suggested that when people
aggregate across multiple exemplars, they extract a
prototypical category member that represents an average of
category features (Medin et al., 1984; Nosofsky, Denton,
Zaki, Murphy-Knudsen, & Unverzagt, 2012). For example,
a robin is often seen as a prototypical bird because it shares
most of the features common among birds.
Numbers provide an intriguing extension of this work
because aggregation of sets may produce approximate

Introduction
Data interpretation (i.e., interpreting numbers in context) is
critical to everyday reasoning. Numbers are represented in
two ways, as an approximate magnitude and as a symbolic
value (Dehaene, 2009). Previous research suggests that
people compare single numbers as analog magnitudes,
meaning that numbers are represented as approximate rather
than exact values. Key evidence for this argument is that
comparisons are faster and more accurate as the ratio of
difference between values increases (Feigenson, Dehaene,
& Spelke, 2004; Hyde, 2011). Yet little is known about how
people represent numerical data sets. Previous research
involving the cognitive processing of number sets suggests
that people’s comparisons are highly related to the statistical
properties of the sets. Specifically, as the ratio of mean
differences between number sets increase and variance
within each set decreases, comparisons to assess which set
has the higher mean become faster and more accurate
(Masnick & Morris, 2008). These findings suggest that

measures of central tendency. Specifically, encoding a set of
numbers may implicitly provide information about the set
mean. The reviewed research suggests two related effects.
One, for small set sizes (< 4), participants will encode
individual set members. For larger set sizes (> 4),
participants will aggregate across values, losing information
about individual values. Two, the process of aggregating
values creates summary representations of the number sets,
including approximate mean and variance values.

Participants. Participants (N = 51) were undergraduate
students at a Midwestern state university. The average age
was 22.04 (SD = 6.84), 84% of the participants were female
and most were of Caucasian descent.
Procedure. Experiment 1 consisted of two counterbalanced
tasks: the number set task and a working memory task. All
participant tasks were presented using E-Prime software.
The number set task consisted of 126 trials. Each trial had
four parts, described here in order of presentation (see
Figure 1a).

Set Encoding and Working Memory
Working memory (WM) is often described as the
processes and mechanisms involved with the maintenance
of task relevant information necessary for performance of
cognitive tasks (Miyake & Shah, 1999). In the current study,
we predict that set representation is more likely to occur as
the number sets increase in size because maintenance of all
items from larger sets requires greater WM resources than
maintenance of items from smaller sets. Therefore, we also
predict that participants with larger WM capacity should be
able to maintain a greater number of items in WM and
correctly identify presented items.

Set Encoding and Metacognitive Monitoring
A secondary focus of this experiment was to investigate
the influence of metacognitive monitoring on the
representation of number sets. Monitoring refers to one’s
judgment of their current cognitive processing, specifically,
the degree to which a process is deliberate and a rough
estimate of one’s performance (Dunlosky & Metcalfe,
2009). We assessed monitoring through participant
confidence judgments.

Aims and Predictions
This experiment extends the work of Masnick and Morris
(2008) by examining how people represent and remember
number sets, and how accurately they judge their memory
for number sets. Independent variables were number set size
(4, 6, and 8) and coefficient of variation (20% and 10% of
mean). Dependent variables were number selection
accuracy, reaction time, confidence judgments, strategy use,
and working memory capacity. We predicted that people
would erroneously recall seeing set means or medians rather
than actual numbers from the sets as set sizes increased. As
suggested by Hyde (2011), different strategies are predicted
to be associated with encoding goals. Specifically, encoding
individual numbers is expected to be associated with longer
reaction times than encoding set aggregates, because the
latter is a relatively implicit process. Finally, we predicted
that number recall and mean identification would be related
to confidence judgments in terms of accuracy, or that they
would increase or decrease together.

Figure 1. Number set and working memory task procedures.
First, a fixation cross was presented to focus the
participant’s attention. Then, a number set was shown
(details of the sets and presentation durations below). Next,
two numbers were presented, an actual value from the set
and the mean or median value from the set. The participant
was asked to indicate which of the two numbers was in the
set presented in the previous slide by pressing a computer
key. The two numbers and indication prompt remained on
the screen until the participant chose an answer. After
responding, participants were asked how sure they were of
their answer. Confidence judgment response options were
presented as follows: 1) 0-25%, 2) 26-50%, 3) 51-75%, &
4) 76-100%. The response options and prompt remained on
the screen until the participant chose an answer.
There were four sets of stimuli, each preceded by a set of
instructions explaining the process outlined above to the
participant. The first six number sets were practice trials and
were not analyzed. Experimental trials included 40 sets of

Method

four numbers (each set presented for 2 s), 40 sets of six
numbers (each set presented for 2.5 s), and 40 sets of eight
numbers (each set presented for 3 s). Each set consisted of
three digit numbers. Within each set size, 10 sets were
drawn from one of four variance types. Set variance was
either 10% (low variance) or 20% (high variance) of the set
mean. For half of the choice trials, participants were shown
the set mean. For the remaining half, participants were
shown the set median; although for sets of 4 the mean and
median were identical.
The three blocks of experimental trials were presented
sequentially,
randomized
within-participants.
The
presentation location of the actual value and mean or
median value was also randomized so that the actual value
and mean were presented on the left or right side of the
screen in 50% of trials. After completing all number set
trials, participants were surveyed about their strategy use
during the task. Participants were presented nine strategy
descriptions (see Table 1) and were asked to estimate how
often they used each strategy during the experiment using
the following scale: 1) never, 2) some trials, 3) most trials,
or 4) always. The response options and prompt remained on
the screen until the participant chose an answer.

This pattern spanned four practice trials and a set of 24
stimuli, which was preceded by a set of instructions
explaining the process outlined above to the participant.
Feedback of “Correct!” or “Incorrect” was given for each
response. More detailed feedback was given during the
practice trials. Specially, if a correct answer was given it
was accompanied by a brief explanation of why that answer
was correct, but if an incorrect answer was given it was
accompanied by a more detailed explanation of how the
correct answer would have been attained. The block of 24
stimuli was randomized within-participants.

Results and Discussion
Participants were most accurate (M = .79, SD = .12) in
their responses for sets of four numbers. Accuracy (see
Figure 2) then declined as set size increased to six (M = .68,
SD = .10) and again when it increased to eight (M = .61, SD
= .08). Participants were also most confident (M = 3.05, SD
= .52) in their responses for sets of four numbers.
Confidence also declined as set size increased to six (M =
2.63, SD = .54) and again when it increased to eight (M =
2.43, SD = .63).

Reaction times (see Figure 3) for sets of four (M =
2269.37, SD = 585.34) were faster than for sets of six (M =
2338.76, SD = 620.24), but not faster than for sets of eight
(M = 2197.69, SD = 618.27).

Participants were also given the alphabet mathematics
working memory task (cf. Was, Rawson, Bailey, &
Dunlosky, 2011). The general format of this task was as
follows (see Figure 1b): the words “Get Ready” preceded a
letter or set of nonadjacent letters (presented for 2.5 s),
followed by a prompt containing a transformation direction
and number (ex. “Forward 2”). The participant then counted
forward or backward from the given letter or set of letters by
the number given. The transformation prompt remained on
the screen until the participant was ready to choose an
answer from a list of eight alternatives. Participants were
instructed to solve the problem before advancing to the
response alternative screen. Once a participant had
advanced to the response alternative screen, a time limit of 6
s was imposed to prevent one from solving the problem
while examining the alternatives in the response window.

Repeated measures ANOVA were used to analyze all
main variables. There was a significant decline in accuracy
as set size increased, F(2, 104) = 59.94, p = .000, η2 = .535.
More specifically, accuracy decreased significantly as set
size increased from 4 to 6, F(1, 52) = 39.62, p = .000, η2 =
.432, and as set size increased from 6 to 8, F(1, 52) = 20.98,
p = .000, η2 = .288.
There was a significant decrease in reaction times as set
size increased, F(2, 104) = 5.15, p = .007, η2 = .090. While
there was no significant difference in reaction time between
sets of 4 and sets of 6, F(1, 52) = 2.48, p = .121, η2 = .046,
there was a significant difference in reaction time between
sets of 6 and sets of 8, F(1, 52) = 11.38, p = .001, η2 = .180.
There was a significant decrease in confidence in one’s
answer as set size increased, F(2, 104) = 52.07, p = .000, η2
= .500. Contrasts showed significant decreases in
confidence as set size increased from 4 to 6, F(1, 52) =
55.80, p = .000, η2 = .518, and as set size increased from 6
to 8, F(1, 52) = 12.19, p = .001, η2 = .190. Zero-order
correlations indicated a positive relation between selection
accuracy and confidence judgment for set size of 4, r(52) =
.58, p = .000, and set size of 6, r(52) = .45, p = .001, but not
set size of 8, r(52) = .19, p = .173.
We compared the effect of high and low variance number
sets, aggregated across set size. A paired samples t-test
indicated that there was greater accuracy when variance in
the number set was higher (M = .72) than when it was lower
(M = .67), t(52) = 4.30, p = .000, d = 1.181. However, there
was no significant difference in reaction times between high
(M = 2301.25) and low (M = 2260.82) variance, t(50) =
1.39, p = .171, d = .393.
No correlations were found between working memory or
any of the variables of interest, so we performed a mean
split of the participants based on working memory task
performance and conducted independent samples t-tests to
compare the groups in terms of accuracy. There was no
significant differences between groups based on sets of 4,
t(51) = .46, d = .02, p =.65, or sets of 8, t(51) = .95, d = .02,
p = 35. However, the group scoring above the mean on the
WM task performed better than the group scoring below the
mean when set size was 6, t(51) = 2.08, d = .06, p = .04,
95% CI [.002, .114].
The most frequently used strategies were to “just get a
sense of the numbers” (M = 3.19, SD = .90) and to “try to
memorize specific numbers” (M = 2.87, SD = 1.01). These
data reflect the general pattern in recall accuracy, as
participants likely tried to memorize numbers from the sets
of 4, and then were forced to abandon that strategy in favor
of “just getting a sense of the numbers” as set sizes
exceeded four. This pattern supports the finding of Scholl
(2001) that people individuate items for sets smaller than
four. One of the least frequently used strategies was to “try
and figure out the average” (M = 1.26, SD = .62). This low
rating provides some evidence that the participants were not
consciously calculating the mean for the number sets. This
pattern is interesting because their response patterns indicate
that they chose the mean or median value of the set more

often than the actual value from the set as set size increased.
This pattern supports findings that people aggregate items
for sets larger than four (Scholl, 2001; Masnick & Morris,
2008).
The results demonstrate a clear effect of set size in that
participants were more likely to recall the actual value given
smaller set sizes (e.g., 4) than larger set sizes (e.g., 8). This
finding is consistent with findings using different types of
stimuli (e.g., dots) suggesting that encoding individual items
is the default operation until the number of items exceeds
working memory limits, demonstrated as four elements in
previous research (Ariely, 2001; Feigenson et al., 2004).
Once working memory limits are reached, the default
operation appears to be encoding the set as an aggregate.
The data also suggest that the process of aggregating
numbers yields as approximate mean. As set size increased,
participants were more likely to select the set mean rather
than the actual value as the number they had seen in the
experiment. Further, when the numbers varied less and were
within a smaller range, accuracy also decreased. It became
more difficult to distinguish set members from their mean
when the set members were more similar.
Working memory capacity also played a role in the ability
to identify presented values. When the sets presented
contained six items, individuals scoring above the mean on
the WM task out performed those scoring below the mean.
When the set size was four, WM capacity was not taxed for
either group, and when set size was eight, WM capacity was
likely exceeded for both groups.
In general, the confidence level of the participants fell
along with their performance, although the influence of
metacognitive monitoring on number recall was greater for
sets of 4 and sets of 6 than for sets of 8. The participants
showed accurate recognition that their performance was
declining as set size, and task difficulty, was increasing. The
lack of correlation between recall and confidence accuracy
for sets of 8 may be related to the pattern of strategy use, as
this set size would have been too large for one to memorize
the numbers presented, as well as large enough to pose
difficulty in trying to get a sense of the whole set.

Experiment 2
One possible limitation of Experiment 1 is that the task
explicitly asked participants to attend to and encode
individual values. Experiment 2 provided the same
experimental conditions but changed instructions to ask
participants to identify the set mean. This task parallels the
Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm (Deese,
1959; Roediger & McDermott, 1995), as participants will
study lists that are comprised of numbers (rather than
words) related to a non-presented response target (Sugrue &
Hayne, 2006). The change in instructions changes the task
demands and likely changes the strategy used for the task.
Specifically, if participants are asked to recall set means,
they will be less likely to encode individual values. Previous
research demonstrates that although people are relatively

355

accurate when estimating set means, estimation accuracy
decreases with set size (Peterson & Beach, 1967).

were asked to indicate which of the two numbers

which of the values was actually in the set).

Sets of 4

There was a significant decrease in reaction times as set
size increased, F(2, 52) = 11.01, p = .000, η2 = .298. There
was no significant difference in reaction time between sets
of 4 and sets of 6, F(1, 26) = 3.76, p = .063, η2 = .127, but
there was a significant decrease in reaction time between
sets of 6 and sets of 8, F(1, 26) = 13.98, p = .001, η2 = .350.
There was a significant decrease in confidence ratings
across set size, F(2, 52) = 22.44, p = .000, η2 = .463.
Contrasts showed significant decreases in confidence as set
size increased from 4 to 6, F(1, 26) = 18.52, p = .000, η2 =
.416, and as set size increased from 6 to 8, F(1, 26) = 8.55, p
= .007, η2 = .248. Zero-order correlations indicated no
relation between identification accuracy and confidence
judgment for set size of 4, r(27) = .07, p = .709, set size of
6, r(27) = -.07, p = .708, or set size of 8, r(27) = .33, p =
.087.
We compared high and low variance, aggregated across
set size. A paired samples t-test indicated that there was no
difference in accuracy when variance in the number set was
higher (M = .64) than when the variance was lower (M =
.64), t(26) = .184, p = .855, d = .072. However, there was a
significant difference in reaction times between high (M =
2543.05) and low (M = 2439.62) variance, t(26) = 2.24, p =
.034, d = .879.
No correlations were found between working memory or
any of the variables of interest, so we performed a mean
split of the participants based on working memory task
performance and conducted independent samples t-tests to
compare the groups in terms of accuracy. There was no
significant differences between groups based on sets of 4,
t(25) = -1.07, d = -.09, p = .29, on sets of 6, t(25) = -1.50, d
=.15, p =.146, or sets of 8, t(25) = -1.03, d = .31, p =.311.
The most frequently used strategies were to “just get a
sense of the numbers” (M = 2.85, SD = 1.02) and to “look at
the first digit” (M = 2.59, SD = .93). As with experiment
one, most participants tried to get a sense of each number
set. Predictably, fewer participants cited memorization (M =
2.33, SD = 1.07) as a frequently used strategy than those
from experiment one, as this would not have been necessary
due to the change in answer format. These data reflect the
general pattern in identification accuracy, as participant
performance stabilized once the sets grew larger than 4

Participants were most accurate (M = .71, SD = .19) in
their responses for sets of four numbers. Accuracy (see
Figure 4) then declined as set size increased to six (M = .62,
SD = .14) and again when it increased to eight (M = .58, SD
= .13). Participants were also most confident (M = 2.76, SD
= .64) in their responses for sets of four numbers.
Confidence also declined as set size increased to six (M =
2.37, SD = .66) and again when it increased to eight (M =
2.15, SD = .56).

numbers, the point at which one would expect participants
to have a better chance at inferring set characteristics rather
than trying to focus on memorizing individual numbers.
This pattern supports the finding that people individuate
items for sets smaller than four, but aggregate items for sets
larger than four (Scholl, 2001; Masnick & Morris, 2008).
These results reveal a similar pattern of behavior as in
Experiment 1, with a few exceptions. One exception was
that variance in set size did not affect accuracy in
identifying the mean in the same way it did identifying
members of the original set. Another exception is that
working memory did not appear to play a role in accuracy,
even in the largest sets, when identifying the mean. It is
possible that differences between a recognition task and a
slightly more inferential task are playing a role, but more
data with direct comparisons will be necessary to explore
this issue in more detail.

General Discussion
Our results provide new insights into how people represent
number sets. One, it appears that number sets and nonnumerical sets are aggregated similarly. Number sets of four
appear to be accurately encoded as individual values, likely
represented as symbolic values. Larger sets appear to be
encoded as aggregates and represented as analog
magnitudes. It appears that the process of aggregating over
sets results in an approximate mean. In Experiment 1, as set
size increased, participants were increasingly likely to
erroneously select the set mean, rather than the actual value
from the set. It appears that even with larger sets,
participants quickly approximated means, though less
accurately, than for smaller sets.
The results suggested that strategies are important in
creating different representations. One intriguing piece of
evidence from Experiment 1 is that reaction times for sets of
four and eight were shorter than for sets of six. This
suggests that participants might have been attempting to use
the same individuation strategy with sets of four and six. In
correspondence, we found a relation between working
memory capacity and performance only for those with high
capacities and only for sets of six items. This outcome was
not surprising, because the individuation strategy would be
more difficult for sets of six than for sets of four. This
suggestion is supported by a decline in accuracy and
confidence from sets of four to sets of six.
In conclusion, our results suggest that memory for
number sets is similar to memory for sets of objects in that
sets smaller that four are likely to be individuated while sets
larger than four are likely to be aggregated. The process of
aggregation
appears
to
maintain
approximate
representations of the statistical properties of the sets. One
possible explanation for the lack of relation between
working memory and recall accuracy found in this study is
that the tasks themselves load on spatial working memory,
rather than verbal memory (Morris & Masnick, 2008).
