Experiment 3
In the third experiment, we explored sound-symbolic
interpretations of tones in a tonal language (Mandarin
Chinese). In spite of the long tradition of phonetic and
phonological research into tone perception and use in tonal
languages, no experimental studies have laid an explicit link
between the Frequency Code and lexical tones (for a general
overview, see Lapolla, 1994).
Participants and Design
Ninety-six graduate and undergraduate Chinese students (39
male) from a university in Beijing participated in the study,
11 participants were excluded from the analysis due to
incomplete data caused by server problems. The study was
conducted in Mandarin Chinese and had a 2 x 4 design                Figure 1: Perception of Chinese lexical tones in novel brand
