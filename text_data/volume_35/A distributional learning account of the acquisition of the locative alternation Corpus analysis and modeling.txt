Correspondence analysis
The corpus analysis shows that children learn biased verb
classes in their first five years. We used correspondence
analysis (CA; Greenacre, 2007) to investigate whether
distributional regularities can support the development of
these classes. CA is a technique for clustering categorical
data in a low-dimensional space based on the similarity in
how elements co-occur.
   We performed a CA on adult utterances including
utterances that were not handcoded.            Similarity was
calculated based on the co-occurrence of each verb with the
two post-verbal words, however if a preposition (on, to,                       Figure 3. CA results for Factors 4 and 6.
