placebo when it comes to intractability (see also Kwisthout,
Wareham, & van Rooij, 2011; Kwisthout & van Rooij,
2013).
   We will close the tutorial with an interactive discussion
session about questions, issues, objections and philosophical
controversies regarding the demonstrated methodology
(e.g., such as also covered by van Rooij, 2008; van Rooij,
Wright, & Wareham, 2012). Participants will be encouraged
to bring in their own questions and points of discussion.
