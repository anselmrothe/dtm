used data from an open-interval experiment (Dougherty
& Harbison, 2007) to set an inter-retrieval time longer
than participants were found to search memory before
terminating search. However, the factors they identi-
fied as increasing the probability of search termination
would also slow down retrieval. That is, if intrusions in-
crease the probability of sampling non-target words, this
decreases the probability of sampling target list words.
When the probability of sampling a word decreases, the
expected time to sample that word increases. There-
fore, it might be that intrusions did not increase the
probability of search termination but simply slowed re-

of high and low frequency words (four of each). One
mixed-frequency list had a high frequency cue word per
block and one had a low frequency cue word. In both
experiments, word frequency did not have a significant
effect on the memory search termination variables.
Therefore, the analyses collapsed across lists of high
and low frequency words.
