   Creation of Artworks Each of the two artists created one
painting for each of the four pieces of piano music, for a
total of 8 paintings. On days that paintings were to be
created, each artist was provided with a single piece of
music and asked to reinterpret it as a painting, i.e., to paint
what the music would look like if it were a painting. They
were instructed to paint while listening to the music, and
encouraged to listen to it as many times as they wished
while they painted. They were allowed to use whatever
painting supplies they thought could most effectively
express the music (e.g., watercolors, oils, and acrylics were
all acceptable). They were instructed to complete their
paintings in one sitting without interruption. They were
instructed to take up to a maximum of 120 minutes to listen
to the music and complete the painting. The paintings were
created in the artists’ personal studios. In order to limit the
influence of the previous pieces of music on the new
painting, the artists were instructed not to re-listen to the
piece of music after the painting was finished, and there was
a gap of four days between each painting session.
