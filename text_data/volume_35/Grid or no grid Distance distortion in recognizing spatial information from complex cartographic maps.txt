Abstract

distortions have been shown to follow the principles of
perceptual grouping. For example, cities that are connected
by lines are found to be recalled as lying closer together
(Klippel, Knuf, Hommel & Freska, 2004; McNamara,
Ratcliff, & McKoon, 1984). Moreover, omissions and
additions that cannot be retrieved in the reality are present
(Mark et al., 1999). To examine the representation of
cognitive maps and distortions of real maps, previous
research has focused on subsets of cartographical tools.
Okabayashi and Glynn (1984), for instance, analyzed
straight and curved boundaries on simple white maps and
came to the conclusion that participants who studied the
curved boundary maps made more distortion errors than
those who studied the straight boundary maps and noboundary maps. Furthermore, Sadalla and Magel (1980)
showed that landmarks also distort the space around them.
The hierarchical organization of landmarks was examined
by Hirtle and Jonides (1985), who found a clustering of
landmarks on the basis of non-spatial attributes. Moreover,
they were able to point out that the clusters have
consequences for participants’ performance in distance
estimations. In addition, Hommel, Gehrke and Knuf (2000)
and Hurts (2005) showed a clustering due to boundaries or
rivers.
As introduced above, previous research mainly focused
on the examination of simple maps, and it still remains open
whether such distortions are also observed when using
higher complex cartographic material. Moreover, based on
cognitive principles, square grids are commonly used in
cartography as an artificial tool to guide a map reader´s
attention and to reduce spatial distortions, but this
hypotheses has not been tested empirically yet. Therefore,
the maps presented in this study were created at different
levels of visual complexity, varying in the amount of visual
details displayed at three dimensions: (1) territorial

Mental representations of environments are embodied in
cognitive maps. Cognitive maps enclose spatial and distance
distortions, which appear due to transcription errors based on
processing of map information. Participants processed
complex cartographical maps of varying amounts of visual
details like topography, boundaries and grid to examine their
effects on recall and orientation performance. The results
indicate that the presentation of boundaries, topographies and
a square grid significantly reduced distortion errors compared
to a blank map, whereas a presentation of more than one
visual element did not further reduce the distortions.

Introduction
A map, as a symbolic two-dimensional image of spatial
relations, is a complex display of different kinds of stimuli,
like object names, shapes, colors, spatial relationships and
distances (Thorndyke & Stasz, 1980). Orientation on a map,
thus, must be seen as a complex skill, which involves
encoding a broad set of verbal and spatial information as
well as combining and constructing a mental representation
of the visual stimulus. Furthermore, all information is given
simultaneously, which forces the map reader to evaluate and
process the information in procedures running parallel.
The mental representations of environments are embodied
in cognitive maps (Tversky, 1993). In a cognitive map,
elements are structured and can be mentally inspected
(Tversky, 1992). However, cognitive maps are not
miniaturized models of the reality, but rather a derivation of
the reality (Barkowsky, 2002). Examining the mental
representation of knowledge acquired from simple maps, it
can be shown that these representations are systematically
distorted affecting both the participants' recognition and
orientation performance (McNamara, 1986). Such

information (e.g., mountains), (3) grid: no grid vs. overlaid
square grid. The goal is to evaluate the orientation and
memory performance when participants learn the location of
unknown cities at the different types of cartographic maps.

into Adobe® Flash® CS5. Here, based on the objectoriented language ActionScript 3.0, the maps were
imbedded into an animated application used to execute the
computer-based trial.

Participants
Sixty-two participants (30 male, 32 female) aged between
19 to 34 years [M = 23,1; SD = 3,4] participated voluntarily
in the study. All participants gave written informed consent
before inclusion in the study.

Materials
Eight different maps (680 px x 510 px) were created as
study material. The first map was a blank white map, the
second map included a network of red boundaries and the
third included a colored topography. The fourth map
comprised both the topography and boundary lines. Maps
5-8 copied these maps but additionally were overlaid by an
artificial square grid (170 px x 170 px) (see Figure 1). The
other design parameters of the grid, such as the color and
width of the grid line, are based on the map grids standardly
used in printed German topographic maps (scale 1:25,000).
In addition, a pool of 28 newly created city names of eightletter-length was established. Based on this pool, seven
cities were pseudorandomly overlaid on each of these maps
illustrated as red dots (so that no city was presented twice
for any participant).

paradigm. Maps 2, 6, 4 and 8 include boundary lines. Maps
3, 7, 4 and 8 include a colored topography. Maps in the
second row are overlaid by an artificial square grid.

Statistics
The orientation and memory performance was assessed by
measuring the distance between the recalled place location
compared to the original location of the city from the studyphase map. The Euclidian distance was measured in pixels.
A city was rated correct in case the recalled location fell
within a distance smaller than 28,4 px (= 1cm) from the
study location (Okabayashi & Glynn, 1984). A mixed threeway 2*2*2 ANOVA comprising the within-subjects factors
boundaries and topography and the between-subjects factor
grid was computed for the number of correctly recalled
cities and the mean distances of correctly positioned cities
within the 1cm radius at a given significance threshold of
p = .05.

Design
The study consisted of a three-factorial 2*2*2 mixed design
comprising the within-subjects factors boundaries and
topography, and the between-subjects factor grid (see Figure
1). Participants were randomly divided into two groups.
Both groups received the same maps with the same
arrangement of cities, boundaries and topography, but one
group with an overlaid square grid and the other without.
All participants were told to study the seven cities on each
map. For each city they had to remember the localization on
the map as well as the name.
Each trial began with a study phase of two minutes, which
was followed by a two minute interval with filler tasks.
After the interval participants had to recall the seven cities
on the same map, which now only included the background
but not the red dotted cities. Participants were instructed to
complete the task as accurate and as fast as possible by
placing the cities on the map, using the cursor. After the
placement of each city, participants had to type in the cityname. The trial was confined to three minutes. Furthermore,
the presentation order of the different map types was
randomized for each participant. The cartographic
visualization of the maps was made with Adobe®

Results
The repeated measures ANOVA for mean distances of
correct placements with grid versus no-grid as a between
subject factor revealed a significant main effect of grid
[F(1,60) = 6.359, p = .014, ηp2 = .096], but no significant
main effects of topography (p = .69) and boundaries (p =
.21). Moreover, a significant interaction between
topography and grid was observed [F(1,60) = 6.464, p =
.014, ηp2 = .097]. Post-hoc t-tests showed that distances
significantly decreased with the presentation of grids when
no topography was present [t(122) = 3.631, p < .
001].Distances for maps without topography and without
grids are higher compared to those with topography and
either without or with grids [t(122) = 2.069, p < .043; t(122)
= 2.287, p < .024] whereas the presentation of the grid has

The ANOVA on distances also revealed a significant
interaction between boundaries and grid [F(1,60) = 5.821,
p = .019, ηp2 = .088]. The results of the post-hoc t-tests
indicate that distances significantly decrease with the
presentation of grids when no boundary is present [t(122) =
3.676, p < .001] and distances are higher compared to maps
with boundaries and either without or with grids [t(63) =
2.471, p < .016; t(122) = 2.874, p < .005], whereas the
presentation of the grid has no effect when boundaries are
present (p = .560) (Figure 3). The interactions between
topography and boundary (p = .40) and between grid,
topography and boundary (p = .21) were not significant (for
means and standard deviations see Table 1).

and topography [F(1,60) = 10.762, p = .002, ηp2 = .152], and
between grid, topography and boundary[F(1,60) = 10.245,
p = .002, ηp2 = .146] were observed. Although the
presentation of a grid did not show any effect if a
topography was present, the recall of city-locations was
significantly better among maps without topography if a
grid was present [F(1,60) = 8.717 p = .004, ηp2 = .127]
(Table 2). The interactions between grid and boundaries
(p = .17), and between topography and boundaries (p = .44)
were not significant (for means and standard deviations see
Table 2).

Discussion
The inclusion of visual boundaries, topographic information
and of a square grid significantly modulate distance
distortions and recall performance of complex cartographic
maps, probably due to altered cognitive representations of
the spatial relations. Following the analysis of the distance

The repeated measures ANOVA for mean percentages of
correctly recalled cities with grid versus no-grid as a
between subject factor revealed a significant main effect of
topography [F(1,60) = 4.976, p = .029, ηp2 = .077]. No other
main effect reached significance (grid, p = .12; boundaries,

distortions a clear picture emerges in that adding of visual
elements significantly reduces distances relative to the
original locations. Of particular note is that no further
additive effects of these visual elements were observed. For
example, no further advantage of boundaries or the
displayed topography is visible in orientation performance
when a square grid is already present – but also no
disadvantage. Participants seem to set different additional
visual information apart from an other to enhance their
orientation performance and thus to reduce distortions
(Figures 2 and 3), but the transfer to combination of visual
information is missing.
In general these result support the notion of structured
cognitive maps derived from environmental (visual)
information – as the present paradigm rules out effects of
previous knowledge (Barkowsky, 2002; Tversky, 1992). A
likely way to use such complex visual information is to
build visual hierarchies (Eastman, 1985; Hirtle & Jonides,
1985) forming frames of representation that clusters the
visual elements. Thus, cartographic details seem, in
accordance with our initial hypothesis to guide the processes
of cognitive map formation. It will be a question of future
research to examine why no additive effects of the visual
elements were visible, a first hypothesis would need to
consider a kind of visual overkill, which if it can be
replicated would affect the designing of cartographic
material.
Regarding the recall performance of cities, topography
had an overall effect, whereas grids again only improved the
orientation on simple maps. This matches the results of the
distance distortion analyses. Future studies should include
different grid types to examine this result and to improve the
use of grids, but also the presentation of topographic details
and boundary information as assistant cartographic
elements. Topographic details and boundaries should be
modified in density and spacing to receive an impression of
the degree in which the adding of visual elements effects
distance distortion. Additionally, different grid types in
combination with the assistant cartographic elements
should be analyzed in terms of a coordination of
cartographic elements to support the map reader.
Furthermore, general investigations in navigation
performances should be pursued based on these results.
