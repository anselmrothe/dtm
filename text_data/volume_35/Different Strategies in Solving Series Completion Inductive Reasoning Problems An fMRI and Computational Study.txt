network plays an important role in inductive reasoning, the
retrieval and imaginal module are of special interest in the
present study, in the following, we would illustrate the
prediction of BOLD responses in the two modules.
   The fit of the predictions of the model to the RT and ACC
data are presented in Figure 3. The parameters were
estimated to fit the behavioral data: a factor that scaled the
time to retrieve a declarative memory fact (0.3 sec) and the
time to modify the contents of the imaginal module (i.e., 0.2
sec). This leads to a predicted effect size (605.42 ms for
NumIR, 2116.17 ms for LetIR, 551.25 ms for baseline
conditions) that is highly similar to the observed effect size
(586.4 ms for NumIR, 2221.4 ms for LetIR, 530.4 ms for
Is10, and 606.1 ms for IsJ). Only the deviation of data is
presented because the model makes identical predictions. It
can be seen that the model produced a reasonable fit to the
behavioral data.
   In order to generate BOLD predictions, we convolved the
module activity with a gamma function. As is typical (e.g.,
Boyton et al., 1996; Glover, 1999), if the module is engaged,
it will produce a BOLD response t time units later according
to the function:
                 𝐻 𝑡 = 𝑚(𝑡/𝑠)𝛼 𝑒 −(𝑡/𝑠)
The parameter m is the magnitude parameter and determines
the height of the function; the parameter s is the scale
parameter and determines the time scale, and the parameter
is the shape parameter and determines the narrowness of the
function. The cumulative BOLD responses in a particular
module is the sum of the individual BOLD responses driven
