Time Considered as a Helix of Precious Words:
  Modeling the Emergence and Interactions of
                 Word Learning Biases
Author: Eliana Colunga
Abstract: Early word learning may be supported by a
developmental feedback loop: the kind of words a child
learns early on support the generalization of attentional
biases, which in turn guides subsequent word learning. In a
series of neural network simulations and a longitudinal
behavioral study with toddlers in the lab, we explore the
interactions between words learned and word learning
biases, and argue that it is this interaction that builds the
individual developmental trajectories children follow. First,
we look at the development of the shape bias for solids and
how its emergence is accompanied by an attentional shift in
novel noun generalizations for other solidities, in both
networks and toddlers. Second, we look at how the
