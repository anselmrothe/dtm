using SV constructions may convey that all the agents play
the same role in the event. Such pragmatic needs may guide
people to prefer to use SVO constructions to describe
causative events, and SV constructions for non-causative
events, even though SV constructions do not always
correspond to causative events in the Chinese input.
   In sum, the present research has shown that although
Chinese adults prefer to use SVO and SV constructions to
describe causative and non-causative events, respectively,
they do not always use this knowledge of syntax-semantics
correspondences in deciding whether a given sentence refers
to a causative or a non-causative event. The latter result
suggests that the particular property of Chinese that allows
argument-dropping might guide Chinese speakers not to
automatically map an SV sentence to a non-causative event.
However, despite this property of the Chinese language,
why do Chinese speakers prefer to use SV and SVO
constructions to describe non-causative and causative events,
respectively? Is this because the knowledge of syntax-
semantics correspondences is universal, as suggested by
