consequence of frequency alone. The static similarity model
also uses a single probe: semantic similarity. This assumes
that individuals rely only on the previously recalled item as
a probe for the next recall, producing a chain of pairwise
associated animals. The static combined model represents
the simultaneous combination of frequency and semantic
similarity. This assumes a process based on semantic
similarity to the previous item that is further informed by
the frequency of past experience with those items.
   The dynamic model switches between a frequency probe
and a probe that combines frequency and similarity to
traverse clusters of similar items in memory. When leaving
a cluster, a dynamic model uses frequency alone to find a
new cluster, and goes back to using a simultaneous
combination of frequency and similarity information as the
new cluster is entered. Transitions are predicted by the
model only after they occur, meaning that the model tests           Figure 1: Mean number of correct responses produced in

How do healthy aging and dementia impact
memory search?
The number of switches per item was essentially unrelated
to the total number of items recalled (t(422) = -1.21, p = .22,
r = -.06). Additionally, it was also not related with age
(t(422) = -1.05, p = .29, r = -.05), or with the presence of
dementia (t(422) = .87, p = .38, rpb = .04). Contrary to the
cluster-switching and the cue-maintenance hypotheses, both
of which posit specific changes in switching with increased
age, these results seem to suggest that there are no
differences in the nature of probe utilization with increased
age, in support of the age invariance hypothesis. This result
