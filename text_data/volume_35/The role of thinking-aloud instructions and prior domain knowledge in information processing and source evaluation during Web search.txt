Abstract

about information quality (i.e., the accuracy, authority,
objectivity, or currency of information; e.g. Rieh, 2002;
Tombros, Ruthven, & Jose, 2005). According to Tombros et
al. (2005) also the structure of Web pages (i.e., the clarity of
the Web page or the organization of the information therein)
is evaluated extensively.
The aim of the present paper was to identify potential
reasons for the divergent findings. Specifically, we
examined the impact of the instructions used in the studies
as well as of participants' prior domain knowledge on
information processing and source evaluation during Web
search, using a rich multi-method approach including eye
tracking methodologies, log file data, and verbal protocols.

This paper examines the impact of thinking-aloud (TA)
instructions as well as of individuals' prior domain knowledge
on information processing and source evaluation during Web
search on a health-related topic. With regard to TA
instructions, prompted instructions that entailed evaluation
prompts (as used in some previous Web search studies) were
compared to neutral instructions (in line with the standards
defined by Ericsson & Simon, 1993) and to a silent condition.
To measure participants' (N = 44) information processing and
source evaluation we used a rich multi-method approach
including eye-tracking methodologies, log file data, and
verbal protocols. Results indicate that prompted TA
instructions as compared to neutral instructions significantly
increased participants' verbal reflections on information
quality and on structural aspects of Web pages, given that
participants possessed at least a moderate level of prior
domain knowledge. In addition, prompted instructions
resulted in less linear viewing sequences on the search engine
results pages than the silent condition. Finally, the higher
participants' prior domain knowledge the more intensely they
scrutinized the search results presented by the search engine
and the smaller were their average pupil sizes, which
indicated lower cognitive load. The significance of the results
is considered in light of methodological as well as educational
implications.

The Role of Prompted Thinking-Aloud Instructions
One reason for the divergent findings might be a
methodological one, namely that in the studies by Rieh
(2002) and Tombros et al. (2005) participants were
instructed beforehand to explain what criteria they used to
evaluate Web information (Tombros et al., 2005) or to select
good or credible information during Web search and to
explain their evaluation processes in the form of postsearch
interviews including specific evaluation-related questions
(Rieh, 2002).
According to the seminal work by Ericsson and Simon
(1993) and the meta-analysis by Fox, Ericsson, and Best
(2011), however, procedures for verbal reporting are only
nonreactive (i.e., do not alter thought processes and task
performance) when instructions to think aloud are given in a
neutral way, by instructing participants to verbalize their
thoughts per se. In contrast, procedures that entail
describing or explaining thoughts and actions – as it was the
case in the studies by Tombros et al. (2005) and Rieh (2002)
– are significantly reactive, altering participants' course of
cognitive processing and leading to higher task performance
than silent conditions. Hence, the instructions used by
Tombros et al. (2005) and Rieh (2002) might have increased
participants’ awareness of the necessity of critically
evaluating the information retrieved during Web search.
Indirect evidence for this assumption comes from the
studies by Hargittai et al. (2010) and Savolainen and Kari
(2006) that used neutral thinking-aloud (TA) instructions
and only found few utterances related to information quality
or structural aspects of Web pages. A first aim of the present
study, thus, was to further prove this assumption by directly
comparing participants' verbal utterances when given TA

Introduction
In recent years, the World Wide Web (WWW) has evolved
into a major information resource offering easy access to
billions of Web pages on almost any topic. However, as
anyone can publish virtually any information on the WWW,
the quality of Web pages can vary widely. That is,
misleading and low-quality Web pages, for example, in the
field of medicine and health care, are as common as those
providing neutral, high-quality information. Hence, to avoid
the selection and use of doubtful or even false information,
it is important that Web users themselves critically evaluate
the quality of information they retrieve from the Web.
Previous empirical findings about Web users' source
evaluation as indicated by verbal reports, however, are
inconclusive. Whereas some studies indicate that Web users
mainly evaluate search results and Web pages only based on
the topical relevance or their ranking in the search engine
results page (e.g., Hargittai, Fullerton, Menchen-Trevino, &
Thomas, 2010; Savolainen & Kari, 2006), others suggest
that Web users are also concerned to a substantial extent

instructions entailing explicit prompts to explain what
criteria they used to evaluate search results and Web pages
(hereinafter referred to as prompted thinking-aloud) with
neutral TA instructions (in line with Ericsson & Simon,
1993).
Furthermore, previous research that directly compared
participants' information processing while thinking-aloud
(with neutral or prompted instructions) to a silent condition,
showed that with prompted TA instructions that entailed
explanation prompts participants who had to solve a series
of information tasks on a Website explored the information
more extensively than when they worked in silence
(Hertzum, Hansen, & Andersen, 2009). That is, in the
former case participants showed a more distributed visual
exploration of the screen (i.e., they searched or scanned
more across the screen), scrolled more frequently within
Web pages, and navigated to more Web pages than in the
silent condition. Between the neutral TA instructions and
the silent condition, in contrast, only few marginal
differences were found. With the present study we aimed at
expanding these findings to a Web search scenario including
multiple Websites being accessed via a search engine results
page (SERP), with participants either receiving prompted
TA instructions (including evaluation prompts), neutral TA
instructions, or working in silence.

undifferentiated or lacking trustworthiness evaluations of
low-knowledge readers is that they have to invest more
cognitive effort in comprehending the content of the
documents than readers with higher domain knowledge. As
a consequence, low-knowledge readers might have less
cognitive resources available to engage in evaluations that
go beyond content. Thus, another central aim of our study
was to further examine the effects of prior domain
knowledge on information processing and source evaluation
during Web search as well as potential interactions between
prior domain knowledge and TA instructions.

Hypotheses of the Present Study
Given the theoretical considerations and prior empirical
findings our hypotheses were as follows:
First, with respect to the evaluation of information quality
and structural aspects of Web pages as indicated by verbal
utterances, we hypothesized that prompted TA instructions
would increase the number of respective verbal utterances
during Web search as compared to neutral instructions, but
only when participants' possessed a certain level of prior
knowledge (cf. Metzger, 2007) (H1). Low-knowledge
participants' quality-related and structure-related verbal
utterances should not be increased due to participants' lack
of cognitive resources (cf. Bråten et al., 2011).
Second, based on the findings by Hertzum et al. (2009)
we hypothesized that prompted TA instructions as compared
to a silent condition would result in a more distributed
scanning behavior on SERPs (H2) and a significant increase
in Web pages selected from the SERPs during Web search
(H3). In contrast, neutral instructions should only result in
slight changes in regard to these measures as compared to a
silent condition.
Third, according to the case-study results of MaKinster et
al. (2002) we hypothesized that the higher participants'
domain knowledge the more thoroughly they would
scrutinize the search results, as indicated by longer total
fixation times (H4). Finally, based on the theoretical
assumption provided by Bråten et al. (2011) we
hypothesized that the lower participants' domain knowledge,
the more cognitively demanding the Web search would be
for them, which should result in larger mean pupil sizes
(H5) which is known to be an indicator of increased
cognitive load (for review e.g. see Hyönä, Tommola, &
Alaja, 1995; Wang, 2010).

The Role of Prior Domain Knowledge
Referring to the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM; Petty
& Cacioppo, 1986) from persuasion research, Metzger
(2007) postulates that the extent to which Web users engage
in source evaluations is dependent both on their motivation
(which might be increased by evaluation prompts), but also
on their ability (e.g. their prior domain knowledge). In this
regard it should be noted that participants in Rieh's (2002)
study reported to use their prior domain knowledge to
evaluate information quality, indicating that they possessed
a certain amount of prior knowledge on the search topics.
Importantly, previous research has not only shown
differences in source evaluations between domain experts
and novices, but also between groups of novices varying in
their level of prior domain knowledge. For example, a casestudy by MaKinster, Beghetto, and Plucker (2002) that
investigated undergraduate students' Web search on a
complex science topic through postsearch interviews that
entailed evaluation-related questions indicated that students
with moderate domain knowledge scrutinized search results
more thoroughly, by examining the titles, the page excerpts,
and the URLs of the search results, than low-knowledge
students. In addition, Bråten, Strømsø, and Salmerón (2011)
found that when reading multiple documents dealing with a
science-related topic undergraduates with low knowledge on
the subject matter trusted the different documents to the
same extent irrespective of the type of source, whereas
students with higher knowledge judged an article from a
company with vested interests about the addressed issue as
less trustworthy than the other documents. According to
Bråten et al. (2011) a possible explanation for the

Method
Participants and Design

Participants 1 were 44 undergraduates (18 male, M = 25.02
years, SD = 3.68) from different majors at a large German

Note that parts of the empirical research reported in this paper
have been published in Gerjets, Kammerer, and Werner (2011)
who compared the two thinking-aloud groups (irrespective of prior
knowledge). The data of the silent group were gathered at the same
time as the data of the two thinking-aloud groups.

university, who were rewarded with either course credit or
payment. Participants had normal or corrected to normal
vision. They reported to use Google as their primary search
engine and judged their computer- and Web search
experience and skills between intermediate and high (M =
3.50, SD = 0.67, 4 items, on a scale from 1 = very low to 5 =
very high, Cronbach’s α = .78).
Thinking-aloud condition served as a between-subjects
factor, with participants being randomly assigned to a
neutral TA condition, a prompted TA condition, or a silent
condition. Neutral instructions to think aloud were worded
in line with the standards described by Ericsson and Simon
(1993), that is "Please think aloud during your Web search,
that is, verbalize everything that comes to your mind." In
contrast, the prompted TA instructions were similar to the
instructions used, for instance, by Tombros et al. (2005) or
Rieh (2002) including evaluation prompts, that is "Please
think aloud during your Web search, that is, mention the
evaluation criteria you apply to select search results and to
assess Web pages." In the silent condition participants
performed the task silently.
There were no differences between the three conditions
regarding participants’ age (χ2(2, N = 44) = 2.24, p = .33),
gender (F < 1), or computer- and Web search experience
and skills (F < 1).
As a second factor participants’ self-reported prior
knowledge on the subject matter of the task (i.e., diets and
nutrition) was assessed (see 'Measures' for details) and used
as a continuous between-subjects factor.

know more about diets and nutrition than my family and
friends” or "I can describe the concept of low carb diets".
Cronbach’s alpha was .87 for the eight items. The range of
participants’ prior domain knowledge was 1 to 4.38 (M =
2.48, SD = 0.70). There were no differences between the
three experimental conditions regarding participants’ prior
knowledge on diets and nutrition (F < 1).
Dependent variables
Participants' thinking-aloud protocols (in the prompted and
neutral TA conditions) were segmented at a small grain size:
Each sentence or utterance preceded and followed by a
pause was considered a separate segment. According to the
studies by Rieh (2002) and Tombros et al. (2005) utterances
were coded as information quality when participants on
SERPs or Websites reflected on whether (or not) the
information is good, valid, credible, or current, or the source
provides trustworthy, reliable, or official information, and as
structure of Web pages when participants addressed the
clarity of a Web page or the organization of the information
therein (cf. Tombros et al., 2005). Besides, utterances
addressing the topical relevance (i.e., utterances on SERPs
or Websites about whether or not the information matches
with the search topic) were coded (e.g., Savolainen & Kari,
2006). Two raters familiar with the search task and the Web
materials scored 30% of the protocols. Interrater reliability
computed on this subsample of protocols yielded a Cohen’s
kappa of .76. Disagreements were resolved through
discussion between the raters. One rater scored the
remaining protocols.
In addition, for participants of all three conditions their
viewing and selection behavior on the SERPs were
analyzed. Eye movements and mouse clicks were recorded
by a 50 Hz Tobii 1750 remote eye-tracking system
supported by the software ClearView 2.7.1.
To analyze participants' eye-tracking data, for each of the
ten search results on a SERP a polygonal area of interest
(AOI) was defined around the search result (covering the
title, the excerpt, and the URL), in order to determine for
how long and in which order a participant was looking at a
search result. The minimum fixation duration was set to 100
milliseconds with a fixation radius of 30 pixels. On this
basis, the total fixation time of each search result, that is,
the overall amount of time participants scrutinized a search
result to decide whether to click on it or not, was calculated.
Second, as a measure of distributed viewing behavior across
the screen (cf. Hertzum et al., 2009) participants' viewing
sequences on the SERPs, that is, the order in which the
search results on a SERP were inspected, were computed,
by comparing them with a perfectly linear sequence from
top to bottom (search result 1, search result 2, search result
3, search result 4, etc.) by means of the Levenshtein distance
(cf. Josephson & Holmes 2002). Levenshtein distance
values were transformed into a similarity percentage: A
higher similarity percentage indicated more linear top-tobottom viewing sequences. The similarity percentages were
averaged across the three SERPs. Third, participants' mean

Tasks and Web Materials
Participants were given the task of seeking information on
the WWW about two competing weight loss methods,
namely low carb(ohydrate) diets and low fat diets, in order
to give informed advice to a fictitious overweight friend
who wants to lose weight by changing her diet.
To complete the experimental task, which was limited to
20 minutes, participants were provided with three
prefabricated Google-like SERPs (with ten search results
each), retrieved for the search terms “low fat”, “low carb”,
and “low carb versus low fat”. Participants were instructed
to access all three SERPs during their Web search. They
could access all 30 Websites corresponding to the list of
search results presented on the SERPs, but were not allowed
to generate new search results by changing the search terms.
All search results and Websites were relevant to the search
topic in regard to the content of information provided, but
differed with regard to the type of sources including
Websites provided by scientific institutions, journalists,
industry and companies, and laypeople.

Measures
Self-reported prior domain knowledge To assess
participants’ prior knowledge on diets and nutrition,
participants were administered a questionnaire with eight
statements that had to be rated on five-point scales
(1=totally disagree; 5=totally agree); example items are “I

pupil size (in mm) during task processing was computed
(averaged across eyes).
Furthermore, based on the mouse click recordings, the
number of Websites participants' accessed during their Web
search was analyzed (cf. Hertzum et al., 2009).

SD above the sample mean) and moderate-knowledge
participants (i.e., at the sample mean) expressed more
information-quality utterances during prompted TA than
during neutral TA (β = .80, t(25) = 3.85, p = .001 and β =
.48, t(25) = 3.31, p = .003, respectively). In contrast, lowknowledge participants (i.e., 1 SD below the sample mean)
did not significantly differ in the two TA conditions (β =
.16, t(25) = 0.79, p = .44). In addition, in the prompted TA
condition prior knowledge was significantly positively
related to the number of information-quality utterances (β =
.67, t(25) = 3.30, p = .001), whereas in the neutral TA
condition it wasn't (β = .05, t(25) = 0.24, p = .81).
With respect to verbal utterances regarding the structure
of Web pages the ANCOVA showed similar effects: a
significant effect of TA condition (F(1, 25) = 13.69, p =
.001, ηp2 = .35), a marginal effect of prior knowledge (F(1,
25) = 3.49, p = .07, ηp2 = .12), and a significant interaction
between the two factors (F(1, 25) = 6.01, p = .02, ηp2 = .19).
Simple comparisons revealed that only high-knowledge
participants and moderate-knowledge participants expressed
more structure-related utterances during prompted TA than
during neutral TA (β = .89, t(25) = 4.34, p < .001 and β =
.53, t(25) = 3.70, p = .001, respectively). In contrast, lowknowledge participants did not differ in the two TA
conditions (β = .17, t(25) = 0.85, p = .41). In addition, as for
the information-quality utterances, in the prompted TA
condition prior knowledge was significantly positively
related to the number of structure-related utterances (β =
.62, t(25) = 3.07, p = .01), whereas in the neutral condition it
wasn't (β = -.08, t(25) = -0.41, p = .69).

Procedure
Participants were tested in individual sessions of
approximately one hour. The lighting conditions were kept
constant during all examinations. Before participants started
on the search task, control variables and self-reported prior
domain knowledge were assessed. Furthermore, participants
received some general instructions about the Web search
experiment as well as the TA instructions according to their
experimental condition. Next, they performed a practice task
(structured in the same way as the subsequent main task) for
approximately five minutes to get acquainted with the Web
search environment and with the TA method. After the
practice task, participants received the instruction for the
main task (i.e., the request of the fictitious friend). Then,
they were calibrated on the eye-tracking system using a
nine-point calibration and started their Web search. In the
two TA conditions, whenever participants stopped
verbalizing their thoughts, the experimenter reminded them
(after 5 seconds) to keep thinking aloud or to mention the
evaluation criteria, respectively. After 20 minutes
participants were asked to stop the task. Subsequent to their
Web search, they had to decide which of the two weight loss
methods they would recommend. However, in the present
study only process measures during Web search were
analyzed.

Eye-Tracking and Mouse Clicks

Results

With regard to the linearity of participants’ viewing
sequences on the SERPs, as measured by the similarity
percentages of participants’ string to a linear top-to-bottom
string, the ANCOVA showed a significant main effect of
TA condition (F(2, 38) = 6.19, p = .01, ηp2 = .25).
Bonferroni post-hoc tests revealed that in line with the
predictions of H2, in the prompted TA condition
participants' viewing sequences were significantly less
linear than in the silent condition (p = .004). The differences
between the neutral TA condition and the silent condition
were only marginally significant (p = .08). The two TA
conditions did not differ significantly (p = .89). Prior
knowledge had no effect on participants' viewing sequences
and there was no interaction with TA conditions (both Fs <
1).
Regarding the total fixation time of each search result the
ANCOVA showed a significant main effect of prior
knowledge (F(1, 38) = 4.00, p = .05, ηp2 = .10). In line with
the predictions by H4, the higher participants' domain
knowledge, the more intensely they scrutinized the search
results to decide whether or not to click on them. TA
conditions had no effect (F < 1) and there was no interaction
with prior knowledge (F(1, 38)= 1.52, p = .23).

ANCOVAs with TA conditions (neutral, prompted, and
silent) and prior domain knowledge (z-scored) as well as an
interaction term between TA conditions and prior domain
knowledge were conducted. Significant interaction effects
between TA condition and prior domain knowledge were
probed according to the procedure outlined by Aiken and
West (1991). Table 1 shows means and standard errors for
the dependent variables.

Verbal Utterances
With respect to verbal utterances about topical relevance
neither TA condition nor prior domain knowledge had a
significant effect and there was no significant interaction
between the two factors (all Fs < 1.90, ps > .18).
With respect to verbal utterances about information
quality the ANCOVA showed a significant effect of TA
condition (F(1, 25) = 10.95, p = .003, ηp2 = .30) and of prior
knowledge (F(1, 25) = 6.22, p = .02, ηp2 = .20). These
effects were qualified by a significant interaction between
the two factors (F(1, 25) = 4.62, p = .04, ηp2 = .16). Simple
comparisons according to the procedure outlined by Aiken
and West (1991) revealed that, consistent with the
predictions of H1, only high-knowledge participants (i.e., 1

With regard to participants' mean pupil size during task
processing, after controlling for participant's average eye-toscreen-distance (which had a strong positive effect on pupil
size, F(1, 37) = 7.89, p = .01, ηp2 = .18), the ANCOVA
showed a significant effect of prior knowledge (F(1, 37) =
5.87, p = .02, ηp2 = .14). In line with the predictions by H5,
less prior domain knowledge was associated with larger
pupil sizes. Besides, there was no significant effect of TA
conditions (F(2, 37) = 1.71, p = .20), nor a significant
interaction with prior knowledge (F < 1 ).
With regard to the number of Websites participants
accessed during Web search, the ANCOVA showed no
significant main effect of TA conditions (F(1, 38) = 1.51, p
= .24), but of prior knowledge (F(1, 38) = 5.40, p = .03, ηp2
= .12). This effect was qualified by a significant interaction
with TA conditions (F(2, 38) = 7.11, p = .002, ηp2 = .27).
Simple comparisons revealed that participants with high
prior knowledge accessed significantly more Websites in the
prompted TA condition than in the silent or neutral TA
condition (β = .45, t(38) = 2.26, p = .03 and β = .53, t(38) =
2.32, p = .03, respectively), which did not differ
significantly (β = .09, t(38) = 0.42, p = .68). Thus, the
assumptions of H3 are at least partly confirmed. However,
other than expected, low-knowledge participants accessed
significantly more Websites in the neutral TA condition
than in the silent or prompted TA condition (β = .51, t(38) =
2.41, p = .02 and β = .72, t(38) = 3.65, p = .001,
respectively), which did not differ significantly (β = .21,
t(38) = 0.97, p = .34).
In addition, in the prompted TA condition prior
knowledge was significantly positively related to the
number of selected search results (β = .93, t(38) = 4.13, p <
.001), whereas in the silent and neutral TA condition no
significant relationship with prior knowledge were found (β
= -.38, t(38) = -1.66, p = .11 and β = .25, t(38) = 1.17, p =

First, with regard to verbal utterances about information
quality and the structure of Web pages, in line with H1, our
study showed that prompted TA instructions (i.e., to
mention the evaluation criteria applied to select search
results and to assess Web pages) as compared to neutral TA
instructions (i.e., to verbalize everything that comes to their
mind) significantly increased participants' verbal reflections
on information quality and on structural aspects of Web
pages, given that participants possessed at least a moderate
level of prior knowledge on diets and nutrition. In contrast,
irrespective of the instructions given, students with no or
little prior domain knowledge only rarely expressed such
utterances. Thus, to conclude, the findings by Rieh (2002)
and Tombros et al. (2005) seem to have resulted from a
combination of prompted TA instructions and a certain level
of prior domain knowledge of the participants. Utterances
about topical relevance, on the contrary were expressed by
all participants to a similar extent, irrespective of prior
knowledge or instructions. That is, the evaluation of
whether or not a search result or a Web page addresses the
search topic seems to be a default process that guides every
Web search task.
Second, with regard to the effects of prompted or neutral
TA instructions on participants' information processing
during Web search as compared to a silent condition, in line
with H2 and the findings by Hertzum et al. (2009) about
Web page inspection, we found that the prompted
instructions resulted in less linear, that is, more distributed
viewing sequences on the SERPs. That is, instead of simply
following the list order (a typical effect on SERPs)
participants examined the search results in a rather free way.
This can be seen as an indication of own evaluations,
instead of simply relying on the order presented by the
search engine. Between the neutral TA instructions and the
silent condition, in contrast, only marginal respective
differences were found (cf. Hertzum et al., 2009). With
regard to the number of Websites accessed during Web
search the results showed a more complex pattern than
expected. For participants with rather high prior knowledge
similar effects were found as in the study by Hertzum et al.
(2009), namely that participants in the prompted TA
condition accessed more Websites than in the other
conditions (in line with H3). However, for participants with
a moderate level of prior knowledge no differences were

Discussion and Conclusion
With the present study we sought to examine the impact of
TA instructions – especially of "prompted" TA instructions
that entail evaluation prompts as used in some previous
studies (e.g. Rieh, 2002; Tombros et al., 2005) – as well as
of prior domain knowledge on participants' information
processing and source evaluation during Web search.

found between conditions, and participants with low prior
knowledge accessed more Websites with neutral TA
instructions than with prompted instructions or when
working in silence. A post-hoc explanation for the latter
finding might be that low-knowledge participants in the
neutral TA condition were overwhelmed by the situation
and did not really know what to say and to do and, thus,
simply selected (almost) all Websites.
Third, with regard to further effects of prior knowledge,
in line with H4 we found that the higher students’ selfreported prior knowledge on diets and nutrition the more
intensively they scrutinized the search results on the SERPs
to decide whether to select them (cf. MaKinster et al.,
2002). Furthermore, in line with H5 participants with lower
prior knowledge across conditions had increased pupil sizes,
which is an indicator of increased cognitive load. This effect
provides further evidence for the assumption proposed by
Bråten et al. (2011) that low-knowledge users have to
employ more cognitive effort in order to comprehend the
content of the Web pages than Web users with higher
domain knowledge. As a consequence, they seem to lack
cognitive resources to engage in evaluations that go beyond
content. This is also indicated by the fact that in both TA
conditions low-knowledge users hardly ever verbally
reflected on the information quality or on the structure of
Web pages. Future research should examine these effects in
greater detail, analyzing more detailed moment-to-moment
changes in participants' pupil sizes and using withinsubjects task variations.
In sum, from a methodological perspective, the present
findings indicate that prompted TA instructions increase
participants' verbal reflections on information quality and on
structural aspects of Web pages, and, therefore, might
overestimate, users' spontaneous reflections about these
issues. Yet, from an educational point of view the findings
of the present study suggest that simple evaluation
instructions that prompt Web users to evaluate search results
and Web pages have the potential to increase their
awareness about the necessity to critically evaluate the
information found on the Web – given that they possess a
certain amount of prior knowledge on the subject matter of
the search task at hand. In order to improve source
evaluations of searchers with no or little prior domain
knowledge, however, more comprehensive instructional
support seems to be required that also includes measures to
reduce individuals' cognitive burden during task processing.
Furthermore, when the WWW is used as a research tool in
formal learning settings (e.g., in school), it seems advisable
that the teacher first provides some general information on
the topic before students start with their Web search.
