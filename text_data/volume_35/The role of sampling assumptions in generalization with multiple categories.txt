Figure 1: Different predictions made by a standard categorization model (the GCM) and a Bayesian model that incorporates a
strong sampling assumption. The GCM, on the left panel, predicts that as the number of instances in a category increases (shown
in the figure by the additional points in the bottom row), generalizations should loosen slightly: the solid line corresponding
to generalizations based on later additional instances in Category A extends further from Category A. By contrast, the model
incorporating strong sampling predicts that generalization based on additional instances will tighten: the solid line in the right
panel is much closer to Category A than the dotted line corresponding to earlier, fewer instances.

   In summary, in both the one- and two-category scenarios,
people had different patterns of generalization from known
instances to new instances based on a cover story that sug-
gested strong or weak sampling was generating the instances
they saw. Additionally, the degree of generalization de-
creased as many more instances were shown from the target
category, more than predicted by standard models of catego-
rization like the GCM but less than predicted by a Bayesian
model that mixed strong and weak sampling. Patterns of
