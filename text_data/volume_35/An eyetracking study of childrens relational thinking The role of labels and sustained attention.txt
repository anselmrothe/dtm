Method
Participants Fifty-eight children (M = 54 months, range =
42-68 months) were randomly assigned to one of four
conditions: Multiple presentation without label, Multiple
presentation with label, Single presentation without label,
Single presentation with label. Twenty additional children
were recruited but not included in the final sample due to
inappropriate calibration, missing video data, refusal to
complete the task or eye tracking data missing for more than
half of the total number of samples. Children had no known
developmental disorders and were reported to have normal

obtained for all participants in compliance with the IRB of
