was the closest to the highest score achieved in the class.
Relative-to-Deviation Principle According to this
principle, the better student was the one who scored a
greater number of standard (average) deviations above the
mean (see Schwartz & Martin, 2004; Belenky & Nokes-
Malach, 2012). This was calculated as the difference from
the mean divided by the average deviation, and is closely
related to a normative measure like the z-score.

effects – in particular, the effect of exposure was not
significant, F(1, 448) < 0.01, p = 0.99, ηp2 < 0.01.
   In the multiple anomalies condition, there was a task x
exposure x principle interaction, F(1, 269) = 5.28, p <
0.05, ηp2 = 0.02. Participants who explained and were
exposed to the hypotheses beforehand were more likely to
mention the relative-to-deviation principle over the non-
normative principles, relative to those who explained
without exposure. A task x exposure ANOVA for just
non-normative principles revealed a main effect of
explaining, F(1, 269) = 5.66, p < 0.05, ηp2 = 0.02, and a
significant interaction, F(1, 269) = 7.76, p < 0.05, ηp2 =

only a main effect of explaining. F(1, 269) = 10.03, p <
