 Figure 3: Simulated ERPs elicited in response to repeated and non-repeated presentations of words, acronyms,
 pseudowords, and illegal strings. The dashed y-axis indicates stimulus onset. All units in the model data are arbitrary.
 In the simulated ERPs, as in the real ERPs, all item types produce reduced semantic activation when an item is
 repeated as compared to when it is not.
