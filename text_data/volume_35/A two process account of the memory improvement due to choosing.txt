Outline of the experiment
   To determine whether freely choosing between a pair of
options causes differences in memory of unchosen and
chosen items, and thus whether one or two processes are
necessary to account for memory improvements due to
choice, I will examine whether our memory for chosen
items is better than our memory for unchosen. Support for
this would demonstrate that the sense of freely choosing is
insufficient on its own to account for memory
