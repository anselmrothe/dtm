Abstract
The TIME IS SPACE metaphor consists in the use of a
spatial mental time line (either left-right or front-back) to
represent time. One of the issues still to be resolved is
whether these space-time mappings can be automatically
activated independently from the goals of the task. Prior
attempts to settle this issue have failed to match adequately
the temporally relevant and irrelevant tasks. In the present
study we presented Spanish verbs and nonverbs conjugated
in past and future forms in both a time judgment and a
lexical decision task. Results showed that the left-right
space-time mapping is only active when the task requires
temporal discrimination, speaking against an automatic
activation of the mental time line.
Keywords: time; space; mental time line; automaticity;
flexibility; embodied cognition; conceptual metaphor.

Introduction
As a response to the symbol grounding problem (Harnad,
1990), the Embodied and Grounded Cognition view (e.g.,
Barsalou, 1999; Gibbs, 2006; Lakoff & Johnson, 1987)
suggests that abstract concepts need to be grounded on
concrete domains (i.e., those more directly based on
sensory-motor experiences) in order to gain meaning.
Under this view, language processing elicits an embodied
simulation which is carried on by the very same neural
systems used by perception, emotion and action
(Barsalou, 2008; Gallese, 2008; Glenberg & Gallese,
2011; Glenberg et al, 2008). When abstract concepts are
referred to, such simulation follows the guide of stored
mappings between abstract and concrete concepts. One
line of support for this idea comes from empirical studies
on the abstract domain of TIME, which seems to be
grounded on the concrete domain of SPACE. Response
time studies have reported interactions between the
processing of the temporal reference of words and
sentences and a variety of response mappings: lateralized
key presses, forward-backward manual movements, vocal
responses (e.g., Boroditsky, 2001; Ouellet et al, 2010b;
Santiago et al, 2007; Sell & Kaschack, 2011; Torralbo et
al, 2006; Ulrich & Maienborn, 2010; Ulrich et al, 2012).
Space-time congruency effects are part of a wide family
of studies that manipulate concrete and abstract
dimensions in tasks that require elaborating and
responding to aspects of the abstract dimension. In this
context, modulations due to task-irrelevant concrete
dimensions are often found on the processing of the
abstract, task-relevant dimension. The resulting

metaphoric congruency effect has been interpreted as the
index of the use of underlying concrete representations to
organize the abstract dimension, as i.e. in the SNARC
effect (Dehaene et al, 1993).
Conceptual Metaphor Theory, which has a longstanding
support from linguistics and psychological studies (e.g.,
Boroditsky, 2000; Clark, 1973; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980,
1999; Núñez & Sweetser, 2006; Talmy, 2000), pointed out
that our vocabulary about abstract concepts has concrete
roots. But one of the most interesting consequences of the
empirical findings on conceptual metaphors has been the
discovery of the existence of metaphoric mappings not
explicitly attested in language (for a review, see Santiago
et al 2011). In the last years, the most studied example has
been one TIME IS SPACE metaphor, which maps
temporal reference onto the left-right horizontal spatial
axis. In contrast to the mapping of time onto the frontback axis, which is explicitly attested in many languages
(e.g., Sell & Kaschack, 2011; Torralbo et al, 2006; Ulrich
et al, 2012), in his review of cross-linguistic space-time
metaphors Radden (2004) observed a total lack of
linguistic conventions directly referring in speech to a
horizontal left-right time dimension. However, we are all
used to conventional associations of time as flowing from
left to right (or right to left) along a horizontal axis in
written language, graphs, and in many types of graphic
devices (e.g., comic strips, calendars, etc.).
The interpretation of conceptual congruency effects as
indexes of stable semantic memory mappings has been
clearly contradicted by recent experimental results. There
is evidence in the literature of different degrees of
flexibility/automaticity depending on the abstract
dimension studied, the task and materials used, the kind of
mappings which are evaluated (Santiago et al, 2011).
Nowadays, there seems to be a well-motivated support to
the idea that conceptual congruency effects could be of a
very contextual nature (e.g., Torralbo et al, 2006; Santiago
et al, 2008; Santiago et al, 2012; Lakens et al, 2012).
One of the strongest cases of automatic activation has
been observed for the mapping of affective evaluation to
front-back responses: participants are faster in responding
to positive and negative items by pulling and pushing a
lever, respectively (e.g., Chen & Bargh, 1999). This
occurs not only when the decision is based on the valence
of the stimuli, but also when performing a lexical decision
task (Wentura et al, 2000) and even a stimulus detection
task (Chen & Bargh, 1999), which minimize the taskrelevance of the evaluative dimension. In contrast, space-

2315

time mappings do not seem to be activated so
automatically. Recently, two studies extending prior
findings with temporal words (e.g., Santiago et al, 2007)
to full sentences have tried to address the question of
whether it is possible to observe an automatic activation
of the mental time-line in an implicit task, investigating
both the left-right (Ulrich & Maienborn, 2010) and the
front-back (Ulrich et al, 2012) axes. These studies asked
participants to carry out both an explicit temporal
judgment task and a sensicality judgment task, observing
space-time congruency effects only on the former.
The findings of Ulrich & Maienborn (2010) on the leftright mental time line left open the possibility that
participants did not need to process the temporal reference
of sentences in the sensicality judgment task. The nonsensical sentences were constructed by matching an agent
and an object that do not fulfill the meaning restrictions of
the verb (i.e, as in the past sentence “The fir trees have put
on their coat while bathing”, or in the future sentence “On
next Sunday, the town-hall will marry the pea”). In order
to judge whether these sentences are sensible or not,
participants might have only assessed whether the action
mentioned by the verb can be done by the actor (with the
object) on the patient. In other words, whether the
arguments fulfill the meaning constraints imposed by the
verb. In order to control for this possibility, in their study
on the front-back mental time line, Ulrich et al (2012)
asked participants in the sensicality task to also perform a
time judgment for each sentence at the end of the trial.
Again, they failed to observe any interaction between
response direction and temporal reference.
Several possibilities are left open by these two studies. A
first one is that participants split their judgments into two
sequential phases: they first focused on assessing meaning
consistency, started response, and then assessed whether
the sentence referred to a past or future event (in which
case, the effect of temporal reference would be missed by
the latency measure). A second, and very interesting
possibility is that meaning access at sentence level is less
automatic than at the word level, because the meaning of
the sequence of words needs to be composed into the
overall sentence meaning. Finally, it might be the case that
the activation of the front-back time line is not automatic,
but we cannot still be certain whether this is also the case
for the left-right mental time line (due to the
methodological concerns discussed above). A more
automatic left-right time line would be consistent with
findings of automatic activation of left-right space in tasks
that required the processing of ordinal sequences (either
learned on the spot or previously known) when the order
dimension was completely irrelevant for the task (e.g.,
Gevers et al, 2004; Previtali et al, 2010), as well as with
the well-known SNARC effect in parity tasks (Dehaene et
al, 1993). It is clear that the issue of automatic activation
of the mental time line is still far from being solved.
In our study we wanted to address simultaneously
several of these possibilities. We focused on the
processing of time-related single words with left and right
responding (thereby testing the activation of the left-right

mental time line) in both time-relevant and time-irrelevant
tasks.
To create our materials, we selected isolated Spanish
verbs with an intransitive reading (e.g., “dormir” - to
sleep). As Spanish is a pronoun drop language, when these
verbs are conjugated in past or future tense, they represent
a full sentence (e.g., “durmió” means “He slept”).
However, their meaning is acquired in a single fixation
and through the activation of a single lexical item. So, the
chances of a slower, more compositional comprehension
strategy are lower. In order to create the nonwords, we
modified the set of verbs by changing only one letter in
their morphological stem. Therefore, the nonverbs did not
pop out as such (e.g., “dormir” was changed to “dorpir”).
Moreover, the nonverbs were also inflected in past and
future (“durpió”). In this way, we made sure that in order
to distinguish the existing from the non-existing verbs,
participants had to pay close attention and deeply
elaborate the stimulus. We presented these stimuli in a
temporal judgment task (decide whether the stimulus
refers to the past or the future; Experiment 1) and in a
lexical decision task (decide whether the stimulus is a
word or a nonword; Experiment 2) with lateralized
manual responses. If the left-right space-time mapping can
be activated automatically, both experiments should
render significant space-time congruency effects.
Otherwise, they should arise only in Experiment 1.

Experiment 1
Experiment 1 used centrally presented Spanish tensed
verbs (technically corresponding to full sentences) and
nonverbs in an explicit temporal judgment task.
Responses were given by means of bimanual lateralized
key presses.

Method
Participants 24 Psychology students from the University
of Granada (5 males; age range 19-26 y.; 2 left-handed by
self-report) participated for course credit. All participants
had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were naive
as to the purposes of the experiment.
Materials We selected 148 Spanish verbs which are
intransitive verbs, or at least allow a (very common)
intransitive use. Such a kind of verbs was chosen because
Spanish is a pro-drop language, so the subject of a verb
can be dropped from the sentence. Thus, single conjugated
intransitive verbs as used here can stand as full,
grammatically correct and sensible sentences. In order to
create the nonword set, each verb was modified by
changing one letter in its stem, with the constraint of
resulting in pronounceable phoneme sequences in
Spanish.
The 148 verbs and 148 nonverbs were then conjugated
in both the simple past perfect indicative and the simple
future indicative (all six possible grammatical persons
were more or less equally represented over the set). This
resulted in 592 experimental stimuli of four types: past
and future verbs, and past and future nonverbs. This total
set was randomly divided into four lists of 148 stimuli

2316

each, avoiding item repetition. For example, from the item
“faltar/falbar” the following four third person singular
tensed versions were created: “faltó” (past verb), “faltará”
(future verb), “falbó” (past nonverb), “falbará” (future
nonverb), and each of them was randomly assigned to one
of the four different lists. Each list was then composed of
37 items of each of the four stimulus types.
Procedure Stimuli were presented centered on a computer
screen (Courier New font, 38 points, lower case), black
printed on white background. Participants sat at a distance
of 60 cm from the computer screen, and placed their left
index finger on the Q key and their right index finger on
the 9 key of the numerical keyboard in a standard
QWERTY keyboard. The distance between response keys
was 32 cm. Each trial began with the presentation of a
central fixation cross (500 ms) followed by the target
verb, that remained on screen until a response was made.
Incorrect trials were followed by a 500 ms red uppercase
X at the same location of the stimulus. Each incorrect trial
was then followed by a 1000 ms blank screen. Correct
trials were followed by a 1500 ms blank screen.
Participants were instructed to decide whether the
presented verb or nonverb referred to either the past or the
future.
The experiment was divided into two blocks of 148
trials (separated by a two minutes break) in which the
same list of stimuli were responded to using two different
mappings of responses (past/future) to keys (left/right).
The order of presentation of the two mappings was
counterbalanced over participants. We did not control for
factors known to affect word recognition times, such as
frequency, length, or age of acquisition, because the
theoretically interesting effect is the interaction between
temporal reference and response hand when participants
process the very same list of stimuli using the two
possible response-key mappings. Each block was
preceded by a short 4 trials training block using different
stimuli. The experiment was programmed and run using
E-prime 2.0.
Design and Analysis Data were analyzed using a mixed
factorial ANOVA with the within-subjects factors Lexical
status (word vs. nonword) x Temporal reference (past vs.
future) x Key (left vs. right). Counterbalance was included
in the design as a between-subjects factor in order to
reduce noise, but because it is of no theoretical relevance,
its main effect or interactions are not reported here.

Results
Errors occurred in 6.43% of trials and were analyzed
independently. Reaction times (RTs) exceeding 2 standard
deviations from each participant’s mean were excluded
from the analysis, leading to the removal of an additional
12.01% of data.
The ANOVA on RTs revealed a significant main effect
of the factor Lexical status (F(1, 22) = 36.55, MSe =
18071.56, p <.001), due to longer latencies for nonwords
(1106 ms) than words (989 ms). This result is completely
in line with the psycholinguistic literature about the

lexicality effect (e.g., Kinoshita el al., 2004; Pagliuca et al,
2010) and shows that participants were unable to focus
only on the verb inflection in order to give their responses.
There was also a Lexical status x Temporal reference
interaction (F(1, 44) = 13.25, MSe = 3451.7, p <.01), due
to past words being faster than future words (982 ms vs.
996 ms, respectively), whereas future nonwords were
faster than past nonwords (1130 ms vs. 1083 ms,
respectively). Finally, and most relevant to current
concerns, there was also a significant interaction between
Temporal reference and Key (F(1, 44) = 12.03, MSe =
16640.96, p <.01), which showed faster responses to past
verbs and nonverbs with the left than with the right hand
(1027 ms vs. 1085 ms, respectively; Newman-Keuls p
<.05) and to future verbs and nonverbs with the right than
with the left hand (1004 ms vs. 1075 ms, respectively;
Newman-Keuls p <.05). This interaction was not
modulated by Lexical status (F(1, 44) = 1.03, MSe =
7707.96, p =.32; Word: Past verbs - left hand M = 943 ms,
Past verbs - right hand M = 1022 ms, Future verbs - left
hand M = 1035 ms, Future verbs - right hand M = 958 ms;
Nonword: Past verbs - left hand M = 1111 ms, Past verbs right hand M = 1150 ms, Future verbs - left hand M =
1116 ms, Future verbs - right hand M = 1050 ms).
The analyses of accuracy revealed only a main effect of
Lexical status (F(1, 22) = 6.03, MSe = 2.43, p <.05),
which confirmed a greater easiness for participants in
processing and responding to words than nonwords (2.1
vs. 2.7 mean errors, respectively).
No other main effects or interactions were significant.

reference and Key in Experiment 1.

Discussion
Experiment 1 found a significant interaction between
temporal reference of the stimulus and side of response,
taking the form of a standard left-right space-time
congruency effect: responses to past sentences were faster
with the left hand and responses to future sentences were
faster with the right hand, independently of their
lexicality. These results replicate and extend prior findings
in the literature (e.g., Torralbo el al., 2006; Santiago el al.,
2007; Ulrich & Maienborn, 2010), suggesting, firstly, that
a left-to-right mental time-line have been activated in this
task, and secondly, that lexical status does not modulate its
activation. In other words, the mental time line is used to
process the temporal reference of both meaningful and

2317

meaningless words (which are also simple sentences in
Spanish).

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 only differed from the prior experiment in
the task instructions: participants were asked to decide
whether the stimuli were real Spanish verbs or not. Thus,
they carried out a lexical decision task for which temporal
reference is irrelevant. The design of the experimental
materials made sure that temporal reference information
was equally present and salient in both the words and the
nonwords.

In the analyses of accuracy there was a main effect of
Lexical status (F(1, 22) = 10.28, MSe = 2.85, p <.01),
which indicated again that words were easier to process
than non-words (1.5 vs. 2.3 mean errors, respectively).
No other main effect or interactions were significant.

Method
Participants 24 Psychology students from the University
of Granada (1 male; age range 20-25 y.; 4 left-handed by
self-report) participated for course credit. All participants
had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were naive
as to the purposes of the experiment.

reference and Key in Experiment 2.

Discussion
Materials and procedure Everything was identical to
Experiment 1, with the only exception of the instructions:
participants decided whether the stimuli were real Spanish
verbs or not.

Design and Analysis
The data were analyzed using a mixed factorial ANOVA
with the same factors as in Experiment 1: Lexical status
(word vs. nonword) x Temporal reference (past vs. future)
x Key (left vs. right) x Counterbalance (not reported
further).

The central observation of Experiment 2 was the absence
of interaction between left-right responses and temporal
reference. This null result occurred in the context of a very
clear and sizeable interaction obtained in Experiment 1
using the same stimuli, procedures and participant
population. Therefore, it seems that even when specially
designed stimuli are used to make sure that temporal
reference is processed, the emergence of a congruency
effect between left-right space and time is strongly
mediated by the context and the goal of the task: the effect
can only be found when temporal processing is taskrelevant.

Results
Errors occurred in 5.19% of trials and were analyzed
independently. Reaction times (RTs) exceeding 2 standard
deviations from each participant’s mean were excluded
from the analysis, leading to the removal of an additional
9.56% of data.
The ANOVA on RTs reported two significant main
effects. First, as expected, there was a main effect of
Lexical status (F(1, 22) = 64.84, MSe = 4141.01, p <.001):
latencies for nonwords (883 ms) were longer than for
words (808 ms) as in Experiment 1. Second, the factor
Temporal reference (F(1, 22) = 26.22, MSe = 2464.2, p
<.001) was also significant, indicating shorter latencies for
past (828 ms) than for future verbs (864 ms). No other
main effects or interactions were significant in the RTs
analyses. Thus, the lexical decision task failed to replicate
the Temporal reference x Key interaction obtained in
Experiment 1 (F < 1; Past verbs - left hand M = 831 ms,
Past verbs - right hand M = 824 ms, Future verbs - left
hand M = 866 ms, Future verbs - right hand M = 862 ms).
An omnibus ANOVA pooling together both experiments
with the between-subjects factor Task (temporal vs.
lexical) and the same within-subjects factors mentioned
above revealed a significant three-way interaction
between Task x Temporal reference x Key (F(1, 46) =
12.59, MSe = 8342.15, p <.001). This confirmed that the
two tasks generated different patterns of results.

General Discussion
The present study addressed the question of the
automaticity of the activation of the left-right mental timeline. In line with prior findings (e.g., Torralbo et al, 2006;
Ulrich & Maienborn 2010; Ulrich et al, 2012) there is
flexibility, not automaticity, in the activation of the mental
time-line(s). Short, single words and nonwords especially
designed to secure a deep processing generated a strong
space-time congruency effect when participants judged
their temporal reference, but failed to do it in a lexical
decision task. This result agrees well with the conclusions
obtained by Ulrich et al (2012) regarding the front-back
time line with longer sentences in German, and
corroborates those by Ulrich and Maienborn (2010)
regarding the left-right time line without some of their
potential confoundings.
Present results are also consistent with the view that, all
other factors being equal, only the conceptual mappings
that are required to carry out the task are set up in working
memory (Santiago et al, 2011). It also agrees well with the
flexibility observed in the literature on the automaticity of
affordance effects (e.g., Borghi et al, 2012; Natraj et al,
2013).
Obviously, present results leave open many future lines
of inquiry, and the issue of the automaticity (or lack
thereof) of the activation of the mental time line is still not

2318

closed. An important remaining question is whether it is
possible to observe the activation of the mental time line
in time-irrelevant tasks using different conditions. One
interesting possibility has to do with the use of temporal
stimuli which have a more direct link to temporal
reference, such as dates, months or weekdays. Another
possibility is that a more sensitive measure might be able
to find the effects (e.g., mouse trajectories). Data are
currently being collected about this latter possibility
If the activation of the mental time line remains taskdependent, then there raises the question of why. Other
conceptual mappings on the spatial dimension have been
shown to be activated automatically at least under certain
conditions (e.g., evaluation with approach-avoidance
responses, Chen & Barg, 1999; or number magnitude,
Dehaene et al, 1993). Space and time seem to be
intrinsically linked from the initial stages in development
(Piaget, 1969) and the influence of space on temporal
judgments in psychophysics tasks remains until the adult
age (Casasanto & Boroditsky, 2008; Casasanto et al,
2010). Why then participants do not activate the spatial
dimension automatically when processing linguistic
stimuli with a temporal reference? Future research needs
to address this question.
In conclusion, present results corroborate that the leftright space-time congruency effect is strongly mediated by
the context and goal of the task, such that it only arises
when the task explicitly requires judging temporal
reference.
