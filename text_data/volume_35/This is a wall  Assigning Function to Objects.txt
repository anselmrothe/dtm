Our data set contained 50 think-aloud protocols that were
equally distributed between conditions (17 underspecified
goal, 16 verbal goal, 17 verbal and visual goal), and 16
instructions. First, mapping phrases were identified in a
qualitative analysis. They contained one object reference

(3) „jeweils mit einem kurzen Stück einem ähm einem

element)
   In this example the object (a small piece) is assigned its
function (wall element) by simply renaming it after a
hesitation phase. Since there is no relational term connecting
object reference and functional term, no conclusions can be
drawn about the level of certainty reflected in this strategy.
This type is called reframing because the speaker changes
the frame of conceptualization from unspecific to specific.
The distribution of mapping strategies shows that instructors
used direct mapping most frequently (M = 0.63, SD = 0.20).
A closer look at the linguistic structure of direct mapping
reveals that the verb ‘be’ was used in all cases; instructors
never used modal verbs to assign function. Furthermore,
