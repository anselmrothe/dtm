   We begin by offering a review of PNG representations, pro-

we find problematic. We then conclude with a brief discus-

            Polychronous Neuronal Groups
Polychronous Neuronal Groups (PNGs) have been pro-
posed as a possible unit of representation in the human
brain (Izhikevich, 2006). A PNG is a reproducible, time-
locked, spatiotemporal spike-timing pattern over a collection
of neurons. They are reproducible in the sense that the se-                   Figure 1: A small neural network with time delays.
