children, whereas the extent to which these effects are
present in adults was less clear. Previous research suggests
that RI effects are present in adults, to the extent that the
learned material is sufficiently similar and cognitively
challenging across phases (Dewar et al., 2007; French,
1999; Wixted, 2004). Also, given that cognitive control
abilities are substantially more advanced in adults and given
that PI effects depend on cognitive control (Baker et al.,
2010; Dick, 2012; Kiesel et al., 2010), we expected that PI
effects, if found, should be greater in children than in adults.

to that side!”) in addition to the tone. The side of the
object’s reappearance was predicted by the object pair. In
this way, subjects were able to learn the contingency
between object pairs and outcomes.
   The identity of the object pairings depended on the phase
of the experiment: phase 1 consisted of learning four pairs
of objects (such that two pairs reappeared on the left side of
the occluder and two on the right). The objects were re-
paired in phase 2, such that new learning required subjects
to create new associations with the same objects and
potential outcomes. The third phase was identical to the first
phase, except that order of stimulus presentation varied
between phases. Table 1 illustrates the abstract structure of
object and outcome pairings in this experiment. For phases
1-3, each letter represents an object, while the outcome
indicates the side of the object’s reappearance from the
occluder. Note that each pair in phase 2 includes an object
that was associated with the opposite outcome in phase 1.
   As noted above, the visual context of these stimuli
changed between the phases to facilitate learning and
recognition of different learning outcomes in the different
phases. Participants were not informed that the context
would change between the phases, nor were they told that
they would be learning new associations in phase 2 or that
they would be relearning the associations from phase 1 in
the third phase. Forty trials (10 per pair of objects) were
presented to each participant per phase, for a total of 120
trials. Subjects were invited to take short breaks between
phases.
