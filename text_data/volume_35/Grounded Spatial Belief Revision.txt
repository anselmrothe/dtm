In fact, they move the objects in the model around to obtain
a model consistent with the newly available information.
We could show these mental operations are affected by the
imagined physical properties of the objects. With the next
experiment, we tried to replicate this effect with objects
which are easy or difficult to move. The question is again:
does object property affect reasoning and belief revision? Is
the physical challenge related to a difficult movable object
