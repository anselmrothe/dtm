   An explanatory note about the daily recall tests with intact
and “temporarily lesioned” HC: these tests are performed
without affecting the continued evolution of the system. No
learning or (re)consolidation takes place, and HC is turned
back on after testing. The simulation then continues as if the
tests had not taken place. Researchers with live subjects, of
course, do not have this luxury; in an analogous experiment,
they would only be able to get one data point from each                 Figure 3: Consolidation. a) Connection weight of a

   As expected, HC connections quickly learn the presented          hippocampal trace decays after initial training as in the
pattern, and then decay exponentially. NC connections, on           previous simulation and is boosted by the reactivation
the other hand, quickly become very plastic, but learn only
gradually. Around day 17 the HC trace has become too faint
for any further consolidation to take place, and the NC trace
starts to decay somewhat, but the decay slows down as the
plasticity diminishes further and the trace becomes
stabilized.
   Figure 3c shows the recall performance during the
simulation. The upper curve, representing recall in the intact
system, shows normal forgetting. The lower curve, recall
performance with disabled HC layer, shows a gradient
during the consolidation “window”, followed by constant
performance. These results are similar to those obtained
with the original TraceLink model (Meeter & Murre, 2005);
the difference is that forgetting there was purely
interference-based, whereas in this simulation it is caused by
a combination of interference and decay. (Interference plays
a role even though only a single pattern is trained, because
the patterns reinforced during (re)consolidation may differ
from the trained pattern.)
