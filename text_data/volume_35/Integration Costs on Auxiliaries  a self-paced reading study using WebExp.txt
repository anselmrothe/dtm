we use linear mixed effects models from the R lme4 pack-
age (R. Baayen, 2008; R. H. Baayen, Davidson, & Bates,
2008). This type of model can be thought of as a generaliza-
tion of linear regression that allows the inclusion of random
factors as well as fixed factors. We treat subjects and items
as a random factors, which means that our models contain an
intercept term for each subject and each item, representing
the individual differences among the subjects and differences
between our items. Furthermore, we include random slopes
under both subject and item for our predictor (relative clause
type), essentially accounting for idiosyncrasies of a partici-
pant or item with respect to the predictor, such that only the
part of the variance that is common to all participants and all
items is attributed to the main effect for our predictor.
   We excluded as outliers any reading times shorter than
100msec or longer than 1000msec.
