this technique works well for nonlinear functions as well as
linear ones, as we are in effect projecting into a higher di-
mensional space than our representation, effectively turning a
nonlinear function into one that is linear in the weight space.
Population dynamics
The NEF also defines a way of computing functions de-
fined over time, or dynamic functions. Incorporating time-
dependance is important in understanding and modelling neu-
ral responses, since in the real world, neural activity is de-
pendant on time. In general, we describe a linear dynamic
function by dx/dt ≡ ẋ = A(x) + B(u), where x is the value
currently being represented, and u is an input value from an-
other ensemble.
   One useful example of such a function           is a two-
dimensional oscillator, defined by A = −1     0 1 . To have an

ensemble exhibit this behavior, we define a recurrent connec-
tion from this population to itself as described in Eliasmith
and Anderson (2003). As shown there, it is possible to solve
for the connection weights that allow the ensemble to exhibit
the desired behavior, allowing for the implementation of ar-
bitrary dynamical systems.
     Visual motion processing and perceptual
                      decision making
The circuit we propose has three main information process-
ing stages: 1) a velocity filter that uses the principle of
oscillator interference to determine the direction and speed
of pattern motion using networks of V1 simple cells; 2) a
retinotopic representation of motion evidence in MT; and 3)
competition-less integration of sensory evidence over time by
an n-dimensional vector integrator in LIP. A schematic circuit

the NEF is defined for vector representations, these weights
will result in a neural state that represents the integration of
information in the dimensionality of x (in this case D = 2).
Multi-dimensional integrators of this sort have been previ-
ously employed in neural models of working memory (Singh
& Eliasmith, 2006), but not for decision making.
                         Experiment
Model implementation
The neural system simulation package used to implement
the circuit was Nengo, (http://nengo.ca). Table 1 pro-
vides the neurophysiological parameters used. A total of
2.9×105 spiking LIF neurons were used. The random-dot mo-
tion movies were generated using the Psychtoolbox-3 exten-
sions for Matlab R (Kleiner, Brainard, & Pelli, 2007; Pelli,
1997; Brainard, 1997). The visual input signal was in the pre-
ferred directions of the associated V1 oscillators. To simulate

Decision test description                                           2007).
We performed a two-alternative, forced-choice, fixed du-
ration test of 1-second duration, using variable coherence
random-dot motion movies for a single patch. The decision
threshold value was held fixed and was the only parameter
adjusted to fit behavioural data. The length of the percept
state vector, when the average success rate of the circuit was
80%, was used as the decision radius (analogous to the deci-
sion threshold use by Gold and Shadlen for the same test in
monkey trials (Gold & Shadlen, 2007). The coherence level
(motion strength) was lowered progressively, decreasing mo-
tion information and stressing the signal-to-noise ratio resolv-
ing capability of the circuit. For each coherence level 10 tests
were run.
                            Results
The model was able to determine direction of motion in the
majority of cases down to about 5% coherency (Figure 5), and
showed similar characteristics to data collected from mon-
keys in (Gold & Shadlen, 2007). Particularly, as shown in
Figure 4, neuron responses in area MT stayed relatively con-
stant over time, with certain neurons showing stronger fir-
ing rates when given stronger motion evidence (higher co-
herency). At the same time, neuron responses in area LIP
got stronger over time, particularly when nearing the decision
threshold under medium to high coherency. Additionally, as
