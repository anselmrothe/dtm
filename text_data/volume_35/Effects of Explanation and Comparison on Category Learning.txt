these studies provide valuable insights into the conditions

  The present studies examine whether and how

novel categories. Previous work using similar materials

participants prompted to explain why individual robots
belong to particular categories are more likely to discover a
categorization rule that accounts for all cases (Williams &

Method
Participants One-hundred-sixty-one adults participated in
the study through the Amazon Mechanical Turk

were excluded because they failed a catch trial or because
they had previously completed a similar experiment.

   These results suggest that the poor performance of
participants prompted to compare in Experiment 1 was not
due to the restriction to within-category comparisons.
Experiment 3 thus considers whether a broader within-
category comparison, one that focuses on all four items at
once, might lead to better learning.
