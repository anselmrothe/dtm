                       Experiment 1
In Experiment 1a, our goal was to replicate the primacy
effect reported by Gebhart, Aslin, and Newport (2009) by
presenting learners with two consecutive artificial languages
with no explicit cue to the transition. We subsequently
extend the study by manipulating the number of transitions
between the two languages during the familiarization phase.
Thus, in Experiment 1b, we control for the amount of
exposure to each language while adding additional transition
points (i.e., presenting four 2-minute 45-second blocks of
each language versus two 5:30 blocks in Experiment 1a).
