Birmingham et al. (2008) that have been shown to trigger
rapid and sustained eye movements to the eyes of the
individuals in the scenes. The social scenes either depicted 1

were used directly in Experiment 2.1 Exploratory eye
movements are potentially affected by the saliency
distribution of the stimuli (Itti, Koch, & Niebur, 1998). For
example, stimuli with widely distributed salient locations
could lead to a distributed eye movement pattern, and
stimuli with salient locations concentrated in a small area
could lead to a concentrated pattern. For this reason, we
ensured that the image areas spanned by the most salient
points were matched across image types.2

Data Analysis A one-way repeated-measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the average
preference and exploration ratings of the interior, landscape,
and social scenes.

There was a main effect of scene type on the average
