Abstract
A remarkable property of human cognition is the systematic
co-occurrence of certain cognitive abilities. One challenge for
cognitive science is to determine the (computational) principles that derive this property as part of a broader goal of establishing the foundations of cognitive architecture (i.e. the
basic processes and modes of combination affording cognitive capacity) for a science of cognition. This paper continues
a category theory approach to compositionality and cognitive
capacity that posits universal construction (e.g., products) as
a fundamental cognitive architectural component. As shown
here, products can be modeled in other frameworks, thereby
providing a link between an abstract computational principle
and a concrete cognitive resource needed for particular capacities. For example, a network of weighted connections implementing a categorical product uses fewer resources when the
number of task instances sharing a common product structure
is greater than two; otherwise it is more economic to realize
each instance independently. This cross-over may explain why
human cognition is not always systematic: the cost of universal
construction may not outweigh its expected gain.

Introduction
A remarkable property of human cognition is the systematic
co-occurrence of certain cognitive abilities. For example, if
one has the ability to infer square as the first shape in the pair
(square, triangle), then one also has the ability to infer triangle
as the first shape in the pair (triangle, square), assuming that
squares and triangles are recognizable. This property is called
systematicity (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988), and is characterized
as having capacity c1 if and only if c2 (McLaughlin, 2009),
i.e., as an equivalence class of cognitive capacities.
For cognitive science, a major challenge has been to explain why cognitive capacity is systematically distributed in
a particular (non-arbitrary) way. The main theoretical frameworks propose some form of compositionality to explain systematic cognitive capacity. The classical (symbol system)
explanation is that cognitive processes are sensitive to grammatical structure (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988). Thus, the two
shape capacities (above) are inseparable because they involve
a common process: say, (p, q) → p, where p and q are symbols for squares and triangles, on the assumption of having
component processes , 4 → p, q for recognizing squares
and triangles.1 Similarly, a connectionist (neural network)
account of capacity can make use of common processes in

pertains to “molecular” not “atomic” capacities,
hence that an architecture permits the recognition of squares, but
not triangles, is not a counterexample to having the systematicity
property (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988).

the form of activation units and weighted connections modeling cognitive processes that are sensitive to spatial structure (Phillips & Wilson, to appear). In this case, the two
shape capacities factor through a common (sub)network of
weighted connections that map (neuronal) vector representations of shape pairs to first shapes. Although classical and
connectionist models can be constructed such that capacity
c1 if and only if c2 , systematicity doesn’t necessarily follow
from classical, or connectionist principles: one can also devise models from those principles such that c1 , but not c2 .
Additional, ad hoc (i.e. arbitrary) assumptions are needed
to exclude models that lack systematicity. So, classical and
connectionist theories (principles) fail to fully explain systematicity (Aizawa, 2003).
Another approach to the systematicity problem (Phillips &
Wilson, 2010, 2011, 2012) used a mathematical theory of
structure, called category theory (Mac Lane, 2000). In category theory, a universal construction relates a collection of
arrows (interpreted as cognitive processes) via a common mediating arrow (cognitive process) in a unique way. Hence, all
capacities are indivisibly linked to this mediating arrow as
the common component. The mediating arrow is associated
with an equivalence class of systematically related cognitive
capacities (Phillips & Wilson, 2011, Text S4).
This paper further explores a categorical approach to compositionality and cognitive capacity by looking at the relationship between universality and cognitive resources. First, our
category theory approach to the systematicity problem, and
related models, are recalled to motivate its continued use here.
Then, the relationship between a specific universal construction (product) and the resources needed for implementation
are examined: fewer resources are needed when the number
of task instances sharing a product is greater than two; otherwise, it is cheaper to realize each task instance independently.
The implications of this relationship for development (learning) are discussed in the final section.

Compositionality and universal constructions
Definitions of category and product are provided in this section. Other definitions are provided in Appendix A. Deeper
introductions to category theory can be found in many books
on the subject (see, e.g., Mac Lane, 2000; Simmons, 2011).

Category theory and cognition
Category theory starts with a definition of a category, which
is a collection of objects and relations between objects, called
arrows (or morphisms, or maps). The category theory approach to cognition presented here regards a cognitive archi-

3223

tecture (i.e., the basic component processes and the ways in
which those processes are combined) as a category (of possibly other categories), where objects are interpreted as components of the architecture and arrows are relations between
those components. For instance, an object may be a set of
cognitive representational states and an arrow may be a function between two sets of states (objects) that transforms cognitive representations (states).
Definition (Category). A category C consists of:
• a class of objects |C| = (A, B, . . . );
• for each pair of objects A and B in C, a set C(A, B) of morphisms (also called arrows, or maps) from A to B, where
each morphism f : A → B has A as its domain and B as its
codomain, including the identity morphism 1A : A → A for
each object A; and
• a composition operation, denoted “◦”, of morphisms f :
A → B and g : B → C, written g ◦ f : A → C that satisfies
the laws of:
– identity, where f ◦ 1A = f = 1B ◦ f , ∀ f : A → B; and
– associativity, where h ◦ (g ◦ f ) = (h ◦ g) ◦ f , ∀ f : A →
B, g : B → C, h : C → D.
An example of a category is Set, which has sets for objects
and total functions for arrows, where the identities are the
identity functions and composition is function composition.
Set is used here to model cognitive architecture as a collection of sets of representational states and cognitive processes
as functions sending states to states, where identities are “do
nothing” functions.
Most models of cognition support some kind of compositionality that affords the representation of a pair of entities
from which the constituent entity representations are recoverable. In category theory, a basic kind of (universal) construction of a pair of objects from which the component objects
are recoverable is called a product.2
Definition (Product). In a category C, a product of two objects A and B is an object P (also denoted A × B) together with
two morphisms p1 : P → A and p2 : P → B, such that for every object Z ∈ |C| and every pair of morphisms f : Z → A and
g : Z → B, there is a unique morphism u : Z → P (also denoted
h f , gi, since it is determined by f and g), such that f = p1 ◦ u
and g = p2 ◦ u, as indicated in commutative diagram3

2 A closely related construction involving pairs of objects is
called coproduct, which is obtained by reversing the directions of
the arrows in the definition of product (Mac Lane, 2000).
3 I.e. where all pairs of paths (one or both having more than one
arrow) from the same start object to the same finish object are equal.

In Set, the Cartesian product of sets A and B is the set
A × B = {(a, b)|a ∈ A, b ∈ B} together with functions p1 :
(a, b) 7→ a and p2 : (a, b) 7→ b recovering the first and second elements of each pair is a product. Accordingly, for any
set Z and functions f and g there is a unique function, called
the product function, h f , gi : z 7→ ( f (z), g(z)), that maps each
element z ∈ Z to the pair of elements ( f (z), g(z)) with the desired elements f (z) ∈ A and g(z) ∈ Z recoverable via p1 and
p2 . Projections p1 and p2 are part of this universal construction; they are the same functions employed for every Z, f
and g. Cartesian product is an instance of categorical compositionality, and a concrete example of deriving systematicity
with regard to the shape-pairs example (see next).

Categorical compositionality and systematicity
A challenge for cognitive science is to explain why cognitive
capacity is organized in a particular way: e.g., why is it that if
one can infer square as the first shape in the pair (square, triangle), then one can infer triangle as the first shape in the pair
(triangle, square), given that they can recognize squares and
triangles; yet, the capacity to infer squares and triangles is
independent of the capacity to count? The general, categorytheoretic claim is that underlying every collection of systematically related cognitive capacities is a universal construction
of some kind. Each member of a collection of systematically
related capacities is realized by two cognitive components: a
common component and a unique capacity-specific component.4 The presence or absence of the common arrow implies
the presence or absence of the entire collection of capacities.
For the shapes example, the common arrow(s) corresponds to
a capacity to retrieve the first and second elements of a pair,
and the unique arrow corresponds to recognition of specific
shape instances. By contrast, the capacity to count involves
a different kind of universal construction (Phillips & Wilson,
2012), and hence a different mediating arrow.

Models of categorical compositionality
The relationship to the above categorical theory of compositionality and systematicity to specific (classical, or connectionist) models is analogous to a relationship in categorical
algebra, where a model of (say) a theory of groups is a functor (a structure-preserving map, see Appendix A) from a category representing the theory and a category capturing the
semantics of the model, e.g., Set, where the group is based
on elements of a set (Lawvere, 1963). A (classical or connectionist) model of categorical compositionality and therefore
systematicity is a functor from a universal construction (as a
category) to a particular concrete category of cognitive representations and processes.5
Returning to the shape example, suppose we model cognitive architecture in the category Set where objects are sets of
cognitive representations and arrows are cognitive processes

Appendix A for the general form of universal construction.
compose, so a model at one level may be construed
as a theory (functor image as a category) relative to a model of that
theory at another level (functor from it into another category).

where S = {square, triangle} is a set of elements representing square and triangle, S × S = {(square, triangle), . . . } is
the set of all pairwise combinations of square and triangle, Z = {4} is a singleton set containing the image of
a square to the left of a triangle, Z 0 = {4} is a singleton set containing the image of a triangle to the left of a
square, fst : 4 7→ square maps the image of a square and
triangle to square, snd : 4 7→ triangle maps the image of
a square and triangle to triangle, and u = hfst, sndi : 4 7→
(square, triangle). Functions fst0 and snd0 are defined similarly. Systematicity is realized by common mediating functions (projections) p1 : (square, triangle) 7→ square, . . . and
p2 : (square, triangle) 7→ triangle, . . . . This model can be regarded as classical where each element is a symbol, and the
constituents of the complex symbols for each pair are tokened
whenever each pair is tokened—classical compositionality.
Another model is obtained from the category Vec of vector spaces for objects and linear functions for arrows. In the
case of the objects and arrows in Diagram 2, suppose S is a
vector space over the field of real numbers containing vectors
~s and ~t representing square and triangle, respectively. Likewise, suppose Z and Z 0 are vector spaces containing vectors
~st and ~ts representing the images 4 and 4, respectively.
A product object in Vec is a product vector space. Hence,
S × S is a product vector space of vector space S with itself
containing all pairwise products of vectors ~s and ~t, e.g., ~s ~t
and ~t ~s, etc. In this model, the arrows are linear functions
mapping vectors in one space to vectors in another space.
Specifically, fst : ~st 7→ ~s, hfst, sndi : ~st 7→ ~s~t, p1 : ~s~t 7→ ~s and
p2 : ~s ~t 7→ ~t (similarly for the other arrows). If we choose
particular bases for these vector spaces, then we have a category of coordinate spaces, and the linear functions are realized as matrices, where the identities are identity matrices and
composition is matrix multiplication. Further, if we identify
each basis vector with a neuron, hence each object is a collection of real-valued neurons, and each matrix as a matrix of
weighted connections between neurons in different objects,
then we have a connectionist network realizing this model.
Systematicity is realized by common linear functions p1 and
p2 . Note that there is no requirement that constituent vectors
be tokened whenever their host product vectors are tokened
(e.g., the coordinates specifying~s are not necessarily a subset
of the coordinates specifying ~s~t)—connectionist (functional)
compositionality.
The vector spaces and linear functions in this Vec-based
model of compositionality contain many more vectors and

mappings than may be needed as a model of cognitive capacity. A further connectionist refinement of the model may
be to add connections between neurons within an object, e.g.,
as in a Hopfield network (Hopfield, 1982), so as to restrict
the number of representational states to just those needed (in
the shape example, two vectors representing square and triangle for the object S, and four vectors representing each pairwise combination of square and triangle for the product object
S × S). In this case, we have networks (not just collections of
neurons) for objects, whence we need some kind of structurepreserving map for arrows satisfying the usual axioms to be
a category. However, not just any combination of objects and
arrows constitutes a product (see next). One possibility, for
further work, is to extend the category Gph of graphs and
graph homomorphisms, which has products,6 by considering
a connectionist network as a graph with additional structure.7

(Non-)Universality and cognitive capacity
Understanding the relationship between universal constructions, systematic cognitive capacity and cognitive resources
requires a specific model of categorical compositionality that
gives meaning to a concept of cognitive resource. An example of compositionality that does not involve a universal construction follows. Suppose a Set-based model of the
shape-related capacities, shown in Diagram 3, that consists
of an object T = {t1 ,t2 } and arrows g1 : Z → T ; 4 7→ t1 ,
h1 : T → S;t1 7→ square,t2 7→ triangle and h2 : T → S;t1 7→
triangle,t2 7→ square, where composition h1 ◦ g1 correctly infers square as the first object from image 4 and h2 ◦ g1 correctly infers triangle as the second object from image 4.
Likewise, suppose arrow g2 : Z 0 → T ; 4 7→ t2 , where composition h1 ◦ g2 correctly infers triangle as the first object
from image 4 and h2 ◦ g2 correctly infers square as the
second object from image 4. The object T together with
arrows h1 and h2 do not constitute a product, because for object Z 00 = {} and arrows fst00 : Z 00 → S;  7→ square and
snd00 : Z 00 → S;  7→ square there does not exist an arrow
u00 : Z 00 → T such that h1 ◦ u00 = fst00 and h2 ◦ u00 = snd00 . This
arrangement does not support the systematically related capacities of inferring square as the first and second shapes from
the image . (A similar lack of systematicity also applies
for image 44, etc.)

a categorical product of sets A and B is the size of set A times
the size of set B. This additional cost in resources to represent
a universal construction raises the question of why a cognitive
system would incur such an expense. As shown in the next
section, implementing a categorical product becomes cheaper
when the number of task instances sharing a common product
structure exceeds a certain number. That number depends on
the relative costs of representing the task-common and taskspecific components.

Resources and (non-)universal constructions
A simple calculation for the resources needed to realize a sequence of task instances with a common product structure
using non-universal versus universal constructions reveals a
cross-over point. Suppose a sequence of tasks such that each
task i ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . , n} consists of two maps fi : Zi → A and
gi : Zi → B. Consider a cognitive system without the capacity
for constructing products. To realize n such tasks, a cognitive
system must implement 2n functions (i.e. two functions for
each task instance). Consider a second architecture with the
capacity to construct a product (A × B, p1 , p2 ). In this case,
the n tasks are realized by the two projections p1 : A × B → A
and p2 : A×B → B, and the n unique functions ui : Zi → A×B,
totalling n + 2 functions. Thus, the advantage of constructing products is obtained when n > 2, i.e. when the cognitive
system must have a capacity for three or more task instances
sharing the same product structure.
The precise relationship between cognitive resource and
systematic cognitive capacity will depend on the underlying model and the kind of universal construction. The general form of a universal construction (given in Appendix A)
with respect to a functor F is a pair (A, φ) such that each capacity f : F(Z) → Y is composed of a common component
φ : F(A) → Y and a unique component F(u) : F(Z) → F(A)
such that f = φ ◦ F(u). Hence, the number of task instances
(n) at which fewer resources are deployed to realize capacity
via a universal construction will depend on the relative costs
of realizing components φ, F(u) and f . The benefit of universal constructions is more pronounced when the most expensive part of realizing f is with φ, since the φ construction is
only required once, whereas one F(u) component is required
for each task instance. In general, computing with universal
constructions over n tasks becomes cheaper when
n>

cost(φ)
cost( f ) − cost(F(u))

(4)

Hence, the benefit of universal construction will be obtained
from fewer task instances when the cost of constructing each
unique component F(u) is low compared to each f . Otherwise, the benefits will only start to accrue after realizing
many task instances.

Discussion
Category theory generalizes the classical and connectionist
notions of compositionality. Classical compositionality is the

idea that representations of the constituents of complex entities are tokened, in a consistent way, whenever the representations of their complex host entities are tokened (Fodor &
Pylyshyn, 1988). Symbol systems are the paradigmatic classical cognitive architecture, e.g., where the symbols representing constituents John, Mary, and loves appear in the symbolic representation of complex entity John loves Mary. Categorical compositionality generalizes this idea from symbols
to arrows, and from tokening to arrow composition, while
specializing the kinds of compositions to those that constitute universal constructions. This specialization is crucial to
avoid otherwise arbitrary assumptions over which modes of
tokening capture systematicity.
Connectionist compositionality is the idea that representations of complex entities are a function of the representations of their constituent entities without necessarily being
tokened whenever the complex host representation is tokened
(van Gelder, 1990). Category theory generalizes this idea
from functions between sets to arrows between objects with
additional internal structure beyond set membership and spatial structure (e.g., a graph, or a group), while specializing
to functors (which appear in the definition of universal construction) that preserve that internal structure. This specialization is crucial, since although a functor is a kind of generalized function mapping objects and arrows, not all generalized functions are functors (i.e., preserve identity and associativity). Again, specialization is crucial to avoid arbitrary
assumptions over which generalized functions capture systematicity.

Systematic capacity and cognitive development
Models of universal constructions provide a functorial link
from an abstract computational principle to a concrete cognitive resource. A connectionist example illustrated this point
as a capacity-resource tradeoff. This non-universal situation
may arise during cognitive development when the cognitive
system does not have sufficient cognitive/neural resources to
compute products, as suggested by the example in Set. Consistent with this idea, a category theory approach to the analysis of reasoning in young children explained developmental
differences in terms of the capacity to compute (co)products
(Phillips, Wilson, & Halford, 2009). The analysis was based
on empirical evidence from multi-paradigm studies where
children from different age groups were tested on various reasoning tasks under easy and hard conditions (see Halford,
1993): a repeatedly observed result (see, e.g., Andrews &
Halford, 2002; Andrews, Halford, Bunch, Bowden, & Jones,
2003; Andrews, Halford, Murphy, & Knox, 2009) was that
if a child (typically older than five years) was significantly
above chance for both easy and hard conditions on one reasoning task (e.g., transitive inference), then that child was
significantly above chance for easy and hard conditions on
another reasoning task (e.g., class inclusion); conversely, if
a child (typically younger than five years) was significantly
above chance for the easy, but not the hard condition on one
task, then they were significantly above chance for the easy,

3226

but not the hard condition on another task. Analysis of the
easy and hard conditions for seven reasoning tasks used to
test children in such multi-paradigm studies showed that all
hard conditions involved some kind of binary (co)product, in
contrast to the easy conditions that did not, or what could also
be called a unary (co)product8 (Phillips et al., 2009).9
This relationship between universality and cognitive resource may shed light on why human cognition is not always systematic: the initial (short-term) cost of realizing a
universal construction does not outweigh the expected (longterm) gain. Put in more familiar terms, when faced with
a problem one often has two choices: devise a quick and
simple solution that works for the current situation only, or
a general-purpose solution that takes more time to develop.
This choice will depend on how likely the same problem will
reappear in other contexts, and whether the cost of developing
a general-purpose solution will be repaid in subsequent savings. From a developmental perspective, this choice may be
forced: the necessity of having a solution that works at least
for the currently presented cases may preclude development
of a general-purpose alternative. Hence, children may first go
through a period of non-systematicity before attaining some
forms of systematic cognitive capacity.
If non-systematicity is forced by the immediate demands
on having a functioning system, then how do universal constructions (systematic capacity) eventually develop? The development of universal constructions may be driven (in part)
by limited cognitive resources and the subsequent need to
simultaneously realize multiple instances of tasks sharing a
common component.
Further work is needed to explore the implications of the
relationship between compositionality, systematic cognitive
capacity and cognitive resource. The category-theoretic analysis presented here identified the essence of this relationship.

Definition (Functor). A functor F : C → D is a map from
category C to category D that associates each object A in C
an object F(A) in D; and each map f : A → B in C a map
F( f ) : F(A) → F(B) in D, such that F(1A ) = 1F(A) for each
object A in C; and F(g ◦C f ) = F(g) ◦D F( f ) for all maps
f : A → B and g : B → C, where ◦C and ◦D are compositions
in categories C and D.
Two examples of functors, used in the construction of products, are the diagonal and product functors. The diagonal
functor ∆ : C → C × C; A 7→ (A, A), f 7→ ( f , f ) sends objects
and arrows to pairs of objects and arrows. The product functor Π : C × C → C; (A, B) 7→ A × B, ( f , g) 7→ f × g send pairs
of objects and arrows to their respective products.
Definition (Universal morphism/construction). Given a
functor F : A → C and an object Y ∈ |C|, a universal morphism from F to Y is a pair (A, φ) where A is an object in A,
and φ is a morphism in C, such that for every object Z ∈ |A|
and every morphism f : F(Z) → Y , there exists a unique morphism u : Z → A, such that φ ◦ F(u) = f , as indicated in commutative diagram

A universal construction is a universal morphism, or its dual
a couniversal morphism, obtained by reversing the directions
of the arrows in the definition of universal morphism.
A product (A × B, (p1 , p2 )) is an instance of a universal
morphism, hence a universal construction, and indicated in
