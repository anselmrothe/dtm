Definition (Functor). A functor F : C → D is a map from
category C to category D that associates each object A in C
an object F(A) in D; and each map f : A → B in C a map
F( f ) : F(A) → F(B) in D, such that F(1A ) = 1F(A) for each
object A in C; and F(g ◦C f ) = F(g) ◦D F( f ) for all maps
 f : A → B and g : B → C, where ◦C and ◦D are compositions
in categories C and D.
    Two examples of functors, used in the construction of prod-
ucts, are the diagonal and product functors. The diagonal
functor ∆ : C → C × C; A 7→ (A, A), f 7→ ( f , f ) sends objects
and arrows to pairs of objects and arrows. The product func-
tor Π : C × C → C; (A, B) 7→ A × B, ( f , g) 7→ f × g send pairs
of objects and arrows to their respective products.
Definition (Universal morphism/construction). Given a
functor F : A → C and an object Y ∈ |C|, a universal mor-
phism from F to Y is a pair (A, φ) where A is an object in A,
and φ is a morphism in C, such that for every object Z ∈ |A|
and every morphism f : F(Z) → Y , there exists a unique mor-
phism u : Z → A, such that φ ◦ F(u) = f , as indicated in com-

A universal construction is a universal morphism, or its dual
a couniversal morphism, obtained by reversing the directions
of the arrows in the definition of universal morphism.
    A product (A × B, (p1 , p2 )) is an instance of a universal
morphism, hence a universal construction, and indicated in
