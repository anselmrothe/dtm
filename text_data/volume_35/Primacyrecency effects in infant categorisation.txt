model’s predictions. The question naturally arises on how
precisely the model’s behavior and infant behavior parallel
each other. We address this question by considering looking
time throughout familiarization/training. As we will see in
the next section, infant looking time decreases throughout the
familiarization phase in the low-distance condition while re-
maining stable in the high distance condition. However, the
original model does not exhibit this kind of behavior. In order
to achieve this behavior in the model we have to add two ele-
ments to the learning mechanism : (i) a form of weight decay:
the weights associated to the maps’ units that are not involved
in training (because they are not selected as the best matching
unit) slowly decay towards the initial values, and (ii) a form
of habituation: the learning rate decreases if the same unit is               Figure 2: Looking time during familiarization.
the best match over multiple trials. With these two new ele-
ments, the network looking time mimics infant looking time
also in the familiarization phase.

females) took part in this study. An additional 31 infants were
