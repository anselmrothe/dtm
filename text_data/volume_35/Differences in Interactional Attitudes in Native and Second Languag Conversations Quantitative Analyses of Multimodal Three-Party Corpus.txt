Abstract
Quantitative analyses and the analyses of a questionnaire
were conducted to examine the relations between participants’
communicative activities and their interactional attitudes in
conversations both in their native and second languages. The
two categories of conversations revealed different gaze
patterns that reflected the differences in difficulties they had
with communication and grounding patterns. The participants
were less conscious of their own gazes in conversation in
their second language than those in their native language
probably because of the difficulties and mental pressure they
felt.
Keywords: Second language conversation; Language
expertise; Utterance; Gaze; Grounding; Communication

Introduction
As modern society has become more global, the
importance of conversations in a second language has been
increasing more than ever before. People are traveling
around the world either on business or for pleasure due to
progress in transportation systems and advanced Internet
technologies that connect areas that have different linguistic
backgrounds. Organizations are increasingly forming teams
with members whose mother tongues are not the same, and
sometimes co-workers and collaborators from different
countries are connected via the Internet. Second language
conversations are commonly observed in daily life, and the
expertise of conversational participants often ranges from
low to high. An urgent issue today is to support mutual
understanding in these conversations.

Language use is a form of joint action that is carried out
by groups of people who act in coordination. Their joint
action involves not only verbal but also non-verbal activities
to achieve a common "grounding" process, i.e., to form the
basis of mutual understanding (Clark & Brennan 1991,
Clark 1996). There have been quantitative studies that have
reported that eye gazes play an important role in monitoring
understanding by communication partners of the content of
conversation and contributions made to the performance of
collaborative tasks (Boyle, Anderson, & Newlands 1994,
Clark & Krych 2004).
Grounding is also an important process in second
languages. There have been studies that have regarded
"nativeness" as "expertise" and compared the grounding
process between differing levels of language expertise
(Kasper 2004, Hosoda 2006). Hosoda reported that
participants' disfluencies or linguistic errors were usually
not treated as problems with interactions, but they were
oriented to differences in linguistic expertise by repair (a)
when one speaker invited the other's repair, and (b) when
mutual understanding was jeopardized unless one party
repaired the other. Eye gazes and facial expressions play an
important role in monitoring both partners’ understanding in
the repair process. These studies have, however, been
qualitative and there have been few quantitative analyses of
the relation between the grounding process and non-verbal
activities in second language conversations.
Veinott et al. (1999) found that non-native speaker pairs
benefited from video in route guiding tasks in the field of
computer supported collaborative work (CSCW), whereas
native speaker pairs did not. They argued that this was

3823

bbecause videoo helped the non-native ppairs to negottiate a
ccommon grouund whereas it did not do so for the nativee pairs.
T
Their study reevealed that video
v
images of the converrsation
ppartners helpeed them to esstablish mutuaal understandiing in
ttheir second language connversations, allthough it waas still
nnot clear w
which elemennt in the vvideo inform
mation
ccontributed too establishing the
t common gground.
Previous rresearch has suggested soome differencces in
cconversationaal features beetween a motther tongue aand a
ssecond languaage. The duraation as a perccentage when other
pparticipants arre observing thhe speaker in English as a second
llanguage is loonger than thaat in Japanese as a mother toongue
((Kabashima, Nishida,
N
Jokinnen, Yamamotto 2012; Yam
masaki,
F
Furukawa, N
Nishida, Jokinnen, Yamam
moto 2012). Even
tthough thesee results arre consistentt with Hossoda’s
oobservations and suggest an
a interestingg feature of second
llanguage com
mmunications,, it is still nnot clear how
w this
ffeature interaccts with other communicativve features.
The main aaim of this stuudy was to exxamine the rellations
bbetween partiicipants’ com
mmunicative aactivities and their
iinteractional attitudes
a
in coonversations bboth in their nnative
aand second laanguages. We conducted quuantitative anaalyses
tto study the differences iin communiccative behavioors in
ssecond and native langguage converrsations. We also
aanalyzed a questionnaire to examinee the interacctional
aattitudes of thhe participants. We integrateed the results of the
ttwo analyses to examine thhe differencess in communiccation
pprocesses in nnative and secoond language cconversations.

Data C
Collection
We collecteed data in a mother tonguue and in a second
llanguage from
m conversationns by the samee interlocutors.

P
Participantss
A total of tw
wenty-four unniversity studennts (14 femalees and
10 males: eigght groups) bbetween the aages of 18 annd 24
pparticipated iin the experiiment, and eeach conversaational
ggroup consistted of three participants w
who did not know
aanother. Theyy were Japaneese universityy students whho had
aacquired Japaanese as their mother tonguue and had leearned
E
English as a ssecond languaage. Their com
mmunication levels
iin English weere measured bbased on the Test of English for
IInternational Communicaation (TOEIC
C). We reccruited
pparticipants too cover widee range of exxpertise in Ennglish.
T
Their scores ranged
r
from 4450 to 890, annd the averagge was
5591 (990 beinng the highesst score that could be attaained).
E
Each participaant was rankeed into three degrees
d
of exppertise
aaccording to tthe order of hiis/her Englishh expertise bassed on
tthe TOEIC score within thee group.

E
Experimenttal Setup
Three particcipants sat in a triangular formation arounnd one
ttable. Each paarticipant sat in the same pposition for alll four
ttrials. The thrree participantts sat 1.5 m aapart. Three sets
s of
N
NAC EMR-9 eye trackers and headsetss with micropphones
w
were used to record the eyye gazes and voices of all three
pparticipants (F
Figure 1). Thhe viewing anngle of the EMR-9

wass 62o and the sampling ratee was 60 fps. The participaants
talkked about twoo types of preddetermined thhemes in Engllish
as a second languuage and in Jaapanese as theiir mother tonggue
(e.gg., each group participated in four converssations).

Analysis 3: Correlations between Gazing Activities
and Values from Questionnaire
These results indicate that the participants gazing
activities and interactional attitudes differed in
conversations in their native and second languages, as had
been predicted. We conducted Spearman’s correlation
analysis on their gazing activities and their interactional
attitudes that were contained in the questionnaire data. The
items that exhibited significant correlation are shown with
the correlation values (Spearman's ρ) in the following tables.
A single asterisk * denotes p < .05 and a double asterisk
denotes p < .01on the tables.
Consciousness of Gazing Activities:
The values obtained from evaluating gazing activities had
high correlations with gaze durations in Japanese
conversations although they did not in English
conversations. These results indicate that the participants
were conscious of their gazing activities in conversations in
their native language, whereas they were not in their second
language.

Analysis 4: Correlations of Items on Questionnaire
There were several interesting differences in the results
from Spearman’s correlation analysis of the items in the
questionnaire for the Japanese and English conversations as
listed below.
Difference in Interactional Attitudes
The speakers’ evaluations of their ability to concentrate
were correlated with their evaluations of gazing at the
listeners’ upper body, face, and eyes in English, but only
with their evaluations of gazing at the listener’s eyes in
Japanese. This suggest that speakers were paying attention
to wider areas of their partners’ body when they
concentrated during second language conversations,
whereas they were only paying attention to the eyes of their
partners in native language conversations. .
English:
Did you concentrate on your utterances?
<-> Did you watch the listener's upper body as

Feelings toward Other Participants
The participants evaluations of their understanding of
their partners’ discourse were correlated with those of their
positive feelings toward their partners in English
conversations, whereas there were no such correlations in
Japanese conversations. The participants tended to have
positive feelings toward their partners when they could
understand what their partners said in second language
conversations, but just understanding their partners’
discourse was not enough for the participants to have
positive feelings toward their partners in native language
conversations.

The participants’ evaluations of pressure from their

nervousness when they spoke in English conversations but
not in Japanese conversations. This suggested that pressure
from their partners led directly to the speakers’ nervousness
in second language conversations, but not in native language
conversations.

Discussion
Thus far, we have compared the utterances, gazes, and
interactional attitudes of participants in native and second
language conversations. Quantitative analyses were
conducted on utterance and gaze data in Analysis 1. The
shorter total duration in English conversations suggested
difficulties the participants had in their second language
conversations. Preliminary analysis using one-fourth of this
corpus denoted that the average number of filled pauses and
percentage of turn-hold after pause were more than double
in English in comparison with those in Japanese (Yamasaki,
Furukawa, Nishida, Jokinen, Yamamoto 2012). These
results also suggested difficulties the participants had in
their second language conversations.
The speakers were observed by listeners more in their
second language conversations than in their native language

3827

conversations. The speakers with lower levels of linguistic
expertise were gazed more than those with higher levels of
linguistic expertise in their second language conversations.
These results are consistent with observations by Hosoda
(Hosoda 2006), and they indicate that such gazing patterns
represent one of the interactional features unique to second
language conversations. The listeners made more use of
visual information from the speaker to help further
understanding in conversations in their second language
than that in their native language, and it is likely that
speakers with low levels of expertise need more gazes from
their partner to help their repair process in grounding
activities in second language conversations.
A comparison of the values obtained from the
questionnaire also revealed difficulties the participants had
in their second language conversations in Analysis 2. They
evaluated their linguistic expertise to be lower in their
second language conversations and they felt more pressure
from their partners, and were more nervous. They were not
able to conduct conversations as they usually did, and the
conversations did not warm up as much as those in their
native language.
The difficulties in second language conversations seemed
to have affected their management of conversational
activities. The results obtained from correlation analysis in
Analysis 3 of the participants’ gazes and their self
evaluations of their own gazes indicated that the participants
were not conscious of their gazing activities in
conversations in their second language, whereas they were
in their native language. This suggests that difficulties in
second language communication made the participants
concentrate too much on managing conversations to be
conscious of their own communicative activities.
Analysis of correlation in the items on the questionnaire
in Analysis 4 revealed differing interactional attitudes in
native and second language conversations. The speakers
seemed to make use of visual cues from wider areas of the
listeners’ upper bodies when they concentrated more on
their second language conversations than those in their
native language where they only made use of visual cues
from the listeners’ eyes.
Another interesting finding from Analysis 4 was that
understanding what a conversation partner said was likely to
lead to positive evaluation of the partner in conversations in
the second language whereas no such tendencies were
observed in conversations in the native language. This
suggests that understanding the partners’ utterances is
already considered to be an achievement in second language
conversations whereas just understanding what the partners
say is not enough to have positive feelings toward them.

Conclusion
We examined the relations between participants’
communicative activities and their interactional attitudes
both in native and second language conversations.
Quantitative analyses and analyses of a questionnaire
revealed that the participants had more difficulties in their

second language conversations than those in their native
language, and they demonstrated different interactional
attitudes in the two categories of conversations. .
Speakers were observed more by listeners in
conversations in their second language than those in their
native language, and speakers with lower levels of expertise
were observed more in second language conversations
which probably reflected more frequent repair processes.
The participants were less conscious of their gazing
activities in conversations in their second language than
those in their native language probably because of the
difficulties and pressures they felt in their second language
conversations. We trust these findings will contribute
further to supporting second language communications and
second language learning.
