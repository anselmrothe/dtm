whether an animal is a squirrel or a hamster, participants
predict a value of a given feature (e.g., the type of tail the
animal has).
There is evidence that classification and inference
learners result in different representations of categories and
much of these findings stem from a paradigm developed by
Yamauchi and A. Markman (1998). The paradigm is based
on the following idea. Imagine two categories A (labeled
“A”) and B (labeled “B”), each having four binary
dimensions (e.g., Size: large vs. small, Color: black vs.
white, Shape: square vs. circle, and Texture: smooth vs.
rough). The prototype of Category A has all values denoted
by “1” (i.e., “A”, 1, 1, 1, 1) and the prototype of Category
B has all values denoted by “0” (i.e., “B”, 0, 0, 0, 0). There
are two inter-related generalization tasks – classification
and inference. The goal of classification is to infer category
membership (and hence the label) on the basis of presented
features. For example, participants are presented with all
the values for an item (e.g., ?, 0, 1, 1, 1) and have to predict
category label “A” or “B”. In contrast, in the inference task
participants have to infer a feature on the basis of category
label and other presented features. For example, given an
item (e.g., “A”, 1, ?, 1, 0), participants have to predict the
value of the missing feature. It was found that inference
learners were more likely than classification learners to
infer prototypical features which were correspondingly
associated with training items. Multiple studies using this
paradigm found that classification learners are sensitive
primarily to diagnostic features that distinguish between
categories, whereas inference learners are also sensitive to
within-category correlations of features, which are not
diagnostic but prototypical (Chin-Parker & Ross, 2002;
Chin-Parker & Ross, 2004; Sakamoto & Love, 2006;
Yamauchi, Love, & A. Markman, 2002; Yamauchi & A.
Markman, 2000a, 2000b). Furthermore, there is also
evidence that adults trained on a classification task attend
to the most relevant features (A. L. Anderson et al., 2002).
Adults learn to optimize performance in category learning
by shifting their attention to different diagnostic features in
different situations (Nosofsky, 1984; Rehder & Hoffman,
2005; Shepard et al., 1961) or learn inattention to newly
relevant features (Hoffman & Rehder, 2010).
The argument that classification learning focuses on the
diagnostic features distinguishing categories whereas

Abstract
What information do people extract in the course of category
learning? And how does training affect this process? The
current study addressed these questions by examining the
effects of training on the outcome of category learning in 4to 5-year-olds and adults. In two experiments, participants
were trained on either a classification task or an inference
task and then tested with categorization and recognition
tasks. The categorical information (i.e., deterministic and
probabilistic features) was explicitly given to participants in
Experiment 1 but not in Experiment 2. Results with adults
replicate previous findings indicating that participants form
different representations in the course of classification and
inference training (rule-based representation in the former
case and similarity-based representations in the latter case).
In contrast, regardless of the type of training, young children
form similarity-based representations.

Introduction
The ability to form categories is an important component
of human cognition (see Murphy, 2002, for a review). It
has been well established that this ability appears early in
development, with young infants capable of forming
categories (Eimas & Quinn, 1994; Oakes, Madole, &
Cohen, 1991). The study of how categories are learned and
used can elucidate “a single main theme to cognitive
science – the question of how people come to have
knowledge” (Murphy, 2002, p. 272).
The relationship between category learning and use can
be examined by contrasting two of the fundamental
functions of categories – classification and inference (E.
Smith, 1994). To test theories of categorization, researchers
developed a variety of tasks (see A. Markman & Ross,
2003, for a review), most of which are based on
classification. In a typical classification learning task,
participants are presented with stimuli, whose category
membership is unknown, and are asked to predict a
category each item belongs to. This situation is similar to
that of sorting a set of squirrels and hamsters into two
distinct groups. Whereas classification involves predicting
the category of an item, inference involves predicting a
missing feature using information from other features as
well as the category. In this case, instead of determining

2166

inference learning focuses on the prototypical features
reflecting within-category information is consistent with
the evidence that adults’ categorization is often rule-based
(Rips, 1989; Allen & Brooks, 1991). Nosofsky and
colleagues (Nosofsky & Palmeri, 1998; Nosofsky, Palmeri,
McKinley, 1994) have proposed a quantitative model of
human concept learning that learns to classify objects by
forming simple logical rules and remembering occasional
exceptions to those rules.
However, there is little agreement on the categorization
process in early development. According to knowledgebased approaches, early in development, categorization and
inductive generalization is considered to be based on prior
categorical knowledge thus to be category based (Gelman
& E. Markman, 1986; Gelman & Heyman, 1999; Gelman
2004). According to another approach, early categorization
is similarity-based (Sloutsky & Fisher, 2004; Sloutsky,
Kloos, & Fisher, 2007). There is evidence that early
generalization is often driven by appearance similarity
(Gelman, 1988; Gelman & E. Markman, 1987; Sloutsky &
Fisher, 2004). In particular, infants are more likely to group
items together if the items have overlapping within-group
distributions of properties and non-overlapping betweengroup distributions (French, et al., 2004, see also Mareschal
& Quinn, 2001; Mareschal, Quinn, & French, 2002).
Similarly, infants are more likely to generalize non-obvious
properties when the two items look alike (Welder &
Graham, 2001) and they are more likely to extend a name
to items that have similar shape (E. Markman &
Hutchinson, 1984; L. Smith, et al., 1996). Similar results
have been reported with young children, with similarity
supporting both categorization of items and induction of
non-obvious properties (Gelman, 1988; Gelman & E.
Markman, 1987; Sloutsky & Fisher, 2004; Sloutsky & Lo,
1999).
Do children and adults show the same pattern of
extracting and processing categorical information in
category learning? How does training affect this process?
And how do these effects change in the course of
development? Does the asymmetry between classification
and inference learning found in adults exist in children?
Finding such an asymmetry would support the idea that,
like adults, children treat classification and inference
learning differently and tend to detect and rely on a
defining feature to categorize items, whereas a symmetric
performance in the classification and inference training
would support the idea that children may perform
similarity-based categorization and treat two types of
category learning equally. The primary goal of this study is
to address these questions.

of a given item (in classification training) or a feature that
the item has (in inference training). The testing phase
consisted of categorization and recognition tasks and was
administered immediately after the training phase. During
the testing phase, which was identical for two training
conditions, adult and child participants were asked to
determine (1) which category the creature was more likely
to belong to and (2) whether each picture was old or new.
The structures of both training and testing stimuli will be
described in the section below.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants There were 35 adults (16 women) and 21
preschool children (M = 56.6 months, range 53.2–59.5
months; 13 girls) participating in this experiment. In this
and the second experiment reported here, adult participants
were undergraduate students from the Ohio State
University participating for course credit and were tested in
a quiet room in our lab on campus. Child participants were
recruited from childcare centers, located in middle-class
suburbs of Columbus and were tested in a quiet room in
their preschool by a female experimenter.
Materials In both experiments reported here, the materials,
similar to those used previously by Deng and Sloutsky
(2012, 2013), consisted of colorful drawings of artificial
creatures that varied in their appearance and in a categoryinclusion rule and that were accompanied by the novel
labels "flurp" (Category F) and "jalet" (Category J). For
these two categories, we created two prototypes (F0 and J0,
respectively) that were distinct in the color and shape of
seven of their features: head, body, hands, feet, antennae,
tail, and button (see Figure 1). Two categories have a
family-resemblance structure and stimuli were derived
from the two prototypes by modifying the values of the
seven features. The button is the deterministic feature
(hereafter “D”) and defines the category-inclusion rule: all
members of Category F have raindrop-shaped button with
the value of 1 whereas all members of Category J have
cross-shaped button with the value of 0. All the other
varying features – the head, body, hands, feet, antennae,
and tail – constitute the probabilistic features (hereafter
“P”) and reflect the overall similarity among the exemplars.
The training stimuli consisted of High-Match items (i.e.,
PflurpDflurp and PjaletDjalet). All members of PflurpDflurp items
had four probabilistic features (P) consistent with the
prototype F0 with the value of 1 and two features
consistent with the prototype J0 with the value of 0. And
all of them have the deterministic feature (D) consistent
with F0 valued 1. However, all members of PjaletDjalet items
had four probabilistic features consistent with the prototype
J0 with the value of 0 and two features consistent with the
prototype F0 with the value of 1. And all of them have the
deterministic feature consistent with J0 valued 0.
The testing stimuli consisted of another four sets of items
besides the High-Match items. The data analyses reported

Overview of the Current Study
Experiments reported here explored how categories were
learned and used under classification and inference training
by adults and young children. The basic task consisted of
two phases, a training phase and a testing phase. During the
training phase, participants had to infer either the category

here only focused on two of them: critical lures (i.e.,
PjaletDflurp and PflurpDjalet), and all-new-P items (i.e., PallnewDflurp and Pall-newDjalet). The High-Match items were used
to examine participants’ performance of category learning
and to assess their recognition accuracy on the old items.
Children were above 91.1% categorization accuracy on
these trials, and adults were above 95.3%, all above chance
(ps < .05) and exhibited memory accuracy of 82.2% and
94.5%, respectively. The all-new-P items were catch trials
and consisted of six new probabilistic features which were
not shown during training. Children and adults exhibited
memory accuracy of 91.0% and 98.1%, respectively. The
critical lures were Low-Match items: Most of the members
of PjaletDflurp items have the P with the value of 0 but all of
them have D valued 1; whereas most of the members of
PflurpDjalet items have P with the value of 1 but all of them
have D valued 0. This set of items was used to assess
whether participants relied on overall similarity or
category-inclusion rule to categorize new items. Table 1
shows example of category structure with P and D being
combined to create three types of stimuli, and Figure 1
shows examples of each kind of stimulus.
Procedure The procedure consisted of two phases, a
training phase and a testing phase. During the training
phase, participants were given 30 trials (15 trials per
category) and they had to infer either the category of a

given item (in classification training) or a feature that the
item has (in inference training). Each training trial was
accompanied by corrective feedback. The classification and
inference training differed in the type of dimensions being
predicted. In classification training, participants predicted
the category label of a stimulus given information about all
other features. In inference training, participants predicted
one missing feature of a stimulus given the information
about the remaining features as well as the label. The
information about P and D was explicitly given to
participants before training. They were told that all flurps
(or jalets) had raindrop button (or cross button) and most of
them had flurps’ (or jalets’) P by presenting corresponding
probabilistic features one at a time. This information was
repeated in the corrective feedback to each response during
training. Adult and child participants were randomly
assigned to one of the two training conditions. The testing
tasks were not mentioned in the training phase of any of the
conditions.
Testing phase, including categorization and recognition
tasks, was administered immediately after training. During
the testing phase, which was identical for two training
conditions, adult and child participants were presented with
40 trials of creatures and were asked to determine (1)
which category the creature was more likely to belong to
and (2) whether each picture was old (i.e., exactly the one

2168

Proportion of rule-based response

presented during the training phase) or new. The order of
the 40 items was randomized across participants. No
feedback was provided during the testing phase.
The procedures were identical for both adult and child
participants except the way the instructions were presented
and the questions were asked. Adult participants read the
instructions and questions on the computer screen and
pressed the keyboard to make responses, whereas for
children instructions as well as questions were presented
verbally by a trained experimenter and the experimenter
recorded children’s responses by pressing the keyboard.
The proportion of responses in accordance with the
category from which the exemplar was derived (i.e., rulebased responses) was the dependent variable. If
classification learners and inference learners process and
represent categorical information differently, their
performance should be asymmetric between Classification
Training and Inference Training conditions. However, if
there is no difference between classification and inference
training, participants should show symmetric pattern
between two training conditions. In addition, if participants
rely on the deterministic feature, the proportion of rulebased responses should be high. However, if they rely on
multiple probabilistic features, they should make low level
of rule-based response.

The results are consistent with previous evidence
(Yamauchi & A.Markman, 1998; Hoffman & Rehder,
2010) pointing to the predicted asymmetry between
classification and inference training for adults. As
predicted, adults tended to process and represent
categorical information differently, with classification
learners being more likely than inference learners to focus
on deterministic feature, which separates two categories.
However, there was little evidence that children learned
categories differently by classification and inference. The
symmetric performance suggested that children treated
classification training and inference training equally and,
more importantly, unlike adults, children formed similaritybased representation of categories.
One possible limitation of Experiment 1 was that
participants were told explicitly about the deterministic and
probabilistic features. It is possible that only adults, but not
children attended to this information, and as a result, only
adults formed rule-based representations. Experiment 2
attempted to eliminate this possibility by not mentioning
that there were probabilistic and deterministic features.

Results and Discussion
All results reported here only focused on performance of
the categorization task, specifically on the critical lures
(i.e., PflurpDjalet and PjaletDflurp items). Recall that if
participants form a rule-based representation of a category,
they should identify the PflurpDjalet item as a jalet, whereas if
they formed a similarity-based representation, they should
identify this item as a flurp.
The main results of Experiment 1 are shown in Figure 2.
As shown in the figure, children tended to form similaritybased representations regardless of condition, whereas
adults tended to form rule-based representations in the
classification condition. These findings were supported by
statistical analyses – data in the figure were analyzed with
2 (Training Type: Classification and Inference) by 2 (Age
Group: 4-5-year-olds vs. Adults) between-subjects
ANOVA. There was a main effect of training type, F(1,52)
= 5.56, MSE = 0.38, p = .022, η2 = 0.097, and a main effect
of age group, F(1,52) = 24.49, MSE = 1.65, p < .001, η2 =
0.320. Specifically, adults made more rule-based responses
in Classification Training than in Inference Training,
independent samples t(1,31.2) = 2.63, p = .013, d = 0.92,
with the proportion of rule-based responses above chance
in Classification Training, one-sample t(1,15) = 4.28, p =
.001, d = 1.07, but around chance in Inference Training,
one-sample t(1,18) = 0.94, p = .359. However, for children,
they made comparable rule-based responses in both
training conditions (p = .334), with the proportion of rulebased responses significantly below chance in Inference
Training, one-sample t(1,6) = 5.46, p = .002, d = 2.06, and
marginally below chance in Classification Training, onesample t(1,13) = 2.03, p =.064, d = 0.54.

Experiment 2
Method
Participants Twenty-six adults (18 women) and twenty
preschool children (M = 55.3 months, range 49.8–60.2
months; 7 girls) participated in this experiment. Two
additional adults were texting during experiments and these
data were excluded from the analysis.
Materials and procedure The materials were identical to
those used in Experiment 1. The overall procedure in
Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1 except that
neither the information of P nor D was given to participants
before main experiment or in the feedback (i.e.,
participants were only given corrective feedback). For the
old items (i.e., High-Match items) at test, children were
above 70.1% categorization accuracy on these trials, and
adults were above 83.9%, all above chance (ps < .05) and
exhibited memory accuracy of 75.0% and 71.1%,
respectively. For the all-new-P items, Children and adults
exhibited memory accuracy of 78.2% and 82.2%,
respectively.

Two major findings stem from the reported results. First,
in both reported experiments adults exhibited an
asymmetric pattern between classification training and
inference training. Their rule-based responses in
classification training were consistently higher than those
in inference training, which is consistent with previous
evidence (Yamauchi & A. Markman, 1998; Hoffman &
Rehder, 2010) suggesting that adults process and represent
categorical
information
differently.
Specifically,
classification learners are more likely to focus on
deterministic (or rule-based) features than inference
learners. However, for young children, the symmetry
between classification and inference suggests that they do
not treat these two training conditions differently. Second,
adults tend to spontaneously detect a defining feature
(Experiment 2) and classification learners tend to
consistently rely on it to categorize items (Experiment 1
and 2). But there is little evidence that children rely on the
deterministic feature in categorization. In contrast to adults,
children tend to rely on a pattern of correlated probabilistic
features, which reflects the overall similarity.
The results have implications for understanding the
mechanisms underlying category learning and how these
mechanisms may change in the course of development.
Future research will also examine how attention is
allocated in category learning by using a combination of
eye tracking and behavioral paradigm.

Results and Discussion
The main results of Experiment 2 are shown in Figure 3.
The data were analyzed with 2 (Training Type:
Classification and Inference) by 2 (Age Group: 4-5-yearolds vs. Adults) between-subjects ANOVA. The results
revealed a significant training type by age group
interaction, F(1,42) = 16.48, MSE = 0.64, p = .001, η2 =
0.282. Independent samples t test indicated that adults
made more rule-based responses in Classification Training
than in Inference Training, t(1,24) = 6.14, p = .001, d =
2.58, with the proportion of rule-based responses above
chance in Classification Training, one-sample t(1,9) = 4.95,
p = .001, d = 1.56, but below chance in Inference Training,
one-sample t(1,15) = 2.30, p = .036, d = 0.57. However,
children exhibited comparable proportions of rule-based
responses in both training conditions (p = .604), with the
proportion of rule-based responses around chance in
Classification Training (p = .125) and Inference Training (p
= .140).
The results in Experiment 2 revealed the same pattern as
Experiment 1. For adults, there was an asymmetry between
classification and inference training; whereas young
children’s performance in the two training conditions was
symmetric, and, regardless of the training condition, they
formed similarity-based representations.

General Discussion
The reported study examines the effects of training on
the outcome of category learning and changes in these
effects in the course of development. To achieve this goal,
we trained adult and child participants with a category
learning task in which participants learned two categories.
Each category had a single deterministic feature that
differed between the categories and multiple probabilistic
features that partially overlapped between categories.
Participants who were trained on a classification task were
asked to classify items into one of two categories; whereas
participants who were trained on an inference task were
asked to infer a missing feature of items. Following
training, participants were tested on their ability to
categorize novel items.
