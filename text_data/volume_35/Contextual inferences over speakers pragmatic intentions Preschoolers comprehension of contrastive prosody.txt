picture depicted an okapi). Notice that this manipulation is
done based on the assumption that the Noun-focus prosody
is in principle semantically ambiguous and it can be inter-
preted as it is an X or It is not an X depending on a speaker’s
preference and a context (Kurumada, Brown, & Tanenhaus,
2012). It is hypothesized that children can better distinguish
the pragmatic intentions based on these formal cues due to
their reliance on lexically encoded information over prosodi-
cally encoded information in online processing (Snedeker &
Trueswell, 2003).
   Finally, in the Combined condition, the puppet used [It’s
an X] for a hint with Noun-focus prosody, and Verb-focus
prosody (e.g., “It LOOKS like an X”) for a warning. Recall           Figure 6: Proportions of an mentioned animal chosen by 4-

tion to pick out a familiar object) results in higher confidence
in a novel mapping compared to a situation in which there is
no such familiar association. Experiment 3 tests if children
can discover pragmatic meaning of contrastive prosody via
a similar pragmatic inference: In the Combined condition,
compared to the Prosody-Only condition, “It LOOKS like an
x” becomes a more likely candidate for conveying the [it is
not an X] meaning because speaker should otherwise have
said “It’s an X” if she had meant that.
