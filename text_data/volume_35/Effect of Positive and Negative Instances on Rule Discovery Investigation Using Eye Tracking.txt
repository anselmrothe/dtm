that participants did not often change their hypotheses even if
they faced inconsistent evidence. The second explanation is
based on attentional learning. The attentional learning model
(e.g., EXIT; Kruschke, 2003) explains eye movement data in
category learning according to the following process. First,
participants learn the relevant features that should be focused
on and irrelevant features that should be ignored. Positive
feedback to their learned rule reinforces their focus on the
learned features. On the other hand, if they face negative
feedback, they shift their focus from the learned relevant fea-
tures to other features. On the basis of this model, the par-
ticipants in this study would also shift their focus from the
learned initial perspective to other perspectives when they                                          !"#$%&! !'()%*&!

instances, they again focus on the initial perspective; as a re-
