   Together, these results support the idea that the judgment
of association strength task is sensitive to normed associa-
tive strength, and closely replicates the previous findings of
(Maki, 2007). However, our main goal was to investigate
whether continued responses lead to better approximations
of judged strength. Our findings support this hypotheses, but
only for weak or moderate strengths. Since no large-scale
studies have looked at the effect of continued associations,
the next section will go into detail about which mechanisms
might cause these results.

ficult predicting associative strength whether this strength is
based on FS1 or FS2 . New pilot studies seem to support this
entropy interaction. However, there are number of reasons
why sampling restrictions cannot completely explain the ob-
served response distributions for continued responses. First
of all, this does not explain why the heterogeneity or entropy
increases when more than one response per cue is asked. Sec-
ond, it might be the case that for different response positions,
distinct types of semantic information becomes available.
