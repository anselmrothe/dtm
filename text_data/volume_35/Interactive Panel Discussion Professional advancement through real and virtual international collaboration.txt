  Women in Cognitive Science (WICS) was founded in
2001 by Judith Kroll (Penn State), Randi Martin (Rice
University), and Suparna Rajaram (Stony Brook) with NSF
ADVANCE Funds. From 2007 onwards, Laurie Feldman
(Albany) and Janet van Hell (Penn State) have assumed a
leadership role within the group. In 2012, Natasha Tokowitz
joined the group.
  Partial funding for this event comes from NSF Award
