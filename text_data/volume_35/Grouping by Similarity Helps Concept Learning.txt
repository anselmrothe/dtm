ferences, see also (Carvalho & Goldstone, 2012; Kornell &            Intelligence community.
Bjork, 2008; Kang & Pashler, 2012). Additionally, compar-
ing very similar instances from different categories has the
advantage that there are fewer random, irrelevant differences
that compete for attention with the defining difference (see
Winston, 1970, on “near misses”).
   In summary, the two lines of arguments described above
predict that high similarity supports between-category com-
parison, while low similarity supports within-category com-
parison. Both types of comparisons are potentially impor-
tant in learning concepts, but one might be more effective
than the other for a specific learning task, depending on the
specific task, context, experience, and structure of concepts
(Goldstone, 1996).
   In this paper, we compare the effect that similarity has
on learning performance in blocked and interleaved presenta-
tion schedules. Carvalho and Goldstone (2012) recently con-
ducted an experiment with a similar purpose. They manip-             Figure 1: PBP 08. The task is to identify the two concepts A

   Our approach is different in three important ways. First,
