on a 6-point, Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (Strongly

performance-orientation scores were created by averaging
the two responses on each subscale (Elliot & Church, 1997).
                            Results
We examined the relationship between mastery and
performance orientation and learning in the two tutoring
conditions. We also examined children’s problem-solving
strategies during tutoring. We used hierarchical linear
regression for all analyses. The predictors in the model were
mastery orientation score, performance orientation score,
condition (dummy-coded), and two interaction terms
(Condition × Mastery Orientation, Condition × Performance
Orientation). Preliminary analyses showed no significant
two-way interactions between mastery and performance
orientation, or three-way interaction with condition, so they
were not included in the final model. Thus, the final model                  Figure 1. Conceptual and Procedural Knowledge

At retention test, the condition term was not significant (B
=.02; Figure 1). A Mastery Orientation × Condition
interaction emerged (B =.12, SE=.06, p=.036). Higher
mastery orientation was associated with a trend towards
higher procedural knowledge in the solve-first condition (B
=.07, SE=.04, p=.118), whereas it was associated with a
trend towards poorer procedural knowledge in the instruct-
first condition (B =-.05, SE=.04, p=.159).
   A significant Performance Orientation × Condition
interaction also emerged (B=-.11, SE=.05, p=.041; Figure
1). Higher performance orientation was associated with
lower procedural knowledge in the solve-first condition
(B=-.09, SE=.04, p=.035) but was unrelated to procedural
knowledge in the instruct-first condition (B=.02). Higher
performance orientation reduced gains in procedural
knowledge from exploration.
Performance during Tutoring Intervention
To provide further insight into how the knowledge
acquisition observed at retention test may have emerged, we
examined the problem-solving strategies children used                      Figure 2. Strategy Use during Tutoring Session
