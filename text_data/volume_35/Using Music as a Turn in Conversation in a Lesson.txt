Delayed interruption
We have previously noted that in a music lesson, where a ver-
bal request by the tutor is usually followed by a musical re-
sponse, it is reasonable to assume that this musical phrase is
analogous to a conversational turn, and we should therefore
be able to see the characteristics of turn management (Duffy
& Healey, 2012). The tutor will often interrupt the student’s
playing once a problem has been detected. However rather
than stop them as soon as the error has occurred, the end of a
musical phrase is preferred by the tutor as a TRP to take the
turn, even if they have detected the problem earlier. During
the short period of time between detection and interruption,
                                                                                  Figure 8: The tutor delays interruption

ular section and the tutor has decided that they will practice
it together. She picks up her clarinet and demonstrates the
phrase in full at a steady pace, as they both read from the stu-
dent’s score (Figure 9). The tutor bounces her clarinet bell
to emphasis the rhythm of the phrase and briefly glances at
the student, who is still looking at the score. He starts to nod
in time with her clarinet bell, signalling his attention to the
demonstration in response to the tutor’s checking glance.
