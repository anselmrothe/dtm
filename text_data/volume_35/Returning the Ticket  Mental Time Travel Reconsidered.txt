Mental Time Travel (MTT) is, roughly, an individual’s capacity to project herself into the past or future by
remembering or imagining first-personal experiences respectively. MTT is further presumed to have a
distinct, concrete though dispersed neural correlate, and hence describes a neuro-cognitive
phenomenon.
Opening with a brief sketch of the development and current state of the art, the essay pursues three
central aims: Firstly, it constitutes a plea for more conceptual rigour on the cognitive side of the fence,
so as to ensure that meaningful lessons can be drawn from neurological enquiry about it. Secondly, a
partial conceptual qualification of the necessary requirements of MTT as traditionally conceived is
proposed, as they seem vague, uninformative and arbitrary. Finally, a revision of MTT is attempted,
which aspires to include a variety of mental states so far not associated with MTT. MTT, as it is currently
defined and investigated, I will argue, stands too heavily in the genealogical debt of research into
episodic memory, and suffers from an astonishing neglect of considerations pertaining to imagination.
