IPSOM Modeling of Delusions
According to Spitzer (1995a), a decisive factor in the
clinical phenomenon of acute delusions is the level of
cortical neuromodulator activity; this affects modulation of
signal-to-noise ratio. In a SOM model of delusions it is
possible to regulate the level of neuronal activation focusing
associated with the signal-to-noise ratio by controlling SOM
lateral inhibition. This can be achieved by controlling the
width of TN during SOM formation. TN can be regarded as
the “source of power” (Sun & Ling, 1997) in this model.
   Similar to the autistic model, the working hypothesis is                         A. Untrained           B. Oscillating TN width σ0=1.15
that the initial TN width (σ0) in the TN width function
affects the map’s behavior in a way applicable to Spitzer’s
theory. Inducing acute delusions in IPSOM can be realized
via modifying the cooperation phase of the SOM algorithm
in the model to employ a significant TN narrowing.
   A series of groups of controlled simulations were
executed with the initial width of the TN function set to a
typical value of σ0=3 for one group, and reduced to σ0=1.15
for another group, as in the autistic model. Both groups
