Abstract
Speakers of morphologically-rich languages commonly face
what has been called the Paradigm Cell Filling Problem: they
know some form of a word but it is inappropriate to the
current context, leading them to derive a form of that word
they have never encountered (e.g., they know the singular
form of a noun, and now need to produce the plural). We
suggest that in performing this task speakers perseverate on
articulatory gestures comprising the form they know, and that
gestures vary in the extent to which speakers perseverate on
them. This proposal explains the parallels between findings in
loanword adaptation, speech errors, and acquisition of
phonology. New experimental data from a miniature artificial
language are presented in support of the theory.
Keywords: Phonology; morphology; speech production;
inductive bias; faithfulness; Harmonic Grammar.

Theory
In a seminal paper arguing for substantive bias in the
acquisition of phonology, Wilson (2006) defines
"substance" as "any aspect of grammar that has its basis in
the physical properties of speech. These properties include
articulatory inertias, aerodynamic pressures, and degrees of
auditory salience and distinctiveness" (p. 946). In other
words, substance in phonology is phonetics. The
Substantive Bias Hypothesis suggests that the learner of
phonology is predisposed towards acquiring patterns that
are phonetically natural. Phonetically unnatural patterns are
learnable and can therefore be productive in natural
languages (Mielke, 2008; Ohala, 1978) but the learner needs
more evidence to be convinced of their reality (Wilson,
2006).
A natural phonological alternation can be defined as an
articulatorily and/or perceptually minimal change in a
context where it can result from coarticulation, articulatory
undershoot, and/or misperception. For instance, the velar
stop [k] might become [tʃ] before [i] because the
coarticulation between [k] and [i] causes [k] to front
(becoming [kj]), resulting in [kji], which is easy to

misperceive as [tʃi] in noise (Guion, 1998). There are
therefore multiple ways in which a phonological alternation
can be phonetically unnatural.
First, it might happen in the "wrong" context. If it
happens in the wrong context, it also might not happen in
the "right" context, making it even more unnatural. For
instance, palatalization might happen before [o] without
happening before [i] (Kapatsinski, 2010) despite [ko] and
[tʃo] being acoustically and articulatorily quite distinct
whereas [kji] and [tʃi] are very similar. Context naturalness
has been investigated experimentally by Mitrovic (2012),
Schane et al. (1975), and Wilson (2006), among others.
Second, the change itself might be unnatural. For
instance, Ohala (1978) shows that Southern Bantu changes
[p] into [tʃ] without changing [k] into [tʃ].1 The articulatory
difference between [p] and [tʃ] is articulatorily greater than
the one between [k] and [tʃ]. Nonetheless, [p] changes into
[tʃ] in Southern Bantu whereas [k] does not. The influence
of change naturalness on learnability has only now begun to
receive attention (Kapatsinski 2012b, White 2012). In
demonstrating an effect of change naturalness, we provide
additional evidence for the existence of substantive bias
(contra Blevins, 2004; Hale & Reiss, 2000; and Ohala, 1990
among others).
How can change naturalness influence learnability? We
propose that it is through perseveration in speech
production. Consider a speaker who knows one form of a
word (say, a singular) and wants to come up with another
form of the same word (say, a plural). We propose that in
producing the unknown wordform the speaker is likely to
perseverate on the articulatory units of the known wordform
(Kapatsinski, 2013). This perseveration is usually
functional, in that most, if not all, of the known form should
be in the to-be-produced unknown form. This type of
perseveration may help humans avoid bizarrely unfaithful
1

The Southern Bantu alternation context is also unnatural:
palatalization happens before [w] rather than a front vowel (Ohala,
1978).

mappings like mail-membled, demonstrated by Rumelhart &
McClelland's (1986) model of English past tense formation,
which lacks perseveration and is fully empowered to learn
arbitrary present-past pairings. However, when the mapping
between the known form and the to-be-produced form
involves a stem change, perseveration on the to-be-produced
form can result in error, where the stem change is leveled
(or at least partially leveled). For instance, Kapatsinski
(2009) showed that subjects who are exposed to a miniature
artificial language with velar palatalization (ktʃ before the
plural suffix -i) often make errors in which [k] becomes
[ktʃ] rather than [tʃ] before -i (e.g., floʊkfloʊktʃi rather
than floʊkfloʊtʃi), erroneously retaining the final
consonant of the known form.
We propose that articulatory units differ in how much
they are subject to perseveration. These differences in
perseverance (susceptibility to perseveration) act as biases,
causing learners to level stem changes that involve changing
a unit that is highly susceptible to perseveration. 2 Further,
the greater the articulatory difference between the known
form and the to-be-produced form, the more likely the
change is to fail, or at least be carried out incompletely,
since every one of the articulatory units present in the
known form can (erroneously) persevere. Note that this is
not a bias against all uncommon changes. Some changes
may be uncommon for perceptual reasons, but we do not
have any evidence to suggest that perceptual magnitude of a
change influences its learnability (cf. Steriade, 2001 for a
suggestion that it does). There is one published study that
examined the relationship between change naturalness and
learnability, and failed to find one: Wilson (2006) observed
that [k]-->[tʃ] and [g]-->[dʒ] did not differ in learnability
despite [ki] and [tʃi] being more perceptually confusable
than [gi] and [dʒi] (Guion, 1998). The present hypothesis is
consistent with this finding: [k] and [g] differ only in
voicing, which is not changed in palatalization and is
articulatorily independent from the rest of the features of [k]
and [g]; thus, the perseveration hypothesis predicts no
learnability difference between [k][tʃ] and [g][dʒ].
Formally, the proposed bias is equivalent to a ranking of
output-output faithfulness constraints (Kenstowicz, 1996) in
Optimality Theory or unequal weighting in Harmonic
Grammar (Smolensky & Legendre, 2006). Namely, we will
show that changing [k] or [t] into [tʃ] is easier than changing
[p]. In Optimality Theory / Harmonic Grammar, this could
be described with a ranking: ("Keep [k]", "Keep [t]") <<
"Keep [p]". One way to model what subjects are learning in
the experiment is an increased weight on a constraint saying
that to-be-produced plural forms should end in [tʃi]. As the
weight of this constraint rises, it overtakes "Keep [k]" and

The differences in perseverance may be universal, rooted in
early articulatory experience, or language-specific. Further,
universal differences may be reduced or augmented by linguistic
experience. We do not seek to determine the source of the
observed bias in the present paper. Our aim is simply to
demonstrate that biases of the proposed form exist.

"Keep [t]" before overtaking "Keep [p]". As a result,
palatalization overgeneralizes from [p] to [t] and [k].
Faithfulness constraints are not a new idea in linguistics.
What is new here is the claim that the faithfulness
constraints in question are production-internal perseveratory
tendencies specific to articulatory units. One appealing
consequence of this proposal is that it provides a unified
explanation for the bias to add rather than delete noted in
both work on speech errors (Goldstein et al., 2007;
Hartsuiker, 2002; Stemberger, 1990) and work on loanword
adaptation in phonology (Kang, 2011; Paradis & LaCharité,
1997). In both cases, articulatory units are clamoring for
retention but nothing clamors for deletion, unless there are
strong prosodic constraints limiting word or syllable shape
(the only case when exceptions to the addition bias are
found in loanword adaptation, according to Kang, 2011).
The proposal that faithfulness constraints are rooted in
perseveration explains this typological generalization.
Making the relatively uncontroversial assumption of the
existence of morphological units in speech production (e.g.,
Dell, 1986; Roelofs, 1997), the proposed perseveration can
also straightforwardly capture the tendency for insertions to
happen at morpheme or stem boundaries rather than
morpheme- or stem-internally (Kenstowicz, 1994):
perseverating on a morphological/lexical unit prevents
changes inside that unit.
We propose that the bias against (certain) stem changes is
internal to the production system. We therefore expect that
it will manifest itself more strongly in production than in
acceptability rating. This prediction is consistent with
previous findings that a form with a stem change can be
judged as being more acceptable than a form without a stem
change and yet be less likely to be produced (Kapatsinski,
2012; Zuraw, 2000). Perseveration/self-priming is also
commonly observed in elicited production tests of rule
productivity, where participants have been observed to
repeatedly reuse a phoneme sequence in novel words
elicited on adjacent trials, even when the result violates
normal paradigmatic mappings or affix order preferences
(Bickel et al., 2007; Lobben, 1991).
Finally, the idea that output-output faithfulness is rooted
in motor perseveration is consistent with data from language
acquisition and motor development and provides an
independent justification for the initial high ranking of such
constraints proposed to be necessary to make OptimalityTheoretic grammars learnable (Hayes, 2004; McCarthy,
1998). Children are known to exhibit more motor
perseveration than adults (e.g., Smith et al., 1999; including
perseveration on phonetic segments: Stemberger, 1989;
Vousden & Maylor, 2006). It is therefore unsurprising that
they would perseverate more on a known form while
deriving an unknown morphologically-related form (e.g.,
Do, 2013), the pattern predicted by a high initial ranking of
OO-Faithfulness (“keep the X from the base form”)
constraints. In fact, perseveration on inflectional morphemes
recently produced (by children or their interlocutors), a
perseveratory tendency present but greatly diminished in

3455

adults, has been noted in the language acquisition literature
where perseveration on interlocutors' wordforms has been
argued to be functional in that the repeated morpheme is
usually correct in the context of the child's own utterance
(Ambridge & Lieven 2011:164-65). Again, it is only when
it is incorrect that we notice the perseveration; most of the
time perseveration is correct and perseverating on the
known form is a good strategy.

Methods

Predictions
The present experiments focus on a particular phonological
alternation, called palatalization, where a word-final [p], [k]
or [t] alternates with [tʃ] when followed by [a] but is left
unchanged before [i]. This is a pattern that runs counter to
phonetic naturalness (Guion, 1998; Kochetov, 2011;
Mitrovic, 2012; Wilson, 2006) but is attested in some
languages, e.g., before Russian diminutives, where –ok
palatalizes preceding [k] more than –ik does (Kapatsinski,
2010). Velar palatalization (ktʃ) and alveolar
palatalization (ttʃ) are much more common than labial
palatalization (ptʃ) (Kochetov, 2011) and involve an
articulatorily more minor change, since [t], [k] and [tʃ] are
all lingual gestures, while [p] is a labial one. Velar and
alveolar palatalization are attested approximately equally
often in languages of the world (Kochetov, 2011) and [tʃ]
shares articulatory characteristics with both [t] and [k],
involving both tongue tip (like [t]) and tongue body (like
[k]) gestures (Yun, 2006). The present experiment thus
seeks to determine whether there is a bias against the less
natural alternation (ptʃ) even in a context where no
palatalizing alternation is particularly natural (before [a]).
An important, and counterintuitive, prediction of the
theory is that the bias against changing a unit should be
context-independent, to the extent that the unit in question is
independent of the context in question in motor planning
and execution. The articulatory unit addressed by the
present experiments is the oral consonantal gesture. Work
on speech errors suggests that consonants, and especially
onsets, can move around in the motor plan independently
from vowels (e.g., Fowler, 2010; Meyer, 1992, p. 185-86;
Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1983).3
Our previous work (Kapatsinski 2012b) has demonstrated
that labial palatalization is more difficult to acquire than
velar or alveolar palatalization in the context of a following
[i], i.e., in a context where velar or alveolar palatalization
are phonetically motivated. However, this result is
consistent with a bias in favor of natural rules, i.e., changes
in context. However, if [p] is harder to change into [tʃ] than
[k] or [t] are independently of context, this should be true
even if the vowel triggering palatalization is [a]. This
prediction is tested in the experiment reported here.

There is some argument regarding whether the ‘segmental’
errors typically involve segments (Roelofs 1999, Stemberger 1982)
or gestures (Goldstein et al. 2007, Mowrey & MacKay 1990). The
distinction is unimportant for the present purposes: the vocalic
context is outside of both the segment and the gesture.

The grammars presented to learners are shown in Table 1.
There were three groups of participants. The Velar Group
was presented with a language in which [k] became [tʃ]
before [a] while [p] and [t] remained unchanged, e.g., [bikbitʃa, bit-bita, bip-bipa]. The Labial Group was presented
with a language in which [p] became [tʃ] before [a] while
[k] and [t] remained unchanged. The Alveolar Group was
presented with a language in which [t] became [tʃ] [a] while
[k] and [p] remained unchanged. In all languages, [i] and [a]
were plural suffixes. In all languages, the palatalizing
consonant was twice as common as any one of the nonpalatalizing ones.
Table 1: Grammars presented to learners. A separate
group of subjects was assigned to learn each of the
languages below.
Velar Group:
ikitʃa
ak{aki;atʃa}
tta
ppa

Alveolar Group:
ititʃa
at{ati;atʃa}
kka
ppa

Labial Group:
ipitʃa
ap{api;atʃa}
kka
tta

Languages were created from each other by swapping final
consonants in the singulars, meaning the contexts
surrounding the palatalized consonants were exactly parallel
across the three groups within each experiment. The stimuli
were then recorded by the first author and presented to
participants, all adult native English speakers recruited from
the Psychology/Linguistics human subjects pool, auditorily
through headphones. There were 25 participants in the
Alveolar Group, 29 in the Labial Group and 30 in the Velar
Group. All words were paired with pictures of referents
presented on the screen and presented in totally random
order. Participants were asked to learn the names of the
referents. A third of the way through training, they were
tested on word learning by being asked to produce all
wordforms they were presented with in the training when
cued with pictures of the referents. At the end of training,
the participants encountered an elicited production test,
where they were presented with novel singular forms (which
they had not encountered during training) and were asked to
say the right plural form. The production test was followed
by a rating test, in which the participants were presented
with novel singular-plural pairs and were asked to press a
button indicating whether the presented plural form was the
right one for the presented singular. Statistical significance
was evaluated using the original binary responses by means
of logistic mixed effects models in the lme4 package in R
(Bates et al., 2012) with random intercepts for subjects and
items and random slopes for between-subject variables
within Item and between-item variables within Subject
(following Barr et al., in press). All analyses reported here
were done on trials where –a was the suffix vowel chosen or
presented.

Figure 1: Results of the elicited production test. Vertical axes show whether or not the consonant was palatalized (Y,
shown in light, is “palatalized”, N, shown in dark, is “not palatalized”). Participants exposed to labial palatalization before [a]
palatalize [t] and [k] almost as much as they palatalize [p] (though the difference is significant: z=3.02,p=.002 for [p] vs. [k]
rates and z=2.85, p=.004 for [p] vs. [t]). Participants exposed to alveolar palatalization palatalize [t] much more than other
stops (z=5.87, p<.00001 for [t] vs. [k]; z=10.57, p<.00001 for [t] vs. [p]). [p] is palatalized less than [k] (z=3.35, p=.0008).
Participants exposed to velar palatalization palatalize [k] more than [p] (z=10.00,p<.00001) and more than [t] (z=5.16,
p<.00001); [t] is palatalized more than [p] (z=8.55,p<.00001).

Figure 2: Results of acceptability judgments in Experiment 2. Dark parts of bars show the proportion of ‘this is the wrong
plural form for this singular’ responses. Light parts of bars show the proportion of ‘this is the right plural form for this
singular’ responses. Following training on labial palatalization, subjects accept palatalized labials (ptʃa), alveolars (ttʃa)
and velars (ktʃa) at roughly equal rates whereas following training on alveolar or velar palatalization, the trained
alternation is accepted more often than untrained ones. However, after all kinds of training subjects learn to reject
unchanged/non-palatalized stops before the palatalizing vowel [a], and they do it at equal rates.

3457

Results
As shown in Figure 1, participants exposed to labial
palatalization do not learn the pattern as well as participants
exposed to velar or alveolar palatalization do, often learning
to palatalize everything or to palatalize nothing. The
differences in palatalization rates between the to-bepalatalized consonant and the not-to-be-palatalized
consonants is significantly smaller in the group trained on
ptʃ than in the group trained on ktʃ (z=8.98, p<.00001)
or ttʃ (z=3.34, p=.0008); the latter two groups do not
significantly differ (z=0.09, p=.93).
Figure 2 suggests that the same pattern holds for
acceptability judgment data: subjects trained on ptʃa
judge ptʃa examples ungrammatical almost as often as
examples of ttʃa and ktʃa (for this group, there is no
significant effect of singular-final consonant on
acceptability of palatalization, z=0.76, p=.45). By contrast,
subjects trained on ttʃa or ktʃa judge the alternations
they were trained on as being grammatical more often than
alternations they were not trained on (z=2.84, p=.004).
In addition, Figure 2 shows that the bias against labial
palatalization (i.e., changing [p] into [tʃa] rather than [pa]) is
not due to a bias in favor of [pa]: subjects learn that [a]
should not be preceded by [p] as easily as they learn that it
should not be preceded by [k] ot [t]: while ptʃ is worse
than ktʃ and ttʃ, [pa] is as bad as [ka] and [ta] (z=.83,
p=.39). Thus the observed bias against ptʃ is not a bias in
favor of [pa] or against [ka] and [ta].4
Finally, stem changes are accepted in acceptability
judgment much more than they are produced: the dark bars
in Figure 2 are lower than in the top panels of Figure 1
(z=3.07, p=.002), indicating that palatalization is usually
rated as acceptable, and in fact more acceptable than nonpalatalization, yet is rarely produced. Furthermore, the bias
against labial palatalization appears to be stronger in
production than in judging acceptability: to-be-palatalized
and not-to-be-palatalized consonants differ in acceptability
of palatalization across subject groups numerically but not
significantly (z=1.11, p=.27), but, as described above, these
between-group differences are significant in production. The
three-way interaction between test modality, whether or not
a consonant is to be palatalized, and subject group is also
significant (z=2.37, p=.018). These data provide direct

4

Some may wonder whether participants actually learn to
palatalize before [a] rather than learning to palatalize before [i] or
after [i]. There was no effect of stem vowel on acceptability
(z=1.01, p=.31) of palatalization, whereas in production stem [i]
disfavored palatalization (z=3.55, p=.0003) rather than favoring it.
The effect of final vowel on palatalization production probability
(z=4.99, p<.00001) and acceptability (z=2.14, p=.03) was in the
direction predicted by training, rather than phonetic naturalness,
i.e., palatalization occurred/was rated more acceptable than nonpalatalization before [a] more often than before [i]. Thus, the
vowel triggering palatalization in the grammars learned by our
subjects does appear to be a following [a], making the context for
palatalization phonetically unnatural.

evidence for a production basis for faithfulness and the
observed bias against ptʃ.

Discussion and Conclusion
In this experiment, we have demonstrated that there is a bias
against labial palatalization in a context where all kinds of
palatalization are phonetically unmotivated. Thus we
suggest that the bias is not in favor of phoneticallymotivated rules, or changes in context. We have also shown
that the bias is not due to differentially ranked phonotactic
constraints on the output forms: the result of alternation is
always the same [tʃa], regardless of the consonant that is
changed, and learners acquire a dispreference against [pa],
[ta], and [ka], the outputs competing with [tʃa] equally well.
We are therefore left with two options, both of which can be
modeled using Faithfulness constraints in Harmonic
Grammar (Smolensky & Legendre, 2006): the learners
might be biased against mapping [p] onto [tʃ] (Steriade,
2001), or against deleting the labial closure gesture
associated with [p] (Kapatsinski, 2013; Kenstowicz 1996).
Theories of Faithfulness / avoidance of stem changes
differ on whether Faithfulness is grounded in perception
(avoiding changes that the listener would easily perceive
and would face difficulty undoing to recover the base form
of the stem, Steriade, 2001), articulation (perseverating on
gestures of the known form while deriving an unknown
form, Kapatsinski, 2013), or an offline preference for
uniform morphological paradigms (e.g., storage economy or
one-to-one form-meaning mappings, Kenstowicz’s [1996]
uniform exponence; McCarthy’s [2005] optimal paradigms).
The present data support the gestural account, as it alone
seems to account for the differences between production and
acceptability judgment. Namely, the biases against stem
changes are stronger in production (see also Kapatsinski,
2012; Zuraw, 2000). The gestural account is also the only
one that can account for the data described in the
introduction, and it alone seems to be an inevitable
component of the production process when a novel form is
derived from a known one.
The bias we observe may or may not be specific to
English speakers. While labials are unlikely to change
across languages (e.g., Kochetov, 2011), English does have
palatalization of alveolars, as in create/creature or, variably,
in would/would you. The fact that we also observe a
preference for velar palatalization over labial palatalization
suggests that the preference against labial palatalization is
not solely a first-language effect. Nonetheless, first language
experience undoubtedly changes the weights of faithfulness
constraints, hence cross-linguistic and developmental work
on this issue would be most informative. Of particular
interest here are languages that have labial palatalization,
e.g., Southern Bantu (Ohala, 1978).
All we wish to claim at this point is that there are
faithfulness constraints militating against stem changes,
regardless of context, that they are production-based, and
that they vary in weight, making some of these constraints
stronger than others at the beginning of our experiment.
