                       Experiment 2
It is a natural feature of Bayesian models that the influence
of priors diminishes as learners gather more data. Thus, the
SS power model (Lu et al., 2008) predicts that competition
between causes should be strongest when participants have
made few observations, and will diminish as participants are
exposed to more data.
   Experiment 2 examined competition between causes after
varying amounts of experience. The design was identical to
that of Experiment 1, but added a second independent
variable: sample size. Participants in both strong- and weak-
B conditions were asked to make judgments of causal
strength three times, after viewing 44, 88 and finally 132
total cases. This resulted in a 2 x 3 factorial design, with one
between-subjects factor (causal strength of cue B) and one
within-subjects factor (number of cases observed).
   The cover story was the same as it in Experiment 1,
except for one sentence: “The resort's doctor thinks one or
perhaps several of these exotic vegetables may be causing
the illness” (Experiment 1) was revised to read, “The
resort's doctor thinks these exotic vegetables may be causing
the illness.”
