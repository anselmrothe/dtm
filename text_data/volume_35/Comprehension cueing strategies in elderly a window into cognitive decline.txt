Comprehension cueing strategies in elderly: a window into cognitive decline?

Abstract
Language abilities gradually decline as we age, but the
mechanisms of this decline are not well understood. The
present study investigated comprehension of subject vs.
object who and which direct questions (DQs), embedded
questions (EQs) and relative clauses (RCs) in 39 cognitively
healthy native speakers of Spanish. The elderly participants (n
= 21) were further classified according to their scores on a
general cognitive test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA), into a group with low MoCA scores, LM (n = 10),
and a group with normal MoCA scores, NM (n = 11). A
mixed-model, repeated-measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) showed that the elderly participants achieved
significantly worse accuracy and speed than the young
participants (Y) in all tasks. Accuracy was significantly lower
and reaction times significantly longer in the LM group
compared to the NM group in DQs and RCs. Accuracy in
comprehension of EQs was also worse in LM compared to
NM, with no significant difference in RTs between the two
groups. The results are explained within the competition
model and reliance on a language-specific cueing strategy.
Reliance on cueing strategies in sentence comprehension may
be an effective indicator of cognitive decline associated with
aging.

Introduction
Cognitive aging is typically associated with a decline in
speed of processing and deterioration of memory and
attention (Salthouse, 2009). Language abilities also
gradually decline as we age, which is reflected in decreased
vocabulary, smaller mean number of clauses per utterance,
simplified syntactic structure of produced sentences,
reliance on optimization strategies when choosing referring
expressions as well as difficulty in comprehension of
complex sentences (Kemper, Thompson & Marquis, 2001;
Grossman, Cooke, De Vita, Chen, Moore et al., 2002;
Hendriks, Englert, Wubs & Hoeks, 2008). Older adults’
language comprehension decline appears to be due not to
sensory, but cognitive demands of spoken language, with
complex syntax slowing down the comprehension even
when sentence understanding is accurate (Tun, Benichov &
Wingfield, 2010). Research on English has shown that
comprehension of structures that require a syntactic
operation of movement and involve a longer gap between a
moved element and its trace (t), such as object relative
clauses (e.g., The cat i that the dog chased ti is black), is
impaired in elderly adults, while comprehension of subject
relative clauses, in which this gap is smaller (e.g., The cati
that ti chased the dog is black), is spared (e.g., Zurif,
Swinney, Prather, Wingfield & Brownell, 1995; StineMorrow, Ryan & Leonard, 2000). One explanation of this
finding is that the object relative clauses require allocation
of more working memory (WM) resources than subject

relative clauses, and WM limitation is one of key features of
cognitive aging (Zurif et al., 1995; Caplan & Waters, 1999;
Stine-Morrow et al., 2000; Grossman, Cooke, De Vita,
Alsop, Detre et al., 2002).
Furthermore, neuroimaging research has shown that when
processing complex sentences, healthy seniors compared to
young participants show reduced activation in the core
language areas (e.g., inferior frontal regions), while showing
additional activation of some areas that are not considered
the “core” sentence processing network as well as difference
in the coherence of connectivity of the involved brain areas
(Peelle, Troiani, Wingfield, & Grossman, 2010; Tyler,
Shafto, Randall, Wright, Marslen-Wilson et al., 2010).
Activation of the brain regions that are not typically
involved in language processing has been interpreted as an
indicator of compensatory processes (Grossman et al., 2002;
Wingfield & Grossman, 2006; Tyler et al., 2010).
Better understanding of the earliest changes in typical
cognitive aging is also an important step towards better
understanding of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continuum.
Structural and metabolic changes in AD brain occur long
before cognitive symptoms become apparent (Dubois et al.,
2007, 2010; Sperling et al., 2011). Crucially, even small
metabolic and structural alterations in the brain may affect
the dynamics enabling cognitive function (Buckner, Snyder,
Shannon, LaRossa, Sachs, et al., 2005). Thus, it is important
to understand the brain’s ability to engage alternate
networks and rely on cognitive strategies compensating for
a deteriorating cognitive function.
One goal of the present study was to determine whether
elderly native speakers of Spanish rely on compensatory
strategies in sentence comprehension. We chose to study
comprehension of wh-structures (i.e., structures formed by
wh-words, such as what, who, which, etc.): direct and
embedded questions introduced by interrogative pronouns
qué (“what, which”) and quién (“who”) and relative clauses
introduced by que. Like in English, the distance between a
moved element and its gap is longer in object than in subject
wh-structures, as shown in (1-2):
(1) ¿Quiéni ti comió una naranja?
(2) ¿A quiéni mordiój el perrito tj ti ?
However, in Spanish preposition a marks object whquestions and therefore it could serve as a processing cue.
Since it appears before the moved wh-word, it signals an
object structure, allowing the parser to assign a temporary
thematic role before encountering the gap. Thus, reliance on
this cue would facilitate comprehension of object structures,
resulting in their good comprehension, even though they are
syntactically more difficult than subject structures and
require more WM resources.

2. Present Study
2.1 Participants
We tested 39 neurologically healthy native speakers of
Spanish, of which 21 were older and 18 were young
persons. There was a statistically significant difference in
age between the groups (t (27) = 28.457, p < 0.05) and years
of education (t (30) = 6.76, p < 0.05), but not in gender
distribution (χ2(1) = 1.857, p = 0.17).
The group of elderly was divided into two subgroups,
based on their MoCA scores: since the scores lower than 26
indicate mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Chertkow,
Massoud, Nasreddine, Belleville, Joanette, et al., 2008), we
used a cut-off score of 26 to dichotomize the elderly
participants into a Normal MoCA scores group (NM) (≥ 26)
and a Low MoCA group (LM) (< 26). Comparing the age
means of the latter two groups revealed that the LM group
(73.8 ±6.25) was significantly older than the NM group
(66.45 ±5.14): t (19) = 2.95, p = 0.008). The two groups did
not differ significantly in years of education (t (19) = 6.14, p
= 0.54) or in gender distribution (χ2(1) = 0.064, p = 0.8).
All participants were healthy, with no history of stroke,
neurological disorders, alcohol/drug abuse, or other
conditions that could affect cognition. They all reported
normal hearing, and normal/ corrected to normal vision. All
participants were recruited through the Ingema Foundation.
Participants’ characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

2.2 Evaluative measures
In addition to a test of global cognition (MoCA), we
administered the Month Ordering Test to assess verbal WM
(VWM). This test assesses storage and manipulation of
material with semantic content, i.e., names of the months in
calendar, which makes it highly relevant for studies of
sentence comprehension (Almor et al., 2001; Goral, ClarkCotton, Spiro, Obler, Verkuilen et al., 2011). The months
are given in a non-canonical order and participants’ task is
to repeat them canonically. There are 20 strings of months
in total, distributed across 5 levels, with 4 strings at each
level, containing a different number of months to order.
Each correctly ordered string is scored as one point. Thus,
the total possible score is 20. Participants’ scores on
evaluative measures are summarized together with their
demographic characteristics in Table 1.

There were three experiments in the study. Experiment 1
tested comprehension of who and which NP direct questions
(DQs) extracted from a subject vs. object position in a
sentence. It contained 40 sentences: 20 who DQ (ten subject
and ten object questions) and 20 which NP DQs (ten subject
and ten objects questions). Each question was preceded by a
declarative sentence describing a situation from everyday
life, such as: Pablo is eating apples and Juan is eating
oranges. Thus, for a subject position, a who question would
be: Who is eating oranges? And a which-NP question would
be: Which boy is eating oranges? The sentences were
presented auditorily, and possible answers—Pablo, Juan—
appeared in a written form, on the left and right side of the
computer screen, respectively. The participants indicated
their responses by pressing the left or right arrow on the
keyboard, depending on whether the correct answer was on
the left or on the right side of the screen.
Experiment 2 tested comprehension of embedded
questions (EQs). There were 80 EQs: 40 who and 40 which
NP questions, with 20 subject and 20 object questions
within each group. Half of the questions (n=40) contained
one prepositional phrase (PP) and the other half contained
two PPs. EQs were tested in a verification paradigm:
participants were required to listen to a sentence, followed
by a verification statement, and decide whether the
statement was correct or incorrect relative to the sentence.
The participants indicated their answers by pressing the left
vs. right arrow on the keyboard, depending on whether
“Correct” and “Incorrect” appeared on the left or right side
of the computer screen.
In Experiment 3, we tested comprehension of relative
clauses (RCs). There were 10 subject and 10 object RCs
introduced by que. The tested structure was preceded by a
simple sentence providing a context. As in Experiments 1
and 2, participants were required to indicate their answers
by pressing the left or right keyboard arrow.
Sentence stimuli for each experiment were first
randomized in Excel and then recorded in Audacity
(http://audacity.sourceforge.net/). Prerecorded sentences
were
imported
in
the
DMDX
(www.
http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kforster/dmdx) and presented
auditorily over a PC computer and a set of speakerphones.

2.4 Procedures
Participants were instructed to respond to a question as
fast and as accurately as possible. The next sentence was
initiated by the subject’s response. The left and right arrow
responses for correct answers were counter-balanced across
conditions in each experiment. There was a time window of
5,000 msec for answers. If the participant did not respond
within that time, the answer options disappeared from the
screen, and a fixation cross appeared, indicating that a new
auditory stimuli was about to appear. A failure to respond
within 5,000 msec was scored as an error. There was a 30second break after every 20 sentences. Feedback showing
whether the answers were correct or incorrect was given on

2.3 Experimental measures

2747

the computer screen only during the practice trials. There
was no feedback during the actual testing.
Each session began with the experimenter describing the
study, and the participant reading and signing the informed
consent. After that, demographic details were collected and
precise instructions on how to execute the experimental
tasks were given. This was followed by the participant’s
taking 8 practice trials. After a satisfactory performance on
the practice trials, the participants were tested on the
experimental measures. Finally, MoCA and the Month
Ordering Test to assess verbal WM (the VWM test
henceforth) were administered.
All the materials were administered in the same order to
each participant, except for the experimental stimuli, which
were administered as two different randomizations, which
were introduced to allow controlling for the effects of
stimulus ordering. Testing was carried out in a quiet room at
Ingema laboratory facilities in San Sebastián. It was
conducted individually with each participant and completed
in a single session, which lasted approximately 1 hour and
10 minutes. The study was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local
Ethics’ Committee.

3. Results
3.1 Evaluative Measures
There were statistically significant differences between the
elderly group overall and the young participants on MoCA
(t (25) = 4.431, p < 0.0005) and VWM test (t (36.5) = 2.714,
p = 0.01), indicating better performance of the younger
compared to the older participants. Within the group of
elderly participants, the NM group outperformed the LM
group on both tests – MoCA: t (19) = 5.42, p = 0.001, and
VWM: t (19) = 3.792, p = 0.001. There was a significant
positive correlation between years of education and MoCA
(r = 0.597, N = 39, p < 0.01), and between MoCA and
VWM scores (r = 0.611, N = 39, p < 0.01). There was a
significant negative correlation between age and MoCA
scores (r = -0.607, N = 39, p < 0.01), and between age and
VWM scores (r = -0.495, N = 39, p < 0.001). All tests were
two-tailed.

3.2 Experimental Measures
Accuracy and RTs of understanding wh-dependencies were
analyzed in a mixed-model, repeated-measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA), with a between-subject factor
comparing groups (LM, NM, Y) and within-subject factors
comparing the extraction site in a sentence (subject/object)
and the type of wh-word (who/which).
Experiment 1: Direct Questions. The accuracy analyses
showed that the main effect of group was significant, i.e.,
there were statistically significant differences in the
participants' overall sentence comprehension between the
groups (F(2,36) = 30.421, p = 0.001). The results of a posthoc Tukey test showed significant differences in

comprehension between the Y group and the LM group (p <
0.005), and between the NM group and the LM group (p <
0.005). In both comparisons, the LM group had lower
accuracy. The difference between the Y and the NM groups
was not significant (p = 0.81). The main effect of extraction
site (subject/object) was significant (F(1,36) = 4.564, p <
0.04), reflecting better comprehension of object structures,
whereas the main effect of wh-word was not significant
(F(1, 36) = 0.187, p = 0.668).
The analysis of RTs also showed that the main effects of
the group (F(2,36) = 37.844, p < 0.001) and extraction site
were significant (F(1,36) = 4.479, p = 0.041), and so was
the effect of the two-way interaction between the extraction
site and group (F(2,36) = 3.593, p = 0.038). Tukey test
showed significant differences between the Y group and the
NM group (p < 0.005), between the Y and LM groups (p <
0.005), and between the NM and the LM groups (p <
0.001), with the LM group reacting slower in both cases.
Experiment 2: Embedded Questions. Comprehension of
EQs did not show a significant effect of extraction site
(subject/object) (F(1,36) = 3.517, p = 0.69). However, the
main effect of wh-word (who/which) was significant
(F(1,36) = 5.623, p = 0.023), and so was the interaction
between the extraction site and type of wh-word (F(1,36) =
5.001, p = 0.032). The type of wh-word also interacted with
PP (F(1,36) = 5.454, p = 0.025). There were significant
differences in the participants' overall sentence
comprehension (F(2,36) = 61.990, p < 0.001). The results of
Tukey test showed significant differences for every pair of
groups (LM vs. Y: p < 0.005; LM vs. NM: p < 0.005; NM
vs. Y: p < 0.001), where the Y group was the most accurate,
while the LM group was the least accurate. Since the lowest
scores were achieved on tasks in Experiment 2, percent
correct responses across all conditions are given in Table 2
as another view into the data.
Table 2: Percent correct responses on Experiment 2.

Since questions in all experiments required a choice
between two possibilities, 50% correct represented chance
performance on all tasks, and scores between 26-75% were
considered to be within the range of chance. A score of 75%
or better was considered better than chance performance,
while a score of 25% or below was taken to indicate a
systematic reversal in the interpretation of a particular
construction (there were no such scores in our data).
The analysis of the RT data has shown that the main
effects of wh-word and extraction site were not significant,
but the interaction between these two factors was significant
(F(1,36) = 11.263, p = 0.002). There was a significant effect
of PP (F(1,36) = 22.369, p < 0.001), and it interacted with

2748

the group (F(2,36) = 4.139, p = 0.024). A three-way
interaction between PP, group, and wh-word was also
significant (F(2,36) = 3.315, p = 0.048). RTs differed
significantly among the groups (F(2,36) = 14.049, p <
0.001), and the post-hoc Tukey test showed that the Y group
was faster than the LM group (p = 0.001) and the NM group
(p = 0.031). The difference in RTs between the latter two
groups was also significant (p = 0.05).
Thus, the results of Experiment 2 indicate that embedded
questions containing additional phrases such as PPs are in
general difficult to process for cognitively healthy older
adults, in particular to those with mildly affected general
cognition and VWM.
Experiment 3: Relative Clauses. There were no significant
within-subject effects in participants’ comprehension of
RCs. Neither the main effect of extraction site was
significant (F(1,36) = 1.651, p = 0.2) nor its interaction
with the group (F(1,36) = 0.744, p = 0.42). There were
significant differences in the participants' overall
comprehension of RC among the groups (F (2,36) = 9.662,
p < 0.001). The results of Tukey test showed that there were
significant differences in the comprehension between the Y
and the LM groups (p = 0.001), and between the NM group
and the LM group (p = 0.024). In both cases the LM group
had lower accuracy. RTs differed significantly among the
groups (F(2,36) = 26.784, p < 0.001), and the Tukey test
showed significant differences between every pair of
groups: the Y group was the fastest, while the LM group
was the slowest one.

3.3 Summary of results
Overall, lower accuracy and longer reaction times in
comprehension of DQs and RCs were found in LM
compared to NM participants. Comprehension of EQs was
also worse in the LM group compared to the NM group
(accuracy), but this was not associated with significant
differences in RTs between the two groups. The Y group
showed significantly better comprehension accuracy and
speed in all tasks. Adding one or two PPs to the whstructures in EQs pushed the comprehension of the LM
group to the chance level on all EQs, as well as
comprehension of the NM group of 3 out of 4 types of who
EQs. Note that adding the PPs only extended the length of
sentences, without adding new layers of structure. Thus,
extra processing load, even if imposed only linearly and not
hierarchically, leads to a difficulty in comprehension of whstructures in healthy elderly adults. This finding supports
the notion that excessive processing demands may turn the
cueing strategy ineffective.

4. Discussion
The fact that the LM group turned out to be significantly
older than the NM group may reflect dynamics of language
deterioration associated with aging. While the results of
evaluative measures showed that age affected both MoCA
and VWM scores (the higher the age, the worse the results),

education also affected the scores, with the more years of
education being associated with the better scores. However,
lack of a statistically significant difference in years of
education between the LM and NM groups indicates that the
differences in results of cognitive tests between these two
groups cannot be explained in terms of a general difference
in years of education. Our results generally agree with
previous findings on more accuracy errors and longer RTs
in syntactic processing in elderly native speakers of English
(Obler et al., 1991).

4.1 Subject vs. object
An interesting finding of the present study is better
comprehension of object than subject who DQs. Given that
the distance between the moved wh-word and its trace is
longer in object questions (2) than in subject questions (1),
we would expect object structures to be more demanding for
processing. According to distance-based accounts, the
shorter distance between the trace and its gap poses less
burden on WM in subject- than in object-wh-questions,
which explains the data from English discussed in the
Introduction. However, our finding that object DQs were
better comprehended than subject DQs is not in line with
such accounts.
The idea that processing in structurally different languages
reflects the structural differences among languages and that
in different languages different types of information may
serve as cues in sentence processing is the backbone of the
competition model (Bates & MacWhinney, 1987;
MacWhinney, 1987). According to this model, the language
processor chooses which information to attend to in
determining sentence meaning based on specific
characteristics of cues. For instance, the preposition a in
Spanish is not a highly available cue, because it appears
only with animate direct objects. It is not a highly reliable
cue, because it can convey several different meanings.
However, it is not costly to process, and despite its weak
cue validity, it can guide sentence comprehension: the
preposition a has “an extremely high contrast validity…
Among normal speakers, in fact, it is the most overriding
cue in determining semantic role” (Benedet et al., 1998, p.
332).
Thus, the finding that object DQs were comprehended
better than subject DQs reflects a strategy based on syntactic
cueing: object DQs in our experiments are introduced by a
PP (a qué), beginning with the preposition a, which signals
the grammatical role of object and the thematic role of
Patient. Therefore, it is possible for the processor to rely on
a in correctly predicting the grammatical function and
temporarily assign a thematic role to the initial constituent
in a sentence such as (2) before encountering the gap. Once
it encounters the gap, the temporarily assigned thematic role
is confirmed or disconfirmed. Our data show that this
information was utilized by the LM group in the
comprehension of direct object who questions. This strategy
reduces the processing demands on WM and facilitates
comprehension when WM resources are reduced. However,

2749

if the processing demands are too high, as in examples of
EQs extended with additional PPs, the cueing strategy is
not effective.
Another indicator that comprehension of EQs in two
groups of elderly was at chance due to processing
limitations is related to the finding that their comprehension
of RCs was accurate. This finding shows that in older
Spanish speakers this cuing strategy can be effective in
syntactically more difficult conditions (e.g., object RCs and
DQs), but it may not be effective when processing load is
too high, regardless of syntactic complexity (extended EQs).
Since the strategy of reliance on the preposition a is
language-specific, it is not available to speakers of English,
and therefore the patterns of comprehension of object
structures differ in the elderly speakers of these two
languages.

4.2 Who vs. which
Wh-word-order in Spanish requires that a wh-word occupies
a sentence- or clause-initial position, prohibiting preverbal
subjects (Jaeggli, 1982; Goodall, 2004). Wh-words in
multiple wh-questions, however, can switch between subject
and object positions, as shown in (4-7):
(4) ¿Quién compro qué?
“Who bought what?”
(5) ¿Qué compro quién?
“What did who buy?”
(6) Juan sabe qué dijo quién.
“Juan knows what who said.”
(7) Juan sabe quién dijo qué.
“Juan knows who said what.” (Jaeggli, 1982, p.156).
Since quién and qué can switch their positions in a sentence,
it appears that they do not obey the Superiority requirements
(Chomsky, 1973; Pesetsky, 1987). This further means that
there are no syntactic differences between quién and qué,
and thus no syntactic reason to expect differences in their
processing.
There are, however, differences between quién and qué at
the discourse level: quién “who” is non-referential and nondiscourse-linked, while qué “which” is referential and
discourse-linked (D-linked). Some researchers argue that
this difference affects processing (Hickok & Avrutin, 1995):
D-linked expressions are easier to comprehend, because
they refer to a set of objects that is already known to the
hearer. By contrast, who/what refers to an unlimited set of
objects with which the hearer is not familiar, which makes
them more difficult to process. Other researchers, however,
pointed out that it is precisely their D-linked nature that
makes which expressions more difficult, because they
require processing and integration of information at two
levels – syntax and discourse (Avrutin, 2000). Our data
support the former view, showing the effect of wh-word in
EQs, i.e., better comprehension of which questions.
However, additional processing load of 1 or 2 PPs cancelled
out the cuing strategy based on structural sentential features,

which facilitated comprehension of direct object who
questions.
In conclusion, the main finding of the present study is a
decline in comprehension of wh-structures and reliance on
cueing as a compensatory mechanism in sentence
comprehension in older native-Spanish-speaking adults.
This strategy is effective in syntactically demanding
conditions, when WM demands are not too high. However,
excessive WM load prevents the use of the strategy. Thus,
our results agree with previous findings in suggesting that it
is not syntax per se, but limitation of WM resources which
are necessary for processing that is affected in aging.
Further research needs to address questions pertaining to
language-memory interface in older people with lower
scores on tests of global cognition, such as MoCA, whose
language, although appears to be normal, shows signs of
decline when tested more carefully. Studying the
compensatory mechanisms and strategies employed in
language processing in such individuals may help us to
understand better the transition from healthy aging to mild
cognitive impairment and the AD continuum.
