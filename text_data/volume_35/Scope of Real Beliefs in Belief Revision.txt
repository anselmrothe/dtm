Abstract
The present study examines the decisions made by reasoners
when they are asked to revise their beliefs in the face of new,
counterfactual information. Participants indicated the Scope (the
degree of set inclusion) of semantic generalizations about real
categories in a Pretest. In subsequent experiments, these Scope
values were used to predict the willingness of participants to retain
statements in their existing knowledge sets. When those sets were
logically compatible with a Modus Tollens (MT) structure,
participants were more likely to retain the general statements, but
not when the sets were logically compatible with a Modus Ponens
(MP) structure. However, the MP retention rates increased when
locatives were added to the generalizations. These findings are
inconsistent with several prevailing proposals of belief revision but
do support the concept of belief revision as following Possible
Worlds logic.
Keywords: belief revision; counterfactual reasoning; scope.

Introduction
The process of belief revision is known by many terms
(e.g., belief updating, belief change or belief dynamics).
Simply put, belief revision involves the possibility of
changing a previously held belief in light of new and
assumed true information. At its very basic level, this
involves updating knowledge and resolving inconsistencies
within a pre-existing knowledge structure.
True belief revision must involve commitment to true
beliefs. The earliest belief revision studies employed
dictionary definitions without proper verification that those
definitions had merit or that the students were committed to
those definitions (Revlis & Hayes, 1972). Later studies
examined belief revision with artificial categories or groups,
of which a participant might have had no previous
knowledge (e.g., Byrne & Walsh, 2002; Elio & Pelletier,
1997; Politzer & Carles, 2001; Revlin, Cate, & Rouss,
2001). Revlin, Calvillo, and Ballard (2005) specifically
created a fantasy world with Lego figures and various
arbitrary rules about knights and kings (see also Van Hoeck,
Revlin, Dieussaert, & Schaeken, 2012). In each of these
cases, real beliefs were not tested. It is difficult to assess the
process of belief updating when the epistemic system is
limited to arbitrary or unverified knowledge. The findings
from such studies have supported conflicting theoretical
treatments (e.g., Byrne & Walsh, 2002; Wolf, Rieger, &
Knauff, 2012; Revlin et al., 2001; Revlis & Hayes, 1972).
The focus of the present study is to identify the basic

cognitive processes in true belief revision while still
employing an established paradigm.
A basic paradigm for studying natural belief revision has
been borrowed from the philosophical treatment of beliefcontravening problems (Rescher, 1964): It consists of a set
of beliefs that are relevant to a counterfactual assumption,
whose introduction requires a revision of the belief set. For
example,
(1a) All whales are mammals
(1b) This creature is not a mammal
(1c) This creature is not a whale
(1d) Assume that this creature is a whale
A typical adult reasoner with the current knowledge of
statements (1a-1c) would appreciate the inherent
consistency of these statements. This collection of
statements follows the logical form of Modus Tollens (MT;
p  q, ~q, ∴ ~p). However, if someone is faced with
statement (1d), an inconsistency is introduced to the
knowledge structure and the revision process requires the
reestablishment of a consistent epistemic set that entails the
retention of (1d). To accomplish this, the reasoner notices
that statement (1d) is in direct contradiction to statement
(1c), which can be easily eliminated. However, there is a
larger issue. The remaining statements (1a & 1b) jointly
create a contradiction with (1d). To resolve this
inconsistency, a choice must now be made: Does the
individual accept statement (1a), retaining the previously
held belief that all whales are mammals, and that it cannot
be true that there is an creature that is classified as a whale
that is not a mammal? Or does the individual accept
statement (1b), and claim that it could be true that there are
creatures classified as whales that are not mammals? The
revision process requires the elimination of one of the two
statements. Either path is equally logical, although standard
logic fails to encourage a preference, only indicating to the
reasoner that there is an inconsistency (Chisholm, 1946).
While an individual can reject both statements, the goal is
generally to retain the maximum number of statements that
already exist within the epistemic set. A second logical form
typically used in belief-contravening problems is that of
Modus Ponens (MP; p  q, p, ∴ q), illustrated in (2)
below:
(2a) All whales are mammals
(2b) This creature is a whale
(2c) This creature is a mammal
(2d) Assume that this creature is not a mammal

1414

The assumption (2d) introduces the same direct and
indirect contradictions as (1) above, and the reasoners must
revise the belief-set to resolve the inconsistencies that are
created. Notice that the MP assumption (2d) undermines the
credibility of the generality (2a) by changing the properties
of the specific instance (2b) that is already within a
category—thereby making the category incoherent. In
contrast, the MT assumption (1d) adds a new member to a
category (1b) with seemingly different group membership or
properties, while not changing the credibility of the
generality as in the case of the MP assumption.
Despite the fact that standard logic is unable to guide the
selection made by reasoners, they have shown distinct
patterns of resolution for each of the logical forms, which
vary with the content of the studies. In some studies,
reasoners show a distinct preference to retain the
generalities in problems like (1) above (e.g., Revlin et al.,
2005; Revlin, Calvillo, & Mautone, 2003). In other studies,
preference has been shown for creating disabling conditions
(or exceptions to the generality or rule), which allows them
to be supported with caveats (Khemlani & Johnson-Laird,
2011). In some studies, no preference among reasoners has
been shown, especially for problems like (2) above (Byrne
& Walsh, 2002). We propose here that these differential
findings may be a consequence of the degree of reality of
the beliefs to be revised.
In addition to examining the role of real beliefs, the
present study will focus on the importance of Scope in
belief revision. The Scope of a quantified statement
specifies the instances of the generality (or rule) that are
subsumed within it across time and space. To demonstrate,
consider the statements: all the coins in my pocket on VE
Day are silver (Goodman, 1954) and all whales are
mammals (Ryle, 1949). While these statements are both
universally quantified generalities, the first is considered an
accidental generality (it just so happens that all the coins in
the pocket are silver), and the second is a scientific law
(which spans space and time). A reasoner would prefer to
retain the second statement because of its law-like quality;
such statements are intended to act as inference tickets in
new situations (Ryle, 1949). A reasoner should regard the
Scope of the first statement about the silver coins to be quite
small. In contrast, a reasoner should recognize that the
second generality regarding mammalian whales has a large
Scope (imagine all the whales that have existed in the past,
present, and future and classify them into the superordinate
category of mammals). The Scope of these relationships is
generally an important proxy for knowledge preservation
and credibility. It is possible that belief revision with
artificial categories employed generalities with restricted
Scope, which impacted revisions.
In the experiments in this study, Scope is either presented
implicitly (with statements from the Pretest) or explicitly
(the inclusion of numbers in the generality expression), and
the goal is to determine whether Scope affects belief
revision. To gain a sense of a statement’s Scope at a
granular level, we asked participants to indicate the number

of instances of a large category that possess a critical
property—e.g., the number of whales that are mammals.
A pretest was used to assess participants’ commitment to
Scope values of general statements that were derived from
theories of semantic knowledge (e.g., Collins & Quillian,
1969; Quillian, 1968; Rips, 1989). In Experiment 1, these
generalities were included in a basic belief revision
paradigm where problems took the logical forms seen in
example problems (1) and (2). In Experiment 2, locatives
were added to the statements to constrain the law-like
quality of the statements and to de-couple real world
categories from the reasoning context. In Experiment 3, the
Scope of the statements was explicitly manipulated into
small and large proportions of a given set (Scope) to
determine the effects of explicitly stated Scope on the
reasoning process.

Pretest
In order to create test materials for the belief revision task
(Experiments 1-3), a pretest was developed to measure the
implicit Scope values of various general statements.
Ninety-one undergraduates volunteered to participate in
this pretest condition for course credit. They viewed 24
universally quantified statements. There were four
conditions of statements created by crossing two levels of
Ontology (Definitionally true or Empirically true
statements) by two levels of Relation (Class-Inclusion or
Property-Assignment).
Students identified the Scope of each statement on an 8point scale, where each point corresponded to a power of
10. The scale was anchored by “0” and “7”. For example, a
Scope of “4” encompassed a Scope size from 1,000 to
10,000. The order of the statements was randomized in the
booklet.
As anticipated, Scope values were greater for Definitional
statements (M = 6.26, SD = .90, e.g., All trees are plants)
than Empirical statements (M = 5.65, SD = .82, e.g., All
professors are teachers). Class Inclusion statements (M =
6.09, SD = .88, e.g., All oranges are fruit) received greater
Scope values than Property-Assignment statements (M =
5.82, SD = .83, e.g., All mammals have hair). These findings
are in keeping with the importance of these variables for
semantic verification (e.g., Collins & Quillian, 1969;
Quillian, 1968; Rips, 1989)

Experiment 1
The goal for Experiment 1 was to examine belief revision in
the context of statements that have verified believability and
Scope. Using the Scope values recorded from the Pretest,
we aimed to compare those values with retention rates to
determine the role of Scope in a statement’s retention. We
predicted that for both MT and MP problems, retention rates
would increase as the Scope of the generality increased
because Scope reflects the law-like aspect of the statements.

Seventy-seven undergraduate students participated in this
experiment for course credit. Two booklets of belief
revision problems were created from the Pretest materials.
One booklet contained MT belief revision problems and the
second contained MP belief revision problems. Within each
booklet, there were four types of problems (Problem Type)
that result from the crossing of Ontology (Definitional or
Empirical relations and Relation (Class-Inclusion or
Property-Assignment). There were three exemplars for each
type of problem, chosen randomly from the Pretest, creating
booklets of 12 problems each.
The problems were randomly ordered in each booklet and
the booklets were randomly assigned to participants. For
each problem, participants were asked to accept the
assumption as true, and discard (by crossing-out) the
statements that contradicted the assumption.

Results and Discussion
Participants’ preference to retain the generality was scored
for each problem and compared with chance (50%).

structure was expressed as an MT argument than as an MP
argument even though the generalities are identical in the
two conditions.
The Scope of the generality correlates positively and
strongly with the tendency of reasoners to retain them in a
MT argument structure, but Scope was negatively related to
retention of generalities in MP arguments.

Experiment 2
In this experiment, we once again assess the importance of
Scope for belief revision. Here we try to constrain the Scope
of the generalities by including a location in each epistemic
set that implicitly constrains the generalities’ Scope in space
and time. When a locative is introduced, does it undermine
the impression that the generalities are true across space and
time? For example, consider “All snakes slither.” This
statement entails a large Scope (shown in Experiment 1).
However, if a special desert is referred to (e.g., Rich lives in
a desert where all the snakes slither), it invites the question
whether there could be something peculiar about the
location or why would it be introduced? Here we assess
whether a specific location limits the Scope of the
generalization and therefore the pattern of belief revision.
Alternatively, perhaps the cognitive processes employed to
uncouple the generalization from the location would result
in enhancing the reasoner’s commitment to the generality.

Method

Binomial analysis: *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001.

Table 1 displays the rate of retention of generalities and
shows that participants prefer to retain the generalities in all
MT problems significantly more often than chance, but
preference for generalities in MP problems was not reliably
different from chance (MT: M = .84, SD = .25 and MP: M =
.54, SD = .40; F(1, 66) = 18.44, p < .001). Analysis also
revealed a significant difference in retention rates for
Problem Type, F(3, 198) = 13.98, p < .001. There was no
significant interaction between Problem Type and Logical
Structure, with both MT and MP following similar trends,
F(3, 198) = 1.28, p = .28.
Simple regression analyses were conducted to determine
if retention rates changed in relation to the Scope of the
generality (derived from the Pretest). Overall, Scope (β =
.81, p = .001) significantly predicted overall retention rates
(F(1, 10) = 19.37, p = .001, R2 = .66). Specifically, for MT
contradictions, retention of the generalities increased with
Scope (β = .89, p < .001; F(1, 10) = 37.39, p < .001, R2 =
.80). However, for MP contradictions, Scope (β = -.55, p =
.06) was a negative predictor of commitment to generalities,
F(1, 10) = 4.40, p = .06, R2 = .31.
When reasoners seek to revise true beliefs in order to
return consistency to a set of statements, they show a
stronger commitment to the generalities when the logical

Seventy-eight undergraduate students participated in this
experiment for course credit. Participants solved the same
belief revision problems used in Experiment 1, but those in
Experiment 2 introduced novel locatives for each problem.
Participants were either given MT contradictions or MP
contradictions of the same problem set to solve (betweensubjects). Participants solved 12 problems in total.

Results and Discussion
Table 2 shows the retention of generalities for Logic
Structure and Problem Type. It reveals that participants
preferred to revise beliefs by retaining the general
statements significantly more often than would be expected
by chance (50%) for each condition. As the table reveals,
reasoners show a preference in all conditions to revise
beliefs by retaining generalities. Logical Structure was
important to revisions: participants who solved MT
contradictions (M = .88, SD = .33) were more likely to
retain the generality of the problem than those who solved
MP contradictions (M = .71, SD = .34; F(1, 63) = 7.69, p =
.007). The Ontology of the statements’ relations was also
critical, with participants retaining the Definitional
generalities (M = .82, SD = .25) more often than Empirical
ones (M = .77, SD = .27; F(1, 63) = 3.62, p = .06). There
was no effect of Relation (Class vs. Property) and no
interaction among the variables in this study.
Scope was not found to be a significant predictor of
retention rates for either MT contradictions (β = .27, p =

1416

.39) or MP contradictions (β = .21, p = .51). In fact, the
trend line seen in Experiment 1 for MP problems reverses
direction (from negative to positive). This shows that
providing a locative altered the importance of Scope.

previous experiments, the retention rates of generalities in
MT contradictions were at ceiling and those of MP
contradictions were higher than previous. Such increased
retention rates overshadowed any effect of Scope, which
was not a significant predictor for MT or MP problems in
either Small or Large Proportion conditions.

Overall, the presence of a locative still allows an effect of
Logic: participants tended to retain the generality for MT
problems more often than those participants evaluating MP
problems. However, comparing across experiments, the
retention of MP generalities increased at a much higher rate
(t(64) = -2.19, p = .03) than those observed in Experiment 1,
while no change was observed in the retention rate of
generalities in the MT structures.

Experiment 3
The aim of Experiment 3 was to examine belief revisioning
in artificial environments (e.g., the locatives of Experiment
2), but with real categories, whose Scope has been modified.
Scope was expressed as either a small proportion or a large
proportion of the total members of the reasoning categories
(e.g., Kelly has a hive where 5 bees out of 104 insects have
wings vs. Logan has a honeycomb where 91 bees out of 104
insects have wings.). In Experiments 1 and 2, Scope was
implied. Here, it is explicitly stated. We anticipated that
explicitly stating the Scope of the generalities would—along
with the locatives—decouple the categorical expressions
from their normative senses and therefore make the belief
revision context more artificial.

Method
Fifty-four undergraduate students participated in this
experiment for course credit. In addition to the variables
present in the task for Experiment 2 (Logic, Ontology, and
Relation), a new between-subjects variable was added to the
problem set: Scope proportion (Small or Large). There were
four total conditions: MT Large, MT Small, MP Large, and
MP Small. Participants solved 12 belief revision problems
where Scope information was given either in a Small (5%)
or Large (87%) Proportion. The instructions and procedure
for this task were the same as Experiments 1 and 2.

Results and Discussion
Table 3 shows that participants prefer to revise their beliefs
by retaining the generality (Binomials, p < .05). Overall,
reasoners who solved MT contradictions (M = .89, SD =
.29) were slightly more likely to accept the generality of the
problem than those who solved MP contradictions (M = .77,

The locatives appear to influence the decision-making by
de-coupling the artificial context from the implicit Scope of
the categories, thus allowing increased retention of
generalities.

General Discussion
Revising our beliefs when we are confronted with
conflicting information is ubiquitous. Yet, the cognitive
processes underlying this kind of reasoning are poorly
understood because the prevailing research has not studied
belief revision with consistent content. Some tasks have
used artificial content, with no relational structure among
the beliefs. In others, the artificial beliefs have been part of
simple assertions or immersed in stories. In cases where
presumed beliefs have been used, they are often not verified.
The present study created belief revision conditions where
the meaning of the statements and the degree to which they
could be interpreted as scientific laws—their Scope—have
been independently verified along with reasoners’
commitment to them.
By controlling the Scope of statements, we were able to
identify the importance of the logical structure in which the
belief revisions are contained. In an MT structure, reasoners
prefer to revise their beliefs by retaining the most law-like
generalities and by eliminating the particular statements that
are inconsistent with the generalities. For the MT structure,
the Scope of the generalization predicts the tendency to
retain these true statements: the greater the Scope, the more
likely will the generalization be retained. In contrast, when
the epistemic structure is cast as an MP argument, reasoners
do not show a preference for generalities or facts nor does
Scope play an appreciable role.
Belief on its own is not critical to the belief revision
process. We know this because the MT problems employed
the same generalities as the MP problems, yet the former
were retained significantly more often than the latter. These

1417

findings show that critical to belief revision are the dual
factors of (a) a statement’s Scope and (b) the argument’s
structure in which the statement is immersed. Neither factor
alone is sufficient to account for how people revise a set of
beliefs. This leaves the question of why these two factors
should dictate the belief revision process.
Pursuant to David Lewis’ theory of Possible Worlds
(Lewis, 1973, 1986), we propose that when revising their
epistemic system, reasoners imagine an organized possible
world, closest to the current one. To accomplish this, they
rank-order the beliefs in terms of degrees of necessity, with
the law-like propositions given the highest ranking. In MT,
the general statement tends to be the one with the greatest
Scope and is the starting point in the revision process with
the deletion of any statement inconsistent with it. In
contrast, in MP, the assumption statement challenges the
modal status of the generality, diminishes its ranking, and
rending all statements equivalent (Rescher, 1963, 2007). As
a result, no preference for retaining any statement is
revealed. In this case, the generalizations in MP problems
do not possess the same commitment post-assumption as
they do pre-assumption. Hence, Scope is less predictive of
the decisions to retain statements in these problems.
However, when the context is rendered artificial (as with a
locative) it enhances sensitivity to the implicit modal status
of the generalization even in the MP logical structures.
The relation between believability of statements and the
logic of the belief revision context can be explained by the
Conditional Probability Hypothesis (e.g., Evans, Handley,
& Over, 2003; Wolf et al., 2012). It states that for MP
problems, the probability of the truth of the generality is
zero in the face of the counterfactual assumption. To
understand this, recall MP example (2) above:
(2a) All whales are mammals
(2b) This creature is a whale
(2c) This creature is a mammal
(2d) Assume that this creature is not a mammal
The conditional probability of the generality is stated as
P(q|p) = probability of “mammal” given the rule stated
conditionally as “if whale, then mammal”. The assumption
statement (2d) states that the probability of being a mammal
is zero. Therefore, P(q|p) = 0; therefore the probability that
the rule is true is also zero. This leads to the expectation that
there will be no discernible preference for retaining either
the generality or the particular statement in MP. In contrast,
consider the case of the MT argument repeated below:
(1a) All whales are mammals
(1b) This creature is not a mammal
(1c) This creature is not a whale
(1d) Assume that this creature is a whale
In the case where the a priori belief in the generality is
greater than zero, the assumption does not alter that.
Therefore, the preference for the generalities in this MT
structure will typically be greater than what is found for
MP. This will be true even though the general statements are
syntactically identical in the two logical structures. In brief,
the conditional probability hypothesis is able to account for

the typical finding that belief revision varies with logical
structure, all things being equal.
However, the contrasting preferences shown in
Experiments 1 and 2 are not readily explained by the
conditional probability hypothesis. The retention of the
generalities in Experiment 2 is reliably greater than those in
Experiment 1 and this is especially the case for MP. The
problems differ in the presence of a locative in Experiment
2, which is intended to reduce the law-like properties of the
generality by reminding the reasoner that the truth of these
statements may be limited in space and time. These
locatives should also reduce the a posteriori probability of
the inclusive category (e.g., “mammal”) and reduce the
retention of generalities especially in MP. The procedure
produced the opposite result. So, while the conditional
probability hypothesis has much to recommend it as an
account for belief revision, more work needs to be done to
understand the cognitive processes contributing to the
retention of beliefs.
A second account of belief revision has focused on
Disabling Conditions. The claim has been made that in the
face of the counterfactual assumption, reasoners construct
explanations for the inconsistencies (Khemlani & JohnsonLaird, 2011). These explanations focus on the
generalizations because they contain many component
elements and reasoners imagine that one of these elements
has been disabled, thereby allowing for an inconsistency.
The degree to which such disabling conditions are contrived
is indirectly related to the strength of belief in the generality.
This approach makes the following predictions: (a)
generalities will be rejected in order to retain consistency in
the epistemic set; (b) since rejection of the generalities are
based on believability, the disabling conditions (and
therefore rejection of the generality) will be equivalent
across logical structure.
These predictions are not consistent with the present
findings. Overall, generalities are retained more often than
would be expected by chance. Generalities whose Scope is
artificially low (Experiment 3) should show the effect of
disabling conditions more so than when the Scope is
artificially high, yet no difference in retention is shown for
these types of statements. While the presence of potential
disabling conditions may play a role in some aspects of
belief-revision, it is clearly not the underlying mechanism
employed for confronting the counterfactual assumptions.

Conclusion
We are obliged to revise our system of beliefs when we
accept a new piece of information that introduces an
inconsistency into our knowledge structure. Here we are
faced with the task of retaining some old information and
rejecting others. The present study examined how people
perform this task when dealing with real beliefs and facts.
Scope and Logical Structure were jointly important
predictors of whether students would retain a statement
when required to revise their epistemic sets. When the
statements fit within an MT structure, reasoners organized

1418

their revisions around the law-like generalizations. In
contrast, when the statements fit within an MP structure, the
participants did not show a preference in how they
organized their beliefs. This suggests that the importance of
belief strength is influenced by the structure in which they
are immersed.
These findings lend empirical support to the philosopher
David Lewis’ view that belief revision is characterized by
Possible Worlds logic in which reasoners structure their
revisions by organizing their epistemic systems so as to give
priority to the most law-like statements.
