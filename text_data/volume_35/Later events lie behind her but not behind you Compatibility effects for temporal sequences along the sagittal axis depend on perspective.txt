Participants
Forty-two undergraduates at the University of California,
San Diego participated for partial course credit. Eight
participants were removed due to low levels of accuracy
(<80%), leaving 36 participants for analysis.
Materials and Design
The stimuli were composed of forty pairs of typical life
events (e.g., “her/your high school graduation, her/your
college graduation”). Twenty pairs required “earlier”
judgments while twenty required “later” judgments. Stimuli
for earlier judgments were no different in length than those
presented for later judgments, p=.72.
  The experiment was programmed using E-Prime
(Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Each
participant completed a total of four blocks of forty trials of
sequential judgments. During two of the blocks, each event
was preceded with the pronoun “her” and during the other
two blocks, events were preceded with “your”. Participants
completed two blocks of trials (one block for each response
mapping) with each pronoun, followed by another two
blocks of trials using the other pronoun. Response mappings          Figure 1: Participants held one mouse in front of their body
