Design & Analysis
Out of the 522 trials in total in the main task, 4% was
excluded as failed trials; that is when the participants did not
proceed as instructed (e.g., no gesture production when right
or left hand was free), and when they did not know the
expressions. The independent variable was which hand was
free to gesture: right-hand gesturing, left-hand gesturing, not
gesturing. The dependent variable was the level of the                 Figure 3: Average metaphoricity in speech in the three
