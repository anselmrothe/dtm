types of mental contents (called participatory responses) that
fall beyond the ordinary scope of computational models of
narrative. Readers, for example, encode responses toward
characters actions and preferences for particular outcomes.
Those participatory responses vary from reader to reader and
structure their individual experiences toward narratives.
