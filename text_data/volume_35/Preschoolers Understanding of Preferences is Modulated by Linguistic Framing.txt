liking the right foods as one such norm. Indeed, liking the
right foods is an important social signal for adults (e.g.,
eating caviar or eating french-fries). Not wanting the right
foods may thus be a mistake in preschoolers' eyes in a social
sense that differs from the way they apply that term to false
facts.
   These considerations illustrate the range of cognitive
factors that underpin reasoning about preferences. Even as
children's understanding of mental lives increases through
the preschool years, many of the factors that lead to naïve
