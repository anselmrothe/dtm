ongoing turn structure with their gaze. Because some linguis-
tic units are more informative than others in predicting turn-
boundaries (e.g., words > intonation; de Ruiter et al., 2006),
we also hypothesize that, like adults, children’s online predic-
tions about turn-taking are more heavily influenced by lexical
information than they are by prosodic information. By test-
