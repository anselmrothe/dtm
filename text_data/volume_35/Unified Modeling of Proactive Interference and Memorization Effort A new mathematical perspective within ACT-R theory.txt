   For our validation, we had to make a few assumptions, as
certain information was not mentioned explicitly in the
work of Ehret (2002). The assumptions are the same across
all conditions as follows: Each practice session took 37.5
seconds to complete – since 16 sessions took 10 minutes or
600 seconds as expressed in a related work by Ehret (2000,
p. 136). We also assume the inter-session periods to be
constant. Also, except for the target pre-cue, we assume that
