   In Figure 1 we represent various possibilities for the
affective state of the participant in the PN condition. The
positive and negative affect subspaces correspond to purely
positive and negative affect respectively; they are
orthogonal, since a state in the positive affect subspace must
have a zero projection onto the negative affect one. The
positive and negative image subspaces represent the
affective impact of seeing a positive and negative image
during the experiment, respectively. These two subspaces
are also nearly orthogonal since the images were chosen to
be unrelated. Note that, in this example, the positive image
subspace is close to the positive affect one, since perceiving
a positive image is more likely to lead to a positive affect
(the state vector created as a result of perceiving the positive
image has a large projection to the positive affect subspace).
   In the single rating condition, after perceiving the positive
image, the state vector is aligned with the positive image
subspace. The impact of introducing the negative image is
represented by a rotation of the state vector, denoted as U,
which leads to the state labeled as ‘PN single rating’. The
subsequent projection to the negative affect subspace is a
measure of how negative we expect the resulting rating to
be (the thick line along the bad feeling subspace).
Specifically, the squared length of the projection of the
mixed image state onto the negative affect subspace
determines the probability of a negative rating; it is natural
to assume that the higher this probability, the more negative

   In the double rating condition, after perceiving the
positive image, the intermediate rating is assumed to lead to
a transition to the positive affect subspace. This is the
