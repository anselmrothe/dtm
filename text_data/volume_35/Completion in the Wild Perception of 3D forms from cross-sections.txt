understanding of amodal completion. Take for example the
image shown in Figure 1. There is little doubt that the dark
brown region (cinnamon swirl) is 3D and extends into the
object, however from this 2-dimensional (2D) view or cross-
section, the 3D shape is unknowable (note even if you knew
the true 3D shape the answer would still be ambiguous
within a mirror reflection because the image could come
from either side of a cut). In order to infer the 3D shape of
the region, one would have to have a view of the region
from another side. Inferring shape from partial information
is particularly important for disciplines that rely on 3D
visualization (e.g., astronomy, neuroscience, geosciences).
However, a common sentiment echoed by geoscientists and
noted by Kali & Orion (1996) for geological stimuli, is that
students neglect the ambiguity inherent in a single 2D view
and instead are biased to assume that surface boundaries
extend perpendicularly into solids.
