Abstract
Under conditions where an object is inside another object
and only a single face is visible, is there a bias to assume
smooth continuation of the surface straight back into the
object? To examine the ability to estimate how features
progress into a volume, participants viewed 16 pictures of
everyday objects (rocks, food, wood) presented with only a
single face visible (see Figure 1). Participants reported
whether a highlighted region of a picture was present on the
surface or extended into the object. If they perceived the
region as extending in, they positioned a rod to indicate the
angle. Surface responses were rare and instead participants’
readily perceived 3D forms from 2D views. Inspection of
frequency histograms revealed a systematic bias to estimate
the angle of extension in the 80-110 range. This type of
completion process suggests constraints on models of visual
completion and has implications for STEM education, in
particular, how students deal with ambiguity.

Introduction
How does the visual system estimate 3-dimensional (3D)
forms of objects embedded in other objects? While this
question has received very little empirical attention
(Chariker, Naaz, & Pani, 2011; Hegarty, Keehner, Cohen,
Montello, & Lippa, 2007), we believe it is central to our
understanding of amodal completion. Take for example the
image shown in Figure 1. There is little doubt that the dark
brown region (cinnamon swirl) is 3D and extends into the
object, however from this 2-dimensional (2D) view or crosssection, the 3D shape is unknowable (note even if you knew
the true 3D shape the answer would still be ambiguous
within a mirror reflection because the image could come
from either side of a cut). In order to infer the 3D shape of
the region, one would have to have a view of the region
from another side. Inferring shape from partial information
is particularly important for disciplines that rely on 3D
visualization (e.g., astronomy, neuroscience, geosciences).
However, a common sentiment echoed by geoscientists and
noted by Kali & Orion (1996) for geological stimuli, is that
students neglect the ambiguity inherent in a single 2D view
and instead are biased to assume that surface boundaries
extend perpendicularly into solids.

The goal of this paper was twofold: 1) to examine
whether people recognize that the 3D form of an object is
unknowable from a single 2D view and 2) to examine
whether participants do indeed exhibit a bias to assume
smooth continuation of a surface straight back into the solid
as suggested by the anecdotal reports of geoscience
educators.
To answer this question we showed undergraduate
psychology majors pictures of everyday objects such as
food, rocks and wood. For each picture, a region was
indicated with a colored line, as shown in Figure 1 top.
Students indicated if the highlighted region was visible only
on the surface or whether it extended into the object. Note
that the answer to this question is in fact unknowable.
While some of the objects are familiar to viewers (kiwi,
bread, etc) and thus the overall shape of the object can be
inferred, one cannot know how the cut was made or for
unfamiliar objects, whether the indicated region continues
into the object or is present only on the surface. To infer the
3D shape one would have to see more than one 2D crosssection of the object. If students saw the indicated region as
extending in, they used a rod attached to an inclinometer to
indicate the angle at which the region continued into the
object (the correct answer for the bread is shown in Figure 1
bottom). We predicted that participants would have a strong
sense that the indicated regions were 3D and would exhibit
a bias to see the regions as extending back at a 90 angle
relative to the ground surface.

Method
Participants. Participants were 30 Temple University
Undergraduates.
Stimuli. The stimuli consisted of 17 color photographs of
common objects such as food, wood and rocks. There was
one practice image and 16 experimental images. For each
picture we selected a specific region of the picture to ask
participants about. As shown in Figure 1, this region was
indicated with a red line. In each image the area represented
a region where a plane might intersect the visible surface.
For example in Figure 1, the plane defined by the cinnamon
layer between two regions of dough is indicated. Images
when presented on the screen were approximately 25 x 18
cm.
These categories of images were chosen with two
constraints: 1) that we were physically able to slice each
object and measure the angle at which each highlighted
region extended into the object and 2) that we sample a
range of objects that might be familiar to participants.
Our stimuli fell into six broad categories defined by their
internal structure: 1) rocks (granite slab), 2) wood (tree ring
and a knot), 3) fruits (pineapple, papaya, kiwi), 4) vegetable
(onion), 5) animals (fish and beef) and 6) food products that
were originally liquid and are now solid (blue cheese,
chocolate with almonds and cinnamon bread). These
categories were selected because the internal structure
ranged from highly structured and constrained by the
environment (e.g., wood grain) to relatively unconstrained
(e.g., minerals in rock) and thus the orientation is either
knowable within a certain range or completely unknowable.
For example, the internal structure of wood is constrained
by the environment. As tree structures are generally
concentric cylinders, the extension into a slice is a function
of the angle of the cut relative to the cylinders. For the fruit
stimuli we selected fruits with radial symmetry and thus the
internal structure is also structured. An onion although
somewhat irregular in shape, has an organized internal
structure. For the fish and beef stimuli we asked about how
regions of fat extend in. Fat deposits are structured in
complex ways by the surrounding muscles and thus
organized but not to the same degree as wood, or fruit. The
internal composition of rocks can be structured, but the
orientation of a mineral’s surface relative to the cutting
plane is essentially arbitrary.
Apparatus. Stimuli were presented on a 20-inch Dell
monitor. As shown in Figure 2, the monitor was positioned
parallel to the ground.

Figure 2: The display used in the experiment. Participants
used the black rod to indicate the orientation at which the
highlighted region extended into the object.
Procedure. Participants were tested individually. They
viewed each picture while standing with their nose over the
center of the monitor. Participants were told that we were
interested in their opinions of how regions of images
continue in 3-dimensions. They were told that sometimes
they would see pictures where they might have a strong
sense that a region continued and sometimes they might
have a sense that something was present only on the surface.
To illustrate these cases, students were shown a picture of a
Swiss roll and crayon marks on paper. All students reported
seeing the layers of the Swiss roll as extending into the
object while the crayon marks were present on the surface.
Participants were shown 16 pictures. For each, their task
was to indicate whether the region indicated with the red
line was present only on the surface or extended into the
object. If they thought it extended into the object, they used
a stainless steel rod with an inclinometer (angle measure)
attached to indicate the orientation of continuation.
Participants placed the edge of the rod on the red line and
then moved the rod up and down to indicate the angle. The
0° was defined relative to the ground plane (i.e. if positioned
the rod to indicate straight down, as shown in Figure 2, the
angle measurement was 90°). After they estimated the
angle, they reported their confidence in their response on a
5-point scale. Prior to viewing the 16 pictures participants
practiced using the angle measurement device on the image
of the Swiss roll. To be sure that there were not differences
in the estimates based on the orientation of the picture, after
viewing all the pictures and making their responses
participants were shown the 16 pictures again but this time
the images were rotated 180 degrees. This allowed us to
calculate any bias due to their body position relative to the
image. Finally, participants were shown the pictures a third
time and asked to identify each picture. For any response
with a confidence rating of 0 or 1, we further probed their
uncertainty. Participants were asked to select which of the
following reasons best described why they were uncertain in
their response: 1) they have no idea what it could be, 2) the
answer is unknowable 3) there could have been a range of
possible angles. Additionally, for the pictures that they

2351

selected surface for, we told them that the region did extend
in and asked them if they could make a guess about its
orientation using the rod (note these estimates were not
included in any analyses). After this, participants completed
the Geologic Block Slicing Test (a measure of inferring
internal spatial structures from views of multiple sides;
Ormand et al, 2011), Spatial Orientation Test (Kozhevnikov
& Hegarty, 2001) and the Mental Rotations Test (Shepard &
Metzler, 1971). Data for these spatial tests are not presented
in this paper.
Results
Although the single 2D view is insufficient to define a 3D
shape, participants reported that the answer was unknowable
on only 1% of the trials (12 times out of 960 trials),
suggesting that participants do not recognize the need for
multiple views to solve the intersection of constraints
problem. Consistent with this, participants were confident
in their angle estimates. The mean confidence was 3.2 (SD
= 1.1) on a 5-point scale. Participants did perceive some of
the highlighted regions as being only on the surface, but this
was the case on only 26% of the trials, suggesting that
participants tended to perceive the highlighted regions as
extending into the object in three dimensions.
In order to calculate the participant’s unbiased estimate
for each picture, the two estimates were combined by
calculating the average of the first estimate and 180° minus
the second estimate. By presenting each picture in two
orientations, we could remove any bias that a participant
had to orient the rod towards (or away from) their body. For
example, consider a case where the estimate for the first
view and the second view (when the picture was rotated
180°) of a picture was 80°. If the participant were truly
responding with an unbiased estimate, this would mean that
if the estimate for the first view was 80°, the estimate for the
second view should have been 100°. Thus, by subtracting
the second estimate from 180, we can avoid any systematic
bias (overall participants exhibited an ~4 degree bias
towards their body).
Figure 3 shows the mean angle estimate without bias for
each picture along with the 95% confidence interval for that
picture. Inspection of the figure reveals that mean estimates
tended to be biased towards 90. Fifteen of the 16 pictures
have mean estimates that are not significantly different from
90° (the red line denotes 90°). The only picture that has a
mean estimate significantly greater than 90° was the
“onion” picture.

show 95% confidence interval for each mean.

Error bars

Next we examine whether the distribution of responses
for each picture was random or whether there was a
preferred direction for the distribution. Surface responses
were excluded from this analysis. Thus the N for each
picture varies based on the number of estimates for that
picture. To examine the structure of the distributions we
conducted the Rayleigh test (Zar, 1999) using the EZ Rose
program (Baas, 2000). The null hypothesis is that the
distribution of responses are randomly distributed around a
semicircle. If the null is rejected then the distribution of
responses has a preferred direction. To examine whether
the null is accepted or rejected one compares R (mean
vector length) for each picture to the critical value of the test
statistic R0.05 (see Baas, 2000 equation 10). If R is greater
than R0.05 then the distribution of responses has a preferred
direction (i.e. is not random). As can be seen in Table 1 the
Rayleigh test was rejected for 14 of the 16 pictures. For the
“Tree Knot” and Papaya pictures, participants tended to
perceive the region as on the surface (44% and 58% were
judged to be “on surface,” respectively). Thus the number of
estimates was less than the 15 recommend for this test
(Baas, 2000). However, an inspection of the frequency
distributions (see below) reveals that when estimates were
made, they centered around 90°.

Finally, we examined whether the mean estimates
centered around 90 because some participants estimated
the angle at 10 and others at 170 and this averaged out to
90 or whether there was consistency among estimates for
all participants. Figure 4 shows the frequency distribution
for response for each of the 16 pictures grouped by
category. As can be seen in the figure, the distributions are
fairly uniform. There are certain pictures, for example the
papaya, where participants on averaged perceived the
indicated region to be on the surface (thus number of
estimates is smaller). However, there were other pictures,
like the kiwi and bread where participants agreed the region
extended in. Also evident in the distributions is the limited
spread. Mean estimates did not encompass the entire 0-180
spectrum; instead on average they were concentrated around
90.

Discussion
Two conclusions can be drawn from this work.
The first is that participants failed to recognize that one
cannot know the orientation of a 3D structure from a single
2D view.
Instead of recognizing that this situation is
ambiguous, participants tended to have consistent intuitions
about how regions of pictures extend in 3D into the object.
The second conclusion that can be drawn from these
findings is that participant’s estimates tended to be clustered
around 90, suggesting that estimates were biased to assume
that the surface continues straight back into the object.
These findings 1) suggest possible constraints on models of
amodal completion processes and 2) have implications for
STEM education, in particular, challenges that arise when
students do not recognize ambiguity. We consider each of
these in turn.
In developing our understanding of how the visual system
estimates the 3D form of objects, there are important
completion phenomena that should constrain computational
models. Here we describe a completion phenomenon that to
our knowledge has not been recognized -- participants
readily perceived 3D forms from 2D views (of both familiar
and unfamiliar objects) and the perception is that surface
boundaries extend perpendicularly into a solid.
This bias may be informative about the filling out process
that occur under conditions where the 3D completion of
surfaces can not occur because the edges of an object are not
aligned in the 2D projection on the retina (see Tse, 1999).
The bias evident in this study may be a product of the way
the visual system handles a more common instance of
having partial information about an object – when viewed
head-on. Normally, if one can only see a single side of an
object, it is a result of your current viewpoint (the line-ofsight is perpendicular to the front face). So, the visual
system may represent the portions of the occluded object
using past experience (i.e. knowledge about cinnamon swirl
bread) or some properties of the front face. This process
becomes evident when the object (the cinnamon swirl) is
surrounded by an opaque region (more bread) and thus other
sides are not visible to the observer. The visual system is
not flummoxed by this situation but instead rapidly
extrapolates from the available single surface to represent an
extended 3D structure. Under these conditions, the
completion process reflects the assumption that edges on the
surface project straight into the object.
Our observations suggest the existence of a visual
process that uses available visual information to extend
form representations into regions where the form is not
visible. Models of visual completion argue that completion
processes reflect the system’s attempt to construct a
representation of the most likely 3D form. An ongoing
debate in the literature has examined whether completion
processes occur as a result of extrapolation (filling out) or
interpolation (filling in). Here, where only one face of a 3D

2354

form is visible, the completion processes must be based on
extrapolation - filling out from available visual information
(Shipley & Kellman, 2003) – rather than interpolation
between defined regions. Extrapolation occurs in both
amodal (Kanizsa, 1979) and modal displays (Shipley &
Kellman, 2003), but previous demonstrations have been
extrapolation of planes or edges, not 3D volumes.
In addition to informing our understanding of visual
completion processes, these results have important
implications for STEM education. Consider a field geology
student examining a rock face and trying to make inferences
about its 3D structure, or an anatomy student learning where
best to make an incision during dissection or surgery. Both
of these tasks require inferences about a 3D form from a 2D
view. What is critical in both these cases is that an accurate
estimate of the orientation of the 3D form requires more
information – either in the form of looking at another angle
of the rock to see how features penetrate in, or knowing
something about the true 3D shape and using that to
constrain the estimate of orientation of how the region
extends into the volume. There are aspects of the world that
might place constraints on the probable internal structure
(i.e. grains in wood has a cylindrical structure), however
students must recognize the need to seek out additional
information in order to make inferences about the 3D
structure.
An extensive body of research has examined decisionmaking regarding uncertain events (Kahnamen, & Tversky
1982), however to our knowledge work in this area has not
examined uncertain perceptual situations and their
relationships to confusion in the classroom. We believe this
is an interesting area to pursue in future research. How best
to convey to students that information in an image may
appear to determinant, but is in fact ambiguous.
Our aim in this paper is threefold: first, examine
3D completion from 2D views and to bring this type of
process to the attention of the research community. By
making researchers aware of completion processes in the
“wild”, we hope to begin a dialogue that may move
completion research forward into new domains. Second, to
expand the phenomena considered by any model of visual
completion. Third, we wish to illustrate the importance of
scaffolding student’s ability to recognize ambiguity and the
necessity to seek out additional information for solving a
problem.
