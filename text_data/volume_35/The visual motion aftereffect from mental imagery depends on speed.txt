   Data from the remaining 21 participants was submitted to
a mixed-models logistic regression. The model included
fixed-effect parameters for coherence of the test stimulus,
direction of adaptation, speed of the adapting stimulus
(Helmert coded), and trial number. The model also included
terms for the interaction between adaptation direction and
motion speed, as well as adaptation direction and trial
number. This last interaction term was included to account
for longitudinal shifts in the aftereffect due to accumulation
of adaptation and fatigue. Finally, the model included
random slopes by participant for the full fixed-effects
structure.
Results
Figure 1 shows the raw, unfitted means across participants
for upward and downward adaptation separately (including
participants whose data was not in the direction of an
MAE). In this inclusive sample, participants showed a
164.5% shift between the motion response functions in the
direction of adaptation.        This difference was highly
significant, β=-4.63, Z=-7.37, p<0.00001.
   Next we tested whether speed modulated the magnitude
of the aftereffect in people who responded in the direction
of adaptation overall.        Indeed, viewing slow motion
produced a smaller MAE than did viewing medium or fast
motion (β=-2.31, Z=-4.68, p<0.00001). This corresponded
with a 12% per deg/s increase in the probability of
experiencing an MAE on a given trial. However, the
increase in the MAE from viewing fast motion compared to
medium motion was much smaller (0.65% per deg/s), and
this shift did not reach significance (β=-0.17, Z=-0.38,
