   Does the typicality of an object affect how we identify it?
   When we produce initial reference to a visible object, we are
   influenced by a variety of factors, including what is visually
   salient (bottom-up influences) as well as our previous experi-
   ences with the object (top-down influences). In this study, we
   seek to understand how the top-down influence of typicality
   affects initial reference to an object. We use real world, every-
   day objects, and focus on the visual properties of SHAPE and                (a) A GRE3D3 scene.         (b) A TUNA scene.

   select the atypical over the typical. But we have only begun to
