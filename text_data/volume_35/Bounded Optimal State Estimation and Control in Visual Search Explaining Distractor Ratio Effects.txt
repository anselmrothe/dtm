sions: 1) where to next fixate and 2) when to issue a task re-
sponse. Both the estimation and control processes are adapted
to the simultaneous constraints of the vision system and the
task at hand.
   The structure of this model affords the formulation and ex-
ploration of a number of interesting theoretical questions con-
cerning visual search phenomena. In this paper, we use mod-
eling to determine whether distractor ratio effects are signa-
tures of optimal state estimation, optimal control, (or both),
and to identify the constraints of the visual system that are
necessary for the effect to arise. To foreshadow the two key
results, the model demonstrates (1) that distractor ratio effects
may be understood as adaptation to changes in proportions of
task-relevant environment features, and that these effects are
signatures of optimal state estimation (not control) in the face
of spatial uncertainty in the parafovea; and (2) that saccadic
bias may be understood as a signature of both optimal control
and optimal state estimation in the face of spatial uncertainty.
   In the following sections we first discuss efficient visual
search in the distractor ratio paradigm and introduce the
boundedly optimal adaptive visibility model. We next discuss
model results and their implications.
