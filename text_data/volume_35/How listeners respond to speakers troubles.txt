Fifty four participants (30 Male, 24 Female) were re-
cruited to the study through advertising on local com-
munity websites. Of those who responded to the ad-
vertisement, 40% participated. Participants within each
group had not met prior to the study.
Procedure
Participants were brought into the laboratory in threes
and seated in a triangular formation so that each par-
ticipant had good visual access to each of the others
(see Figure 1). The researcher read aloud a fictional
moral dilemma scenario called ‘the balloon task’ to the
seated group. The scenario states that there are four
people in a hot air balloon, which is losing height and
about to crash into some mountains killing all on board.
One person must jump from the ballon to their certain
death in order to save the other three. Participants were
instructed to debate the reasons for and against each
person being saved, and reach mutual agreement about
who should jump. The group was provided with an op-              Figure 2: The wire frame representation of the interac-
