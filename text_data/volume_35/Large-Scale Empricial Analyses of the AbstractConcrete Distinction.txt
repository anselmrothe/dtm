predicts association for concrete concepts to a greater extent
than for abstract concepts. In Analysis 3, we show that freeassociation is a more symmetric relation for abstract
concepts than for concrete concepts. The findings together
suggest contrasts in both the organization and representation
of abstract and concrete concepts. We conclude by
discussing the implications of the findings for existing
theories and models of conceptual representation.

Abstract
We present original evidence that abstract and concrete
concepts are organized and represented differently, based on
statistical analyses of thousands of concepts in publicly
available datasets. First, we show that abstract and concrete
concepts have differing patterns of association with other
concepts. Second, we test recent hypotheses that abstract
concepts are organized according to association, whereas
concrete concepts are organized according to (semantic)
similarity. Third, we present evidence suggesting that
concrete representations are more strongly feature-based than
abstract representations. We argue that degree of featurebased structure may fundamentally determine concreteness,
and discuss implications for cognitive and computational
models of meaning.

Data
Our analyses exploit three publicly available resources
compiled to assist psychological modeling and analysis.
USF Norms All three experimental analyses use the
University of South Florida (USF) Free-association Norms
(Nelson & McEvoy, 2012). The USF data consists of over
5,000 words and their associates. In compiling the data,
more than 6,000 participants were presented with cue words
and asked to “write the first word that comes to mind that is
meaningfully related or strongly associated to the presented
word”. For a cue word c and an associate a, the Forward
Association Probability (FAP) from c to a is the proportion
of participants who produced a when presented with c. FAP
is thus a measure of the strength of an associate relative to
other associates of that cue.
Many of the cues and associates in the USF data have a
concreteness score, derived from either the norms of Paivio,
Yuille and Madigan (1968) or Toglia and Battig (1978). In
both cases contributors were asked to rate words based on a
scale of 1 (very abstract) to 7 (very concrete). 2

Keywords: Concreteness; concepts; similarity; association.

Introduction
A large body of empirical evidence indicates important
cognitive differences between abstract concepts, such as
guilt or obesity, and concrete concepts, such as chocolate or
cheeseburger. It has been shown that concrete concepts are
more easily learned and remembered than abstract concepts,
and that language referring to concrete concepts is more
easily processed (Schwanenflugel, 1991). Moreover, there
are cases of brain damage in which either abstract or
concrete concepts appear to be specifically impaired
(Warrington, 1975).
In addition, functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) studies implicate overlapping but
partly distinct neural systems in the processing of the two
concept types (Binder et al., 2005). Despite these widely
known findings, however, there is little consensus on the
cognitive
basis
of
the
observed
differences
(Schwanenflugel, 1991). Indeed, while many studies of
conceptual representation and organization focus on
concrete domains, comparatively little has been established
empirically about abstract concepts.1
In this paper we test various theoretical claims concerning
the abstract/concrete distinction by exploiting large
publicly-available experimental datasets and computational
resources. By analyzing thousands of abstract and concrete
concepts, our approach marginalizes potential confounds
more robustly than in smaller-scale behavioral studies. In
Analysis 1 we show that abstract concepts are associated in
the mind to a wider range of other concepts, although the
degree of this association is typically weaker than for
concrete concepts. In Analysis 2 we explore the basis of
these associations by testing the hypothesis that similarity

WordNet WordNet is a tree-based lexical ontology
containing over 155,000 words produced manually by
researchers at Princeton University (Felbaum, 1998). The
present work used WordNet version 3.0.
Brown Corpus Word frequencies were extracted from the
one million-word Brown Corpus (Kucera & Francis, 1967),
chosen because it is an American corpus compiled at a
similar time to the USF data. Word tokens in the Brown
Corpus are tagged for their part of speech (POS). For a
word type it is then possible to extract the majority POS (the
POS with which the type is most frequently tagged).

Although concreteness is well understood intuitively, it lacks a
universally accepted definition. It is often described in terms of
reference to sensory experience (Paivio et al., 1968), but also
connected to specificity; rose is often considered more concrete
than flora. The present work does not address this ambiguity.

Analyses
Each of our analyses is motivated by characteristics of the
abstract/concrete distinction proposed in theoretical and
behavioral studies.

We have shown that abstract words have more associates
than concrete words and lower variance in FAP
distributions. This is consistent with the idea that the
strength of their associates is on average weaker than for
concrete words. Fig. 1 represents the strength of this effect
visually. Whilst this confirmation of H1 is consistent with
Schwanenflugel‟s Context Availability model, it is also
consistent with other theoretical characterizations of the
abstract/concrete distinction (Paivio, 1986; Markman and
Stilwell, 2001). We thus investigate the distinction in more
detail in Analyses 2 and 3.

Analysis 1: Patterns of Association
Motivation Schwanenflugel‟s Context Availability Model
(1991) offers a theoretical basis for the aforementioned
empirical abstract/concrete differences. Her exposition of
the model relies on the following hypothesis:3
(H1) Abstract concepts have more (but weaker)
connections (to other concepts) than concrete concepts.
Schwanenflugel presents only small-scale behavioral
experiments (64 words, 40 participants) in support of H1.
In Analysis 1 we test H1 on a far larger data set.

Method We extracted those 3,255 pairs in the USF data for
which the concreteness of the cue-word was known. Since
cue words are connected to a finite set of associates by FAP
values, we can isolate a probability distribution over
associates for each cue. Since our measure of association
strength (FAP) is relative, it is not possible to compare these
strengths directly across cue words. Nonetheless, we can
make inferences about absolute cue associate strength from
properties of the FAP distributions. If a cue has many
associates with little variance in the FAP distribution, each
FAP value must necessarily be low (and absolute
association strength intuitively weak). In contrast, for a
given number of associates, higher variance implies that
some FAP values are notably higher than the mean, and
thus likely to be strong absolutely. Therefore, to address
H1 we considered both the dimension (number of
associates) and the variance of the FAP distribution for
each cue word.
In an initial analysis of the data, we noted a moderate
but significant negative correlation between concreteness
and frequency, r(3255) = -.16, p < .001. Therefore, a
multiple regression analysis was conducted with
log(Frequency), Number of Associates and Variance of
FAP as predictors, and Concreteness as dependent
variable.
Because the Concreteness/Frequency
multicolinearity was exacerbated by high frequency
abstract prepositions and verbs, a second analysis was
conducted solely over cue words with majority POS
„noun‟ (n = 2,320).

Results and Discussion In both cases the regression model
explained 17% of the variance of Concreteness and was
statistically significant. The beta coefficients in Table 1
indicate that concreteness correlates negatively with both
#Associates and FAP Variance. Both are highly significant

Analysis 2: Distinct Conceptual Organization?
Motivation Based on recent behavioral studies of healthy
and brain-damaged subjects, (see e.g. Crutch et al., 2009),
Crutch and colleagues argue that abstract and concrete
concepts differ “qualitatively” in how they relate to other
concepts. More specifically, they propose the following:

abstract words come to have weaker connections [to associated
information]...only that they generally do” (1991, p. 243).

according to similarity whilst abstract concepts are
organized according to association.

and mirrors the manual approach taken by Markman &
Wisniewski (1997). For this experiment, SIM, a measure of
the similarity of two words w1 and w2 on the range [0, 1],
was defined as the maximum PathSim between all senses of
w1 and all senses of w2. Since verbs, adjectives and nouns
occupy separate taxonomic structures in WordNet, PathSim
does not effectively measure similarity across these
categories. We thus restrict our analysis to those 18,672
pairs in the FAP data for which cue concreteness and FAP
are known and the majority POS for both words is „noun‟.
As a pre-test, SIM was evaluated on Rubinstein and
Goodenough‟s (1965) similarity data for 65 word pairs,4
previously used as a benchmark for automatic similarity
measures. The correlation between these judgments and
SIM, r(63) = .77, p < .05, was comparable to other more
complex WordNet metrics such as Resnik‟s (1995)
Information Content, r(63) = .79, p < .05, and approaching
the human replication baseline, r(63) = .90 (Resnik, 1995).

The terms association and similarity refer to the ways the
concept pairs [car, bike] and [car, petrol] are related: Car is
said to be semantically similar to bike, and associated with
(but not similar to) petrol. Intuitively, car and bike may be
understood as similar because of their common physical
features (wheels), their common function (transport), or
because they fall within a clearly definable category (modes
of transport). By contrast, car and petrol may be associated
because they often occur together or because of the
functional relationship between them. The two relations are
neither mutually exclusive nor independent; bike and car are
related to some degree by both association and similarity.
In support of H2, Crutch et al. (2009) asked 20
participants to select the odd-one-out from lists of five
words appearing on a screen. The lists comprised either
concrete or abstract words (based on ratings of six
informants) connected either by similarity (e.g. dog, wolf,
fox etc.; theft, robbery, stealing etc.) or association (dog,
bone, collar etc.; theft, law, victim etc.), with an unrelated
odd-one-out item in each list. Controlling for frequency and
position, subjects were both significantly faster and more
accurate if the related words were either abstract and
associated or concrete and similar. These results support H2
on the basis that decision times are faster when the related
items form a more coherent group, rendering the odd-oneout more salient.
Despite the consistency in these findings, each of Crutch
et al.‟s experiments tested a small sample of subjects (< 20)
with a small (< 20) number of concepts. It is therefore
possible that the observed differences resulted from
semantic factors particular to the subjects and items but
independent of concreteness. Analysis 2 exploits the USF
data and WordNet to investigate H2 more thoroughly.

Results and Discussion As detailed in Table 2, the
regression model was significant, F(2, 3252) = 194.53, and,
as expected, SIM was a significant predictor of FAP. The
interaction term SIM:Concreteness was positive, as
predicted by H2, and a significant predictor of FAP.

The positive interaction between similarity and concreteness
in our model lends some support to H2. However, the size
of this effect is small: the model explains less than .1 of a
percentage point more variance in FAP than a model with
no interaction term. While statistically significant, this
difference is not consistent with a “qualitative difference” in
conceptual organization between abstract and concrete
concepts, as Crutch and Warrington (2005) propose.
Rather, our analysis supports a gradual contrast in patterns
of organization along a continuum from concrete to abstract.
Of course, qualitative or categorical differences may exist
that are too subtle to be detected by the current method. We
intend to examine this possibility in future work, using the
USF data and WordNet to generate appropriate items for
larger-scale behavioral experiments.

Method
Because similarity and association are not
mutually exclusive, H2 can be interpreted in terms of
differing interactions between these two relation types. If
concrete concepts are organized in the mind to a greater
extent than abstract concepts according to similarity, then
the associates of a given concrete concept should be more
similar to that concept than the associates of a given abstract
concept. In other words, there should be greater correlation
between similarity and association over concrete concepts
than abstract. We test for this effect with a multiple
regression over cue-associate pairs, with FAP as dependent
variable and Concreteness, Similarity and their interaction
as predictors. Relevant to H2 is the presence or absence of a
positive interaction between concreteness and similarity.
Following other studies of conceptual structure
(Markman & Wisniewski, 1997), we model similarity as
proximity in a conceptual taxonomy, in this case, WordNet.
Various measures of similarity have been developed for
WordNet (see e.g. Resnik, 1995). PathSim, based on the
shortest path between two senses, is perhaps the simplest,

of representation mentioned previously, Tversky‟s
demonstrations are typically confined to concrete words.
Nevertheless, his conclusions could be aligned with H2
(Analysis 2) if the following hypothesis held:

organization.
With respect to the differences in
representation that cause the H2 effect, Crutch and
Warrington offer only speculative hypotheses.
For
instance, they suggest that that “abstract concepts are
represented in associative neural networks”, whilst
“concrete concepts have a categorical organization”
(Crutch & Warrington, 2005, p. 624). Weimer-Hastings and
Xu (2005) address this question empirically, and find that
people tend to generate fewer “intrinsic” and proportionally
more “relational” properties for abstract concepts.
Nevertheless, given the untimed, conscious nature of their
feature-generation task, and the fact they test only 31
subjects with 36 concepts, the strength of their findings is
limited in a similar way to those of Crutch et al. In Analysis
3 we test for evidence of specific representational
differences that could explain H2 and the other concreteness
effects detailed in the Introduction.
Although the limitations of classical theories of
representation with strict binary property specifications are
well known, many recent theories characterize
representations as feature-based in a more dynamic sense
(see e.g. Plaut & Shallice, 1993). Indeed, the idea of
concepts as complexes of conceptually basic features
underlines explanations of various empirical observations,
including typicality effects, category learning and categoryspecific semantic impairments (Tyler et al. 1995).
Feature-based models are not ubiquitous. Competing
approaches such as spatial models (See e.g. Shepard, 1957)
or associative networks (Steyvers & Tennembaum, 2005)
have also captured various established cognitive
phenomena. One criticism of such models, however, is they
naturally model relatedness with a symmetric operation: for
all concepts x and y, relatedness(x,y) = relatedness(y,x). As
often observed, (Griffiths, et al., 2007; Tversky, 1977)
empirical measures of conceptual promixity are in general
asymmetric. For instance, it is common to find concept
pairs X and Y for which subjects judge the statement „X is
like Y‟ to be more acceptable than „Y is like X‟. This effect
can be particularly evident when one concept is more salient
or prototypical than the other („Justin Bieber is like Elvis‟
vs. ‟Elvis is like Justin Bieber‟?). Asymmetries are also
observed in priming effects and free-association, for
instance with category name/member or whole/part pairs
(Alsatian primes dog more than dog primes Alsatian).
A noted strength of feature-based models is that they
naturally capture the asymmetry of semantic relations. In
the Contrast Model, Tversky (1977) proposes that the
similarity of conceptual representations is computed as
some continuous function of their common and distinctive
features.
Such operations are generally asymmetric,
particularly given a disparity in the number of features. For
instance, suppose the concept jackal is represented with the
features {4LEGS, FUR, HOWLS} and the concept dog with
the features {4LEGS, FUR, TAIL, COLLAR, LOYAL,
DOMESTIC}. Tversky argues that it is more natural to say
that jackals are like dogs than vice versa because two thirds
of jackal features are shared by dog, whereas only one third
of dog features are shared by jackal. As with other theories

(H3) Concrete representations have a high degree of
feature-based structure. Abstract representations do not.
Indeed, the soundness of H3 could point to a causal
explanation of the H2 effect. By H3, computing the
similarity of abstract concepts by mapping features would
be relatively hard. Alternative types of relation would thus
be required to group sets of abstract concepts in the mind.
Proposals similar to H3 have been made by several
researchers.
Plaut and Shallice (1993) showed that
integrating differential degrees of feature-based structure
into connectionist simulations of dyslexia leads to more
accurate replication of established concrete word
advantages. Additionally, Markman and Stilwell‟s (2001)
analysis of conceptual category subtypes is entirely
consistent with H3. On this view, feature-based categories
include those noun concepts typically considered very
concrete, whereas abstract noun, prepositions and verbs are
all relational categories. Feature-based categories are
represented by some configuration of (featural) information
„subordinate to‟ or „contained within‟ that representation (p.
330), whereas relational categories are defined by external
information, such as the position of the representation in a
relational structure. Finally, H3 is also compatible with the
feature-generation data of Weimer-Hastings and Xu (2005).
In Analysis 3 we exploit the USF data to test a prediction
of H3. If Tversky‟s demonstration that asymmetry derives
from features is sound, there should be greater asymmetry
between concrete concepts than between abstract concepts.
Method Although Tversky‟s reasoning pertains to a
similarity relation, we use the USF data to explore
asymmetries in association. Similarity is an important
factor in association in general, as evidenced by the high
SIM/FAP correlation (Analysis 2).
We thus expect
asymmetries deriving from similarity to be reflected in FAP
values, noting that asymmetry of free-association has been
observed previously (Michelbaker et al., 2011).
For each of the 18,668 ordered cue-associate pairs [c,a]
for which the concreteness of c and a is known, we calculate
the (additive) asymmetry |FAP[c,a] – FAP[a,c]|. We define
the total cue asymmetry, CueAsymm(c), as the sum of the
additive asymmetries over all associates of that cue. For a
given cue item in our analysis, we experiment with three
different measures of concreteness. The first is the cue
concreteness Conc(c). Since Tversky‟s explanation of
asymmetry relies on both concepts having a feature-based
representation, for each pair [c,a] we also calculate both the
sum and the product of concreteness scores. We then define
ConcSum(c) as the sum of the sums over all associates,
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑆𝑢𝑚 𝑐 = 𝑎 Conc c + Conc a , and ConcProd(c) as
the sum of products 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑 𝑐 = 𝑎 Conc c Conc a . To
control for the possibility that FAP asymmetries are caused
exclusively by a disparity in frequency between cue and

582

associate, we also define the measure FreqDisp(c); the sum
of the absolute differences between the frequency of a cue
word and that of each of its associates, 𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑞𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑝 𝑐 =
𝑎 Freq a − Freq(c) . We analyse the relationship between
CueAsymm (dependent variable) and the three measures of
concreteness (predictors) in separate multiple regression
models, with FreqDisp as an independent predictor in each.

significantly greater than when both are not (.066), t(9351.3)
= 2.78, p < .01. Together with Tversky‟s analysis, these
observations are consistent with Markman and Stilwell‟s
proposal that many noun representations are feature-based
whereas representations of verbs and prepositions rely on
features to a lesser extent.

Results and Discussion The results in Table 3 show a
significant positive correlation between the concreteness
measure and CueAsymm in all three models, confirming the
prediction of H3. Moreover, the model with ConcProd (R2
= 13.73) accounts for more of the CueAsymm variance than
with ConcSum (R2 = .12), which in turn accounts for more
than with Conc (R2 = .08). These two comparisons show
that information about the concreteness of both cue and
associate is important for predicting asymmetry, consistent
with Tversky‟s explanation of the link between features and
asymmetry.
It is also notable that FreqDisp is a
(marginally) significant predictor in only one of the three
models. Therefore the predictive relationship between
concreteness and asymmetry (illustrated in Fig. 2) does not
derive from discrepancies in frequency between words.

Conclusion
In this study we have reported the following effects of
increasing conceptual concreteness:
1. Fewer, but stronger associates (Analysis 1).
2. A stronger correlation between the similarity of
concepts and the strength of their association (Analysis 2).
3. Greater asymmetry of association (Analysis 3).

These findings derive from analyses of thousands of
concepts and data from thousands of subjects, an approach
that significantly increases their robustness in comparison
with previous behavioral experiments.
Finding 3 is consistent with, and arguably suggestive of,
the view that concrete representations are more strongly
feature-based than abstract concepts. Instead of a strongly
feature-based structure, abstract representations encode
patterns of relations with other concepts (both abstract and
concrete). We hypothesize that the degree of feature-based
structure is the fundamental cognitive correlate of what is
intuitively understood as concreteness.
On this account, computing the similarity of two concrete
concepts would involve a (asymmetric) feature comparison
of the sort described by Tversky. In contrast, computing the
similarity of abstract concepts would require a (more
symmetric) comparison of relational predicates such as
analogy or structure-mapping (Markman & Gentner, 1993).
Because of their representational structure, the feature-based
operation would be simple and intuitive for concrete
concepts, so that similar objects (of close taxonomic
categories) come to be associated. On the other hand, for
abstract concepts, perhaps because structure mapping is
more complex or demanding, the items that come to be
associated are instead those that fill neighboring positions in

In a separate analysis, we observed that the ConcProd
model over pairs in which the cue word is a noun (R2 =
0.1325) fits better than the model over pairs in which the
cue is a non-noun (R2 = 0.0987) or specifically a verb (R2 =
0.114). Indeed, across all 18,668 pairs, the mean additive
asymmetry when both cue and associate are nouns (.071) is

583

the relational structure specified by that concept (such as
arguments of verbs or prepositions). Intuitively this would
result in a larger set of associates than for concrete concepts,
as confirmed by Finding 1. Moreover, such associates
would not in general be similar, as supported by Finding 2.
If this is correct, it is likely that computational models of
meaning could be improved by integrating a dimension of
concreteness. For instance, models that connect words via
syntagmatic co-occurrence would be particularly
appropriate for modeling human association in abstract
domains, whereas approaches based on taxonomies, or those
measuring paradigmactic co-occurrence, would better
reflect similarity and be more apt for concrete domains. In
future work we plan to test these hypotheses by analyzing
how concreteness is reflected in running text corpora.
