     However, one can also think of situations where an
addressee may reason that the redundant information is
somehow relevant, even when the speaker did not intend it
in this way (Grice would call this a false conversational

therefore is that if an object is described redundantly as
“large” or “small” this will influence how the size of this           Figure 1: Example scene consisting of two same size chairs,

    In addition to the size question, participants were also
asked to indicate the color of each object referred to on a
one-dimensional saturation scale, ranging from lighter to
darker, again with the handle initially positioned in the
middle, on the assumption that a redundant mention of color
(like “red”) would cause participants to perceive an object
as “redder” than when color was not mentioned in a
description. However, no reliable effects of redundant color
adjectives were found, and we will not describe the results
of this measure further. In the general discussion we do
