.25. As seen in Figure 3, this interaction appears to be
driven by the difference in the effects of intention between
the baseline and test conditions, with a much larger increase
in α occurring in the frequency intention than the amplitude
intention. The α values for both intention conditions during
the baseline trials were closest to the region associated with
pink noise (S ≈ -1, α ≈ 1). The α values for those intending
to control amplitude during the test condition were
characteristic of white noise (S ≈ 0, α ≈ 0), while those for
participants asked to control movement frequency were
closer to the region associated with anti-persistent,
dependent behavior (S ≈ 1, α ≈ -1).
  Given evidence that the effects of intention condition
were most apparent during the test trials for both
coordination strength and scaling relation, we chose to
conduct a regression to determine whether circular variance
could account for variation in scaling relation above and
beyond that accounted for by intentional condition. A
forward regression indicated that intention explained a
significant proportion of variation in scaling relation, R2 =
.42, F (1, 15) = 10.86, p = .005, and was significantly
predictive of scaling relation, b = .65, t (15) = 3.30, p =
.005, for the test trials. However, the predictive contribution
of circular variance was not significant, as it only accounted
for an additional 2.8% of the variance in scaling relation
above and beyond that accounted for by intention.
