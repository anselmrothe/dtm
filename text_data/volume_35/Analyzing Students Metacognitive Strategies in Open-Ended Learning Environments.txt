                       Betty's Brain
   Betty's Brain (Figure 1) is an open-ended learning envi-
ronment (Land, 2000) that provides students with a learning
context and a set of tools for pursuing authentic and com-
plex learning tasks. Students teach a virtual agent, Betty,
about science topics by constructing a causal map. The goal
for students using Betty's Brain is to teach Betty a map,
whose correctness is determined in relation to a hidden, ex-
pert causal map.                                                             Figure 1: Betty's Brain Interface with Quiz Window

   Learning was assessed using a pre-post test design. Each
written test consisted of five questions that asked students to
consider a given scenario and explain its causal impact on
climate change. Scoring was based on the causal relations
that students used to explain their answers to the questions,
which were then compared to the chain of causal relations
used to derive the answer from the expert map. One point
was awarded for each causal relationship in the student's an-
swer that came from or was closely related to an expert
causal link. The maximum combined score for the five
questions was 16. Two coders independently scored a subset
of the pre- and post-tests with at least 85% agreement, at
which point the coders split the remaining tests and individ-
ually coded the answers and computed the scores.                       Figure 2: Pre-post Test Results (mean (std dev)) and Final
