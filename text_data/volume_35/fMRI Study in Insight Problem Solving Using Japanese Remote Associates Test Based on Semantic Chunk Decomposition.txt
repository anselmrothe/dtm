Chunked > Non-chunked (failed trials)
   In the failed trials, this contrast examined the brain areas
that were more activated during searching for a target in the
chunked condition when compared with those in the non-
chunked condition. Several peaks of activation were found,
including the right and left cingulate gyri (right BA 24, left
BA 24, left BA 32), the left medial frontal gyrus (left BA 32,
left BA 11, left BA 6), and the left paracentral lobule (left BA
31) (Table 1). Figure 5 depicts these areas of activation.
Chunked > Non-chunked (correct trials)
   In the correct trials, this contrast examined the brain areas
that were more activated until a target was found in the chun-
ked condition when compared with those in the non-chunked
condition. It was confirmed that the left posterior cingulate
(left BA 30) was activated (Table 2). Figure 6 depicts this
area of activation.
