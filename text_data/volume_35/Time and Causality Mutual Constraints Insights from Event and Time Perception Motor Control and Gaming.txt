asymmetries around the point of actual simultaneity were

profound influences on human time perception of visual and
voluntary motor events.
Causal choice in the face of environmental
complexity (Young)
   Prior research on causal judgment and choice has focused
on situations in which the events either lack temporal extent,
only one candidate cause and effect are being judged, or
events are presented as a series of discrete trials. All of
these approaches help to manage the complexity of the
interaction being judged, and evidence suggests that people
engage in forward inference under these simplified
conditions. I will discuss evidence from Video-game based
research that suggests that greater environmental
complexity appears to produce backward, rather than
forward, inference.
