Abstract
We studied decision making in situations in which there is a
monetary incentive to take risk, and in which the risk taking option sometimes involves deception. We conducted a
within participant experiment in which we compared risk taking in deception conditions to pure (non-deceptive) gambles
with equivalent risks and outcomes. We confirmed the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes in both conditions. We found that
participants chose fewer risky options when the risky option
was associated with deception, but that those who deceived
more in the deception condition also took more risks in the
gamble condition. We conclude that people who tend to take
risks in gambles, also take them when it involves deception,
although to a lesser extent.
Keywords: Decision making; risk attitudes; deception; incentives.

Introduction
Despite being a fundamental construct in many economic theories, individual risk attitude does not exhibit the construct
stability generally associated with personality traits. Many
studies (e.g. Berg, Dickhaut, & McCabe, 2005; Holt & Laury,
2002; Isaac & James, 2000) have shown that inconsistency in
people’s risk taking depends for instance on the nature (hypothetical vs. real) and magnitude of outcomes, the task and
the situation they are facing (e.g., lottery vs. auction vs. game
show), and the risk elicitation method (e.g., questionnaires vs.
laboratory experiments).
Just as people are willing to take risk in certain situations
and not in others, there are also situations in which people are
willing to deceive and others in which they are not. We studied the interplay of these two tendencies in situations where
deception was risky but the decision maker could choose not
to deceive and not to take risk. In these situations there was,
by design, no trade-off between risk-taking and deception.
Sakamoto, Laine, and Farber (forthcoming) found that perceived detection risk is one of the factors that determines
whether people decide to deceive or not, and that it is evaluated differently in gain- and loss-facing situations. In the current study we sought to find out whether people’s decisions to
deceive are driven by their attitudes towards dishonest behavior or towards risk taking, and whether their non-deceptive
risky choices can predict their decisions to deceive. Particularly, we were interested in if people’s risk taking behavior
in the deceptive domain also follows the four-fold pattern of
risk attitudes (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992), namely that on
average people are risk averse when facing high probability
gains and low probability losses (e.g., buying insurance) and

risk seeking when facing low probability gains (e.g., buying
a lottery ticket) and high probability losses.
In the extensive decision making literature, few studies have addressed the four-fold pattern directly (Harbaugh,
Krause, & Vesterlund, 2009). Those that have, have not found
convincing evidence in support of the pattern, supposedly
due to methodological issues related to e.g. the elicitation
method, usage of complicated or hypothetical prospects, or
presence of low and high probability prospects in the gain
domain only.
Often the number of participants and the number of decisions per participant have also been relatively small. In order
to test the four-fold pattern of risk attitudes we designed a
within participant study, and collected data from substantial
number of individuals. We compared risk-taking decisions
in two hypothetical situations, one of which was an abstract
gamble and the other a real-life decision situation presumably familiar to many of our participants, namely filing a tax
return. Using several analysis and modeling techniques we
found support for the four-fold pattern of risk attitudes, as
well as differences in risk-seeking vs. risk-avoiding behaviors in these two conditions. Despite differences in risk taking
between participants who decided to deceive and those who
did not, we found consistency in individual decisions across
the two conditions.

Risk attitudes when facing gain vs. loss
An abundance of empirical evidence has shown that people
weight losses and gains asymmetrically, so that a loss is generally considered worse than an equivalent gain (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979). This gain versus loss trade-off has been
termed loss aversion. The principle of loss aversion is controversial since, as Gal (2006) points out, it is used in an
ad hoc manner to explain a number of phenomena involving losses and gains, such as the sunk-cost effect, the endowment effect and status-quo bias (Harinck, Dijk, Beest,
& Mersmann, 2007); while at the same time, these phenomena have been presented as evidence for the existence of loss
aversion. Tversky and Kahneman (1991) notwithstanding, it
remains unclear how strong the experimental evidence is for
loss aversion (Bateman, Kahneman, Munro, Starmer, & Sugden, 2005; Novemsky & Kahneman, 2005).
In general people prefer avoiding losses to making gains,
and when facing gains they exhibit risk aversion, which is
considered a fundamental element in theories of human decision making under risk (Holt & Laury, 2002). Its true nature

2808

is not well understood, for instance how its existence depends
on the size of the risky outcomes (Holt & Laury, 2002), as
laboratory experiments usually use relatively low monetary
incentives. The observed pattern of human risky behavior is
more complex than briefly described above, and it relates not
only to the magnitudes of gains and losses but also to their
probabilities.
Markowitz (1952) proposed a value function, defined over
gains and losses, that underweights small gains and small
losses relative to large gains and large losses. This implies
risk-seeking behavior for small gains and risk-avoiding behavior for large gains, whereas the reverse is true for losses
(Haisley, Mostafa, & Loewenstein, 2008). Kahneman and
Tversky (1979) explain the equivalent risk preference pattern
— dubbed the four-fold pattern of risk attitudes — with a
probability weighting function that overweights low probabilities and underweights moderate and high probabilities.

Lie aversion
We are interested in whether and how the risk preference
changes when risk is associated with deceptive behavior that
results in a better outcome than risk-avoiding behavior. Pure
lie aversion would mean that the cost of lying is derived
from the act of lying only. Even if there is evidence that lie
aversion exists, it is not always pure, but is relative to the
circumstances or linked to the consequences of lying (especially in repeated interactions where reputation is at stake) or
beliefs about the outcomes and expectations of others (Erat
& Gneezy, 2012; Gneezy, 2005; Hurkens & Kartik, 2009;
López-Pérez & Spiegelman, in press; Lundquist, Ellingsen,
Gribbe, & Johannesson, 2009).
López-Pérez and Spiegelman (in press) devise an experiment to isolate pure lie aversion. To rule out altruistic or
guilt-avoidance motivations for truth-telling, none of their
treatments induced loss for the receiver, but instead involved
a slight increase in the sender’s payoff if she decided to lie.
Even if the majority of the participants lied, the number of
participants (about one third) who never did was the same in
each treatment. This led the authors to conclude that pure lie
aversion does exist. Lundquist, Ellingsen, and Johannesson
(2009) also find evidence for lie aversion, with the effect increasing with the size of the lie (people prefer not to stretch
the truth too much), and with free communication as opposed
to predefined messages.
Erat and Gneezy (2012) as well find strong evidence for lie
aversion, but also convincing evidence that people are willing to lie, even at their own cost, if it significantly helps the
other person, and even more so if their own payoff increases
without increasing the other person’s costs. Gneezy (2005)
also finds that people tend to lie if there is no cost associated
with lying itself, and if the lying benefits themselves without
hurting others.
Hurkens and Kartvik (2009) argue that people can be categorized roughly into two kinds: to those who would never
lie and to those who will always lie if the benefit from lying

exceeds the benefit from telling the truth. Gibson, Tanner and
Wagner’s results (2012) reject this static type-based model,
but they argue that significant within and among individual
heterogeneity exists in lie aversion and willingness to engage
in deceptive behavior, providing evidence that intrinsic preferences are non-separable form economic incentives. In summary, people are sensitive to the outcomes attainable by lying, and aversion to lying cannot be explained solely by the
negative (guilt) feeling from the act of lying itself, but rather
must take some account of what can be achieved (benefits) or
avoided (costs) by lying.

Experiment
We designed an experiment to study how incentives, i.e, monetary gain vs. no-gain and monetary loss vs. no-loss, and the
associated risks affect people’s propensity to choose a deceptive risky option, in conditions where the risky option is associated with a better outcome (if successful) than the sure option. We compared risky choices in the deception condition to
the pure gamble condition in which there was no deception.
As the deception condition we chose a real-life scenario of
filling in an annual income tax return. The risk in these scenarios was defined as the probability that the tax return would
be audited and the information found to be in error.
Mainly supportive but also mixed evidence exists about
the effectiveness of audit probability and fines as a deterrent
for tax evasion. Maciejovsky, Schwarzenberger, and Kirchler (2012) review several studies that found a positive effect
of audit probability on tax compliance, and also studies that
failed to find any support for tax fines as effective deterrents
for tax evasion. The authors suggest affect as a determinant of
tax behavior, but other sources have also been suggested, such
as trust, fairness, and social norms (Maciejovsky et al., 2012).
We are not aware of any studies that have linked deception
aversion to tax behavior or that have focused primarily on
willingness to deceive in taxes across conditions of variable
risk and outcome size.

Method
Participants Using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk,
http://www.mturk.com/) we recruited 690 participants to
complete an online questionnaire in Qualtrics software
(http://www.qualtrics.com). After discarding data from participants who failed the attention check question we had 672
participants (362 women, 308 men, 2 unknown; median age
29 years, age range: 18-73 years). All participants were native English speakers, aged 18 or above, and residing in the
US. Each participant received USD 1.00 for their participation.
Material We prepared 18 questions in two conditions that
asked for choices between a sure and a risky option. The
difference between the conditions was that one of them used
simple monetary gambles, whereas the other used real-life
scenarios of filling the tax return (deception scenario). In
the deception condition risky outcome was always associated

2809

with the deceptive option, and the sure outcome with the honest option. We chose this design because of the inherent risky
nature of deception: there is always a chance, however minimal, that the deception is detected, leading to an adverse outcome. In other words, examples in which risk taking is associated with a sure outcome would have been, in our opinion,
so artificial — especially the cases with sure losses — that we
expected them to bias our participants’ decision behavior.
We chose the tax return as our deception scenario since it
has the extremely valuable feature of being usable symmetrically for the gain and loss domains, depending on whether
the taxpayer is facing additional taxes or a tax refund.1
Four types of scenarios were prepared in both conditions:
high probability gain, high probability loss, low probability
gain, and low probability loss, so that for each outcome level
(gain and loss) we created both a low probability and a high
probability scenario. These types were designed to test the
four-fold pattern of risk attitudes, and the value of the sure
option was chosen to match the expected value of the risky
option. For each type we created four outcome and probability variations, as shown in Table 1.2

Deception scenario John is doing his yearly taxes. He has to
answer a question about how many dependents he has. John
is aware that only children under 19 years of age qualify as
dependents for tax purposes; his son recently turned 19, and
so does not qualify. If he tells the truth, indicating he has zero
dependents, he will get back $950. Alternatively he could
say he has one dependent, in which case he would instead
get back $1000. He knows that such mistakes are fairly common, and that he can relatively easily find an excuse for his
“clerical error” if his tax return is audited. If in the audit his
answer is found to be in error, however, he would get back
$0. He also knows that 5% of such errors are caught. If you
were John, would you say
[] You have zero dependents and get back $950 for sure.
[] You have one dependent, in which case you have a 95%
chance of getting back $1000, but also a 5% chance of getting
back $0.
Gamble scenario Imagine that you face the following two
alternatives and you must choose one of them. Which one
would you choose?
[] Win $950 for sure.
[] 95% chance to win $1000, $0 otherwise.

Example scenarios in the gain condition are shown in Figure 1. The wording in the corresponding loss scenarios was
“have to pay”, instead of “get back” (deception), and “lose”
instead of “win” (gamble). The choice options were presented horizontally next to each other, and their order was
randomized.
Procedure After giving their informed consent the participants were asked to make their choices in 18 deception scenarios and 18 gamble scenarios (the order of sets was selected
randomly for each participant). All participants answered all
36 questions, so the deception vs. gamble manipulation was
within participant. After finishing the choice questionnaire
they filled in optional background information, such as age,
gender, and education. The questionnaire ended with a debriefing. It took them about 20 minutes to finish the whole
experiment.
1 We acknowledge that using lying in one’s taxes as the deception domain may have resulted in effects that we were unable to
control. The reason we saw much less risk taking in deception scenarios may be that some participants did not base their decisions on
the outcomes and associated probabilities, or moral considerations
of deceiving in general, but were driven by a specific aversion to
lying in their taxes or to the government.
2 We also designed two additional questions with a medium probability of 55% and outcome of (-)$1000, but they were excluded
from the analysis for the purpose of this paper, since the focus here
is the four-fold pattern of risk attitudes.

Results
We started by plotting the relative frequencies of risk takers
in gains and losses for each question separately (Figure 2).
When facing losses, clearly far more participants took risks in
gamble scenarios than in deception scenarios across all probabilities of losing, and even more so for the higher probabilities. In gains, the risk taking varied with the amount to
be gained in both conditions, but more so for gambles in
which more participants took risk when facing small rather
than large gains with low probabilities, whereas not much difference was seen between scenarios with high probabilities.
First we wanted to ensure that the concepts of gain/loss
and gamble/deception really explain the variance in the
data. Even if the overall frequency of risk taking is only
28.4%, two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (2 scenario conditions × 2 outcome conditions) found significant main effects both for gamble (M=6.51)3 vs. deception (M=2.82),
F(1,671)=666.03, p<0.01, and for gain (M=3.19) vs. loss
(M=5.78), F(1,671)=651.43, p<0.01, as well as an interaction, F(1,672)=420.11, p<0.01. Pairwise t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment showed that all pairwise differences between
these four conditions (i.e., deception gain, M=1.19 (Risk taking score ∈ [0, 8]); deception loss, M=1.64; gamble gain,
M=2.00; and gamble loss, M=4.50) were significantly different, p<0.001.
Risk seeking and risk aversion To see if the data supports
the concepts of risk seeking and risk aversion, we applied factor analysis that uses a multidimensional item response model
3 For each participant we calculated a risk taking score (∈ [0, 16])
as the number of times they chose the risky option in 16 questions.

for binary data. We chose solutions with the smallest number
of factors that showed a meaningful structure: a one-factor
solution for deception and a two-factor solution for gambles.
The Promax rotated factor loadings are shown in Table 2.
For gambles the factor loadings clearly align with the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes, if we interpret the Factor 1 as
“risk seeking” and Factor 2 as “risk aversion.” Even though
not shown in Table 2, a two-factor solution for deception also
showed a similar pattern to the gamble data. It thus seems
that our participants were driven by the risk attitude in both
gamble and deception conditions.
However, as shown in Table 2, just one factor was enough
to explain all responses in the deception condition, whereas
no such meaningful pattern was detected in the gamble data.
It thus seems that in the gamble condition our participants
were driven by risk attitudes, but in the deception condition
these attitudes were joined by other considerations.
On another note, unlike what would be suggested by the
four-fold pattern of risk attitudes, the participants tended to
choose the sure option in more than half of the low probability gain questions (t(671)=18.30, p<0.01). More specifically,
their risk taking in this condition was heavily affected by the
value of the gamble, so that they were much more willing to
trade off a sure $4 for unsure $20 than a sure $500 for unsure $5000, so they gambled in the former case but chose
the sure option in the latter. This clearly contradicts what

one would expect from the four-fold pattern of risk attitudes,
which predicts risk-seeking in all of these cases. We hypothesize that this may be an effect of our participant population,
but more rigorous analysis of the difference the amount of
money makes in risky and deceptive choices is a subject for
future studies.
Risk aversion or deception aversion We have already established that the participants chose less risky options in
the deception condition than in the pure gambling condition.
However, the interesting question is whether their gambling
behavior and deception behavior are statistically related.
We initially run χ2 -analyses to find out if our participants’
risk taking in the gamble scenarios and in the corresponding
deception scenarios were correlated. For all questions the responses in these two conditions were not independent; the
results were very or extremely significant for all questions
except high probability loss with risky outcome of $20 (for
which it was still significant).
We also conducted another factor analysis for the whole
dataset, i.e. gamble and deception responses combined. For
the same reason as before, we chose a four-factor model. The
Promax rotated factor loadings are shown in Table 3. For each
question we chose the factor on which it loaded the strongest.
We see Factor 1 appearing as a “deception aversion” factor,
and Factor 3 as “risk aversion.” Compared to the two-factor
solution for gambles, in this solution the “risk seeking” factor
is split into two, Factors 2 and 4. Also some questions in deception condition, which are expected to load the strongest on
“deception aversion” load strongly on “risk aversion” factor.
We then considered the determinants of deceptive behav-

the gamble condition. The relative risk taking frequencies of
non-deceptive and deceptive participants in the gamble questions are plotted in Figure 3 for gains and losses. Compared
to the participants who never deceived, the participants who
chose at least one risky option in the deception condition also
more often chose a risky option in all gamble conditions.

ior by correlating factor scores of Factor 2 in the gamble data
(which we interpreted as “pure” risk aversion) to the factor
scores of the four factors in the combined data. The correlations are 0.46 (p<0.01), 0.04 (p = n.s.), 0.75 (p<0.01),
and -0.11 (p<0.01) for combined factors 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Note that the correlation to the combined Factor
1 is relatively high even though most questions highly associated with that factor are not highly associated with Factor 2
in gambles.
The factor pattern, together with the correlation of factor
scores, suggests that deception aversion does not fully explain
the reluctance to choose the risky option in the deception scenarios, but rather that something profound in the risk attitudes
also plays a role.
As many as 279 (out of 672) participants never chose the

To quantify the statistical significance of this observation,
we conducted a mixed 2 (never deceived vs. sometimes deceived) × 4 (four-fold pattern) ANOVA that showed a significant main effect of those who never deceived (M=5.735)
(Score ∈ [0,16]) vs. those who deceived at least once
(M=7.056), F(1,672)=36.83, p<0.001. Non-deceiving participants also appeared to be risk averse in gambles.
The factor structure for non-deceiving participants’ gamble
responses follows the structure for the rest of the participants,
shown in Table 2. As the above ANOVA shows, they took
significantly fewer risks overall, and more specifically they
chose significantly fewer risky options in low probability gain
questions (M=1.072) (Score ∈ [0,4]), compared to the others
(M=1.310), F(1,614)=7.6308 (p<0.01). There is something
particular in these participants and their responses, which is
also reflected in the factor solution (see Table 3): the low
probability gain questions are explained by their own factor,
separate from the other supposedly risk seeking questions.

Zooming down to the individual question level, a 1-sided
proportion test showed a very significant reduction in risk
taking for this participant group in all high probability gain
questions (p<0.001), and also a significant reduction in all
low probability loss questions (p<0.01). High probability
loss and low probability gain groups both contained questions
for which the test results were not significant. None of the
questions in these groups showed statistically very significant
(p<0.01) results.
In summary, honest participants chose less risky options in
the gamble conditions in which one would expect risk aversion. Compared to the rest of the participants, the honest participants were more risk averse overall, and especially so in
conditions in which one would expect risk avoidance.

Discussion
Our central finding is that the participants who always chose
the honest option in deception scenarios also displayed a distinctive pattern of behavior in non-deceptive gamble scenarios. They took fewer risks than normal in conditions that normally elicit risky responses, and were also more risk averse
than other participants in conditions that normally elicit risk
aversion. From this we conclude that it may not be pure
lie aversion that determines the likelihood of risky deceptive
behavior even in seemingly perfectly lie-averse people, but
rather that risk attitude also plays a role. In other words, these
”honest” participants may still be driven in part by an unusually strong aversion to risk, rather than purely by aversion
to deception itself. Our results also support a (less surprising)
generalization about risk-takers, namely that people who tend
to take risks under normal conditions also tend to take them
in deception context. Together, these results can be summed
up as indicating that there is some within participant consistency in risk taking across conditions that do or do not involve
deception. In other words, deception aversion cannot be regarded as a ”pure” factor, and does not totally overrun risk
seeking in the deception domain. However, the nature of our
experimental design does not allow a fully conclusive distinction between these two forces. Future studies are planned to
address this issue.
