physical simulator and assigns belief to two decisions: 1) is
there sufficient certainty about which target the ball will hit
to offer any guess at all? (analogous to participants’ decision
whether or not to press any button at all), and if so, 2) which
target should be guessed?
   The decision of whether any prediction should be made is
based on the proportion of simulation paths that reached
either target. These are combined and fit with two
parameters: a parameter α representing a Luce choice soft-
max weighting, and a parameter γ to capture a bias towards
making any guess at all:
                            !"# !"#  !"  !"##$ ! !!
(2)    ! !"# =
                   !"# !"#  !"  !"##$ ! !!"# !"!"#$%&' ! !!
   Conditioned on the decision to make any guess at all, the
decision whether to guess red or green is based on the
relative proportion of simulated paths that reached each
color target. Here, there is a single Luce choice soft-max
weighting parameter (β), but because experimental trial
colors were randomized, we assumed no bias:
                                    !"# !"# !
(3)       ! !"# !"# =
                            !"# !"# ! !!"# !"##$ !
   Finally, we assume there is a decision offset: people
cannot immediately use simulation information, but instead
must take time to process it, come to a decision, and move
their hand to push a button. Thus we fit a single parameter t
to determine how long the model should wait to use
simulation information.6
   These four parameters were optimized to fit the empirical
data at each polling time point for each trial. At each point,
we created a vector of the empirical probabilities of pressing
each of the two keys at time point i of trial j: [prop(Red)ij,
prop(Green)ij]. We then calculated a similar vector of model              Figure 2: Joint histogram of model (x-axis) and human (y-
