                   Andreas Roepstorff
An emerging body of research demonstrates how people, in
direct interaction, become coupled along a number of
dimensions: e.g., physiology, behavior, and semantics.
However, once these methods are applied to more complex,
goal-oriented settings, it seems that the patterns of
coordination are not only synchrony and mimicry, but also
more complex forms of complementarity such as in division
of labor. This raises the issue of whether the same
mechanisms may explain the simple and the more complex
forms of coordination? I will explore the hypothesis that in a
