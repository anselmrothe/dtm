    Factor 1 leads mainly to allocations for high ranking
friends and first degree friends. To define, these friends can
be interpreted as close friends, so we named this factor
“close friends.” Factor 2 can be considered as the “unknown
others” factor, because it strongly influences the allocation
to friends who have more than one degree of separation.
Logically, one cannot directly know friends who are of
                                                                        Social ranking
more than the second order, and specifically, friends who
have more than two degrees of separation are actually
unknown because they are not even the friend of a first
order friend. Factor 3 mainly impacts friends with rankings
higher than 10th, and in particular those who are ranked at
20th place or higher. These friends are considered as not
being so close. Thus, we named this factor as the
“acquaintances” factor.
   The above results suggest that there are several
dimensions to social discounting. Specifically, it is                                                                                                                    Degree of separation
