Results and Discussion

subjects) mixed model ANOVA. As expected, there was a

1027.74, p < .0001, η²p = .74. In line with previous studies,
overall only 20% (SE = 2.2%) of participants managed to
solve the standard bat-and-ball problem correctly. However,
the control version that did not give rise to substitution was
solved correctly by 99% (SE = .5%) of the participants.
Accuracy did not differ in the two age groups; the Age
Group and Age Group x Problem Version interaction did
not reach significance, both Fs < 1.
     Note that incorrect responses on the standard version
were almost exclusively (i.e., 361 out of 363 responses) of
the “10 cents” type suggesting that biased participants were
not simply making a random guess but indeed engaged in
the postulated substitution process 2.
Confidence ratings. Our crucial question concerned
participants’ response confidence. A first analysis focused
on the response confidence of reasoners who substituted and
gave the erroneous “10 cents” response on the standard
version. These participants’ confidence ratings were entered
in a 2 (problem version, within-subjects) x 2 (age group,
between subjects) mixed model ANOVA. Results showed
