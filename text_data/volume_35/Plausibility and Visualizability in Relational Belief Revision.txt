account the counterfact. Two alternative revised models,
both variations of the initial model, taking into account the
fact while preserving as much of the initial information as
possible, were presented on the screen. The two revised
models were presented on the left and the right side of the
computer monitor. The task was to choose among the
models the one which matched the participant´s assumption
about the revised object relations. Choices were indicated by
left and right button presses. One of the revised models was
plausible; the other one was implausible. The question was
whether reasoners still apply the LO-principle or whether
they prefer revisions based on the plausibility. The two
alternative revised models for the example above were:
   (1)    Cucumber Pumpkin Asparagus
   (2)    Asparagus Cucumber Pumpkin
Note that model (1) results from the relocation of the LO of
the fact (which is the cucumber) but leads to an implausible
order of objects. Model (2), in contrast, results from the
relocation of the RO of the fact (which is the pumpkin) but
leads to a plausible order of the objects. Over the entire set
