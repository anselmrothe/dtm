trials. X-axes indicate the step to be performed, by step ordinal number. Interruptions occur for the interruption trial type
between steps four and five and nine and ten in this example. Consequently the goal buffer chunk lacks task context
representation in these two spots, indicated by dashes. The chunk encoding the main goal of the task is Do a Trial (DAT) and
it is associated to subsequently performing the first step. Do a Trial, as well as each step’s representation, acts as context to
cue retrieval of the next step. Do a Trial’s activation is depicted in panel c. Arrows indicate times at which Do a Trial receives
activation boosts because the model retrieves it at the end of each subgoal. The model’s behavior with regard to Do a Trial is
the same in both control and interruption conditions. The model’s internal context representations, encoded in the chunks
referenced from the slots of the goal and imaginal buffer chunks, are depicted at each step of the task beneath panels a and b.
These are the procedure step representations the model had retrieved when performing previous steps. To conserve space task
steps are indicated by procedure sequence order, so the first step of the task is 1 and so on.
