it is easier on the production system (e.g., Bard et al., 2007;
Bock, 1986). This can result in utterances that initially
appear to be egocentric. However, once an interlocutor
realizes that her ambiguity might reduce the success of the
interaction, she almost immediately adapts her utterances to
eliminate the type of ambiguity that was confusing for her
listener (Roche, Dale, Jaeger & Kreuz, under revision).
   Despite these efforts, the focus of the existing literature          Figure 3: Sample of the animal figure instruction cards
