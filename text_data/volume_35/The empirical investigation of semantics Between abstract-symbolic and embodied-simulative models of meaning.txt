(2) One prediction of Emulative Semantics is that the
understanding of linguistic contexts about emotional
scenarios should involve the emulation of emotions. Since
the emulation of emotions is also thought to be a basis for
the human capacity of empathy, Emulative Semantics
predicts a correlation between empathy with emotions and
the comprehension of linguistic emotion contexts. In a
recent ERP study we could in fact show that, in linguistic
emotion contexts, the N400 effect, which indicates
violations of semantic expectations, depends on empathy as
measured by the Multifaceted Empathy Test.
Rolf A. Zwaan
Language comprehension involves the construction of
mental representations. This seems an uncontroversial
statement in most of cognitive science. Much research has
focused on the nature of these representations: are they text-
based or situational (or both) are they abstract or grounded
in perception and action? My goal here is to propose and
