Abstract
Metacognition plays a fundamental role in forming selfjudgments of ability and knowledge. Is metacognition
domain and gender specific? Metacognitive judgments and
performance were measured across biology, literature, and
math content. Undergraduates took three shortened SAT II
Subject Tests, and provided estimates of their performance
both before and after taking each test. The results were that
judgments
differed
across
domain
and
gender.
Overconfidence was evident in all domains, although
estimates of ability were more accurate after taking a test.
Males tended to be more overconfident, while females were
less confident yet more accurately calibrated when estimating
ability. Students were over-confident in math, bringing into
question the existence of math phobia. Improvement in
calibration and gender difference in calibration were most
noticeable in math.
Keywords: metacognition, math anxiety, gender differences,
mathematics education.

Introduction
Metacognition, a form of higher-order thinking, plays an
important role in cognitive processing. It impacts several
areas within cognitive science, such as attention, memory,
perception, comprehension, and problem solving
(Kitchener, 1983; Metcalfe & Shimamura, 1994).
Metacognition aids intellectual endeavors requiring complex
thought processes (Schoenfeld, 1983) and also affects social
behavior (Jaccard, Dodge & Guilamo-Ramos, 2005) and
decision making (Cohen, Freeman, & Thompson, 1998).
Two components of metacognition are of particular
importance in education: the ability to monitor what you
know, which acts as a basis for predicting retention, and the
control processes that are used to enact study activities
(Nelson & Dunlosky, 1991).
Students need to use
metacognitive control in gauging what they know and
deciding what study methods to use (Thiede, Anderson, &
Therriault, 2003; Metcalfe, 2009).
This process is
constantly changing, as students adapt their behaviors in
monitoring a learning goal. Self-regulation is necessary for
this process (Kornell & Bjork, 2007), thus students must
select from a variety of strategies, enacting these strategies
in goal-directed activities, and monitoring their progress in
using these strategies.
Success of metacognition affects students’ academic
performance (Hattie, Biggs, & Purdie, 1996; Paris & Paris,
2001, Coutinho, 2008), as well as their ability to
communicate what they know about a particular problem.
Being able to communicate their level of understanding to
instructors is crucial to the learning process. It guides how
classroom and self-study materials are constructed, and can

affect what strategies students are taught for study and
examination.
Metacognition has been shown to play a crucial role in
gauging one’s own knowledge (Sperling, Howard, Stanley
& DuBois, 2004; Schunk & Ertmer, 2000), including
specific academic domains such as reading comprehension
(Pressley, 2002), math (Pugalee, 2001), science (Schraw,
Crippen, & Hartley, 2006), and writing (Pugalee, 2001).
Any improvements in metacognition would allow students
to better judge what they know and how well they will be
able to recall information. This holds much promise for
improving student academic performance.
Despite the importance of metacognition, people
commonly display glaring overconfidence in their selfperception of their own knowledge and various abilities
(Kruger & Dunning, 1999; Dunning, Johnson, Ehrlinger, &
Kruger, 2003). Furthermore, people with lower abilities
show an even more exaggerated overconfidence. Students
in particular often self-report confidence judgments that are
unrelated to their actual performance on assessments
(Schraw, 1996). Compounding this is students’ inability to
allocate study times effectively. Methods of self-guided
study often result in non-optimal allocation of study time
(Son & Sethi, 2010). Improved methods are available, but
students generally do not employ them, even though it has
been shown that it is possible to use metacognitive control.
There is potential for optimal study (Son & Sethi, 2006), but
students instead use uninformed metacognitive decisions to
structure their study time.
A possible exception to the overconfidence phenomenon
is the occurrence of math anxiety (Meece, Wigfield, &
Eccles, 1990; Furner & Berman, 2003). Math anxiety (or
math phobia) is a fear of math that leads to math avoidance
or lower math performance (Ashcraft, 2002; Ashcraft &
Krause, 2007) and has been observed in children and adults
alike (Wigfield & Meece, 1988). This sometimes extreme
anxiety is harmful in educational and workplace settings
(Meece et al., 1990; Furner & Berman, 2003), undermining
national and worldwide priorities to emphasize science,
technology, engineering, and math (STEM) achievement.
Indeed, a recent national report predicts increased demand
for STEM professionals in the US as well as an inadequate
supply of prepared graduates (STEMconnector, 2013).
Performing math tasks in stressful situations, such as during
tests, only compounds math anxiety (Beilock, 2008). Mathphobic attitudes of teachers can also be detrimental to
students’ math achievement, particularly for female teachers
and students (Beilock, 2010).
This fear of math implies that there should be a
corresponding underconfidence in self-evaluation of

residual magnitudes show that participants were better able
to assess their ability after each test, providing evidence for
improvement in metacognitive judgment of ability (t = 3.30,
df = 60, p < 0.0001). The only test in which participants
showed slight underconfidence was biology.
Notably, participants showed high overconfidence in
math. The residual for average predicted math score was
35%. This was higher than the residuals for both biology
(2.6%) and literature (19%).

Similarly for
postdictions, females misestimated their performance by an
average of 5% while males misestimated by an average of
14%. Males were generally overconfident both before and
after taking each assessment. Overall, females had lower
measures of overconfidence. Within literature and math,
females began with overestimates of their ability, but their
postdictions were more calibrated. Within biology, females
actually started underconfident and became even more so
after taking this assessment.
Both genders show little trace of math phobia, as shown
by their predominant overestimates of performance.

The results of this study support past findings that people
are generally overconfident in their abilities, although
overconfidence does not appear to be exactly the same
across domains. This was shown in the varying judgments
of ability across academic domains. While both males and
females are generally overconfident, females tend to be
better calibrated in judging their domain knowledge.

higher scores are associated with lower residuals. These
findings support the previous work by Kruger & Dunning
(1999), Dunning et al. (2003) and Schraw (1996) and show
that people with low test scores generally exhibit
overconfidence, while people with high test scores are better
able to judge their ability. Thus higher performing students
tend to be better judges of their ability than are lower
performers.
Gender differences were most striking within math.
Figure 6 and 7 show calibration models by gender for both
predictions and postdictions. Males made predictions with
almost no calibration (r = 0.02), and females were
overconfident overall with the predictions. Despite this,
both genders were able to make much more accurate
postdictions. In fact, these postdiction models were the best
of any of the observed estimates of ability in this experiment

other subject tests. In fact, it had the lowest difficulty level.
During pilot experiments, test questions were chosen using
difficulty ratings provided by College Board. Although we
originally chose a variety of easy, medium, and difficult
questions for each subject test, performance on this balanced
math test was so poor that we substituted easier questions in
place of all medium and difficult questions. Thus, the
severe overconfidence observed in math is not a result of
higher test difficulty level compared to other academic
subjects.
Figures 4 and 5 show calibration slopes by domain. The
dashed line represents the equation y = x (predicted score =
actual score) is used to convey perfect calibration. The
closer a line is to this dashed line, the better the calibration.
For the predicted scores, there are apparent subject
differences, e.g., the slope is highest for math, indicating the
highest level of sensitivity to actual performance, and the
slope is actually slightly negative for biology. Each domain
slope more closely follows the calibration line y = x for
postdicted scores, showing that that participants were better
able to judge their ability after taking each assessment.
Each of models also crosses y = x, switching from
overconfidence to underconfidence as test performance
increases. In addition, correlations between actual scores
and residuals calculated from estimated scores (r = –0.63
for both predicted and postdicted residuals) reveal that
