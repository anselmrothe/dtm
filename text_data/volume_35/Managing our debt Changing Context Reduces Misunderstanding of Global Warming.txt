are naturally assessed – that is via some routinely used
cognitive procedure (similarity, fluency, availability, etc.).
The visual availability of the accumulation trajectory in the
climate task (i.e., the functional form of the line in the top
graph of Figure 1) may well contribute to it being readily
‘substituted’ for the correct attribute.
  This visual similarity cannot, however, be the only trigger
to adoption of the correlation heuristic because, as noted
earlier, its use has been observed in other contexts and in
non-graphical tasks (although the majority of studies have
used some kind of graphical representation, e.g., Cronin et
al., 2009). Thus a more likely candidate for the prevalence
of such heuristic responding is simply that stock-flow tasks
are not the kinds of things that we think about regularly,
thus we find them difficult, and readily revert to simpler
solutions. While we may be able to run a bath – thus
exhibiting behavior consistent with understanding the
principle of accumulation – it does not necessitate an
abstract appreciation of such knowledge.
  Furthermore our experience with such systems does not
typically involve making sequences of decisions about the
rates of change of in-flows and out-flows across time.
Rather they involve a single decision within a particular
time period. For example, when running a bath we know                       Figure 2: The Financial Task: A participant’s

                        Experiment
Participants
   Seventy-five undergraduate students from the University
of New South Wales took part in the study in return for
course credit. There were 44 females and the mean age was
19.92 (SD = 3.40). Each condition was run sequentially over
a 4 month period, so participants were not randomly
allocated to conditions. No participant completed more than
one condition.
Experimental Design and Procedure
  Participants were given one of three versions of the basic
stock-flow tasks described in the introduction (see Figures 1
and 2). For the Climate Task the graphs were adapted from
ones used by Dutt and Gonzalez (2012). In each condition
