Stimuli and Procedure Eighty short descriptions of life
events, many of which had previously been used in the
study of unrealistic optimism (e.g., Sharot et al., 2011;
Weinstein, 1980), were presented in a random order. Half of
the events were positive and half negative. Very rare or very
common events were avoided and all known probabilities
lay between 10% and 70% (M = 32.6, SD = 18.8; Office for
National Statistics and PubMed). The procedure followed
that of Sharot et al. (2011) (see Figure 1), with one addition.
Following their IE, participants were asked to estimate the
chance of the event occurring to the average person2.
Following the main task, participants’ memory for the base
rates presented to them was tested, and they provided four
salience ratings for each event3. Finally, a funneled debrief
