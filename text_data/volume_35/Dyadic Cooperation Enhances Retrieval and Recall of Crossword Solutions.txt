Conversation Analysis
In order to further quantify the effects of collaboration on
performance, conversations during the collaborative
sessions were recorded. A coarse analysis of these
recordings allowed us to collect information on the total
amount of time each dyad spent in the collaborative
sessions, as well as the amount of this time that was spent
talking. On average, dyads spent 241.13 seconds (SD =
71.37) in the (summed) collaborative rounds, and used, on
average, 109.29 of these seconds (SD = 34.72) conversing.
Because the amount of time spent in the collaborative part
of the task varied between dyads, a measure of percent
talking was also calculated for each dyad. This percent
talking measure varied from about 27% to 70% (M = 46.54,              Figure 6: Relationship between talking and performance.
