opportunities to score but couldn’t convert our chances”.
Design and Procedure The design and procedure were the
same as in Experiment 1. The only difference was that
contexts were presented prior to the onset of the metaphor
or literal utterance. Participants were able to read each
context at their own pace and press the enter key in order for
the word-by-word presentation of the item to start.
Results and Discussion

context, feature competitor, and feature salience. When

60, t = 3.07, p <. 01. When context was included in the
interaction terms, they were not significant; time bins 30 to
40, t = 95, p =.69 and time bins 50 to 60, t = .34, p = 71.
Context was, however, a significant predictor at time bins
30-40 for salient irrelevant features when the irrelevant
features were the competitor, t = 2.61, p < .03, but not at
time bins 50-60, t =.75, p = 53.
  Experiment 2 replicated the findings from Experiment 1 in
that early interference effects were observed for irrelevant
features and late interference effects were observed for
relevant features when the irrelevant feature was the most
salient. Both neutral and strong contexts showed the cross-
over interaction, however strong contexts only reduced the
early interference effects of irrelevant features for items for
which irrelevant features were the most salient. Taken
together, these findings provide evidence for suppression
accounts because relevant features still showed late
interaction effects even with strong contexts. This is not
predicted by the direct access view.
