                                                                 3438

Results and Discussion
Preliminary analysis revealed that the priming manipulation
affected all six simpatias equally, that is, in terms of efficacy
ratings, there was no main effect of specific simpatia used
and no interaction between specific simpatias and the prim-
ing procedures. Thus, the ratings of the six simpatias were
averaged to form a single index of ritual efficacy for each par-
ticipant. Results revealed that participants in the randomness
condition rated the simpatias as significantly more effective
(M = 4.33, SD = .31) than participants in the negativity con-
dition (M = 4.64, SD = .40), t(38) = 2.65, p < .05, (simpatias
with lower ratings were judged to be more effective than sim-
patias with higher ratings).
   This finding supports the hypothesis that the evaluation of
ritual efficacy increases when the motivation to reestablish
control is primed. Rituals may provide a mechanism for ac-
complishing this goal (Keinan, 2002). Alternatively, how-
ever, this pattern of data could potentially be explained by the
possibility that negativity reduced perceptions of efficacy, in-
stead of randomness increasing perceptions of efficacy. To
address this potential alternative explanation, in Study 2 we           Figure 1: Mean Efficacy Ratings per Condition in Study 2

      APPENDIX - Experimental Simpatias
Employment In the first day of last quarter phase of the
  moon, take the milk from a coconut and give it to the un-
  employed person to drink. After that, ask the person to spit
  three times in the hole made in the coconut. Following this,
  light up a brand-new white candle and drop the wax around
  the hole until the hole is sealed. Take the coconut to a far
  away beach or river.
Depression For five days, the person with depression should
  go to a crossroad. While there, the person should say: ”De-
  pression, stay here!” The person should not walk through
  the crossroad for one year.
Infidelity Throw a shoe and a shirt of the unfaithful person
  into a streaming river unbeknownst to the person. As the
  river flows away, you say: “I hope the river takes the infi-
  delity away as fast as it can.” Take some of the water from
  the river and keep it somewhere in the house.
Evil-Eye Fill a cup with sand spit inside the cup. Seal the
  cup and bury it upright before the sunrise.
