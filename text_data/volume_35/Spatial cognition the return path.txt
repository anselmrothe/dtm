better decisions were made if landmarks were located on
optimal positions. Since no decision time differences could
be obtained, this effect cannot be due to longer viewing
times for the landmarks. We may therefore conclude that the
quality of a landmark as a point of reference for finding the
return path very much depends on its position, as has
previously been assumed for the “initial path” (forward run;
Klippel & Winter, 2005; Röser et al., 2012a,b).
  The different learning conditions map and description
(allocentric/egocentric) did not lead to a significant
difference in the wayfinding phase, neither for correct
decisions nor for the response times. This absence of an

In the following we present current ideas on how landmarks,
places, and directions might be cognitively processed for the
return path. As we have seen so far from our first two
experiments on the return path and which role landmarks
and landmark positions play in this context, more systematic
empirical work is required.

perspective, whether both facades at one location at the
intersection are visually identical/similar (e.g., same color,
texture) or totally different (e.g., one facade is brown and
the other white). This may change the recognizability on the
return path in a dramatic way (Figure 3). For instance, if
both facades are similar, then this information can be used
for the return path, but if they differ significantly, then
position D becomes useless on the return path, since it
cannot be recognized anymore (only if the observer turns
the head on the initial path at the intersection). From a
perceptual point of view the object must be recognizable. If
this condition is not fulfilled, the former optimal position D
might become totally worthless (see Tables 1 and 2 for
theoretical predictions; please note the lower right value,
which has the most dramatic effects depending on visibility
and equal appearance).
