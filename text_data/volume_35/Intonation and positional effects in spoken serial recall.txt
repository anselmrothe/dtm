Abstract
Past studies have indicated that intonation, in the sense of
fundamental frequency modulation, can only enhance serial
recall to the extent that it can induce a grouping effect,
something that can also be induced by a simple insertion of
pauses. However, in a study of spoken serial recall of ninedigit lists, we are able to show that recall is significantly
better when sequences of digits are marked by specific
intonation contours than when they are simply grouped by
silent pauses in the signal. Thus, we found that intonation
plays a role during the encoding phase, whereby items in
group-final positions draw particular benefit from intonation.
However, intonation does not appear to play the same role in
the retrieval phase, since when subjects are instructed to
imitate intonation during recall, performance shows mixed
effects.
Keywords: serial recall; intonation; grouping effect; shortterm memory

Introduction
In field research, there is a general consensus that serial
recall (short-term memory in general) and prosody are
closely related. Well-documented evidence of such a
relationship is the grouping effect, that is, the enhanced
recall of items in a list when they are presented in groups
(for example, Reeves et al 2000). The grouping effect is
stronger for auditory stimuli (Cowan et al 2002, Frankish
1985), as prosody plays an important role in this grouping,
or patterning. Past and more recent research has aimed to
ascertain the nature of these groups. In their seminal work
on the auditory grouping effect, Frankish (1995) and Saito
(1998) provided evidence that it can be obtained by
temporal organisation of speech stimuli realised by pause
insertion between groups as well as by superimposing a
“natural” intonational pattern, or by manipulating pitch
levels on groups of items (Frankish 1995). On the other
hand, more recent studies have shown that the grouping
effect in serial recall reflects rhythmic groups, referred to as
the stress grouping effect, rather than intonational phrases
(Reeves et al 2000, Boucher 2006, Gilbert & Boucher
2007). It is argued that these groups correspond to the

segmentation units (chunks) listeners use in spoken
language perception (Gilbert et al 2011).
Previous research dealing specifically with the role of
intonation in improving serial recall suggests that it is
relevant to the extent that it can induce a similar grouping
effect to that obtained by pause insertion (Frankish 1995,
Saito 1998). However, a number of potentially relevant
aspects of intonation deserve further exploration. For
instance, in the previous studies discussed above, the
superimposition of a fundamental frequency (F0) contour1
on the whole sequence, or F0 manipulation on groups of
items within a sequence were carried out with little control
over specific tunes and their associated meanings. This is
particularly relevant, since the role of intonation in
signalling discourse structure is widely acknowledged, as it
cues hierarchical relationships among phrases within a
discourse unit (Hirschberg & Pierrehumbert 1986).
Moreover, in sequences intonation can convey information
about the hierarchical structure (groups) as well as about
specific positions within a group. In Italian (in particular the
variety of Bari), a rich inventory of tunes is available for
marking those kinds of hierarchical relationships in a
sequence (Savino 2001; 2004), among which the most
typical are:
- The “continuation rise” contour, a gradually rising F0
movement from the nuclear syllable up to the end of the
phrase. It signals that the list has not been completed yet,
and that more items are to come (“non-finality” contour);
- A high rising contour, where the rise in F0 starts before the
nuclear syllable and continues rising up to the end of the
phrase. It conveys the information that the current item is
the penultimate in a sequence, i.e. that the end of the list is
approaching (“pre-finality” contour”);
- A falling contour, involving a gradual fall from the nuclear
syllable until the end of the phrase. This contour marks the
end of a sequence (“finality” contour).
Our aim here is to verify whether the use of specific tunes
conveying such hierarchical relationships and positional

information within a sequence could improve immediate
serial recall performance of auditory stimuli in (Bari) Italian
listeners.
Another positive effect in serial recall performance reported
in the literature is the salience effect. It “occurs when an
item that is conspicuous on some perceptual dimension is
recalled better than other items in the same ensemble in
learning and memory tasks” (Reeves et al 2000: 1639). In
this paper we also explore the role of pitch prominence in
within-group (medial) positions in the sequence as another
potential factor in serial recall enhancement.
Moreover, we evaluate whether intonation plays a specific
role not only in encoding but also in retrieval of phrases, i.e.
whether performance is improved when listeners imitate the
tune of the input stimuli during recall.

Method and Materials
Intonational Patterns
In order to investigate the role of specific tunes in serial
recall, we identified two intonational patterns (we called
‘intonation contour A’ and ‘intonation contour B’)
characterised by F0 shapes conveying hierarchical
organisation of groups, as well as positional information of
items across and within groups. In a nine-digit sequence, we
determined:
- ‘Intonation contour A’, consisting of the “continuation
rise” (“non-final”) contour at positions 3 and 6, and a lowfalling (“final”) contour at position 9. F0 shapes of items at
initial and within-group positions (positions 2, 5, 7, 8) are
not positionally marked by intonation, as they are
characterised by a peak accent (taken to be the neutral
unmarked pattern).
A schematisation of intonation contour A is shown in Figure
1;
- ‘Intonation contour B’, sharing the same intonational
patterns of ‘intonation contour A’, except for a steep rising
pitch accent at positions 2 and 5. It can pre-signal the end of
the first and the second groups, i.e. the two non-final groups
within the signal. Also, because of the steep rising accentual
movement, these digits sound perceptually more salient than
the corresponding positions 2 and 5 in intonation contour A,
where they are marked by a (neutral) peak accent instead.
Another feature of contour B is a high rising (“pre-final”)
contour at position 8 pre-signalling both the end of the third
group and the end of the whole sequence.
A schematisation of ‘intonation contour B’ is given in
Figure 2.
These two experimental conditions were compared with two
further ones, namely:
- ‘Grouped by pauses’ sequences, where all digits have a
peak contour, and sequences are temporally grouped into
three by inserting a pause at the end of each group;
- ‘Ungrouped’ sequences, sharing the same intonation of the
‘grouped by pauses’ stimuli above, but without pause
grouping.
We hypothesise that serial recall performance would be

(H1) better in both intonation contours A and B and the
‘grouped by pauses’ conditions than in the ‘ungrouped’
(control) condition, due to the grouping effect;
(H2) better in both ‘contour A’ and ‘contour B’ than in the
‘grouped by pauses’ condition, because of the absence of
intonational marking of item position in the latter condition.
In particular, items in positions 3 (non-final contour=last
item in the first group), 6 (non-final contour=last item in the
second group), and 9 (final contour=last item in the third
group and in the whole sequence) should benefit in terms of
recall enhancement.
(H3) better with ‘intonation contour B’ than ‘intonation
contour A’ because of the enhanced hierarchical and
positional information conveyed by intonation in certain
positions, namely: digits at positions 2 (pre-final contour =
item at mid position in the first group), 5 (pre-final contour
= item at mid position in the medial group), and 8 (pre-final
contour = penultimate item in the whole sequence) This
should result in an overall better recall performance of
‘intonation contour B’ than of ‘intonation contour A’
sequences.
Moreover, we hypothesise that recall performance in both
intonation conditions
(H4) would be enhanced for subjects who are instructed to
imitate the intonation produced in the stimuli during the
recall task. This would provide some evidence that
intonation plays a relevant role not only in encoding but also
in retrieval of verbal material.
Our hypotheses can be summarized as follows:
Contour B > Contour A > Grouped by pauses > Ungrouped
on the one hand, and Imitation > No imitation on the other.

Stimuli
The sequences were created according to the four conditions
(‘ungrouped’, ‘grouped with pauses’, ‘intonation contour
A’, ‘intonation contour B’), three types of spoken stimuli for
each digit were created:
Type (a), where each digit was realised with a neutral F0
peak, as, for example, in digit position 1 in contours A and
B (see schematisation in Figures 1-2).
Type (b), where sequences were realised with intonation
contour A described above (see Figure 1)
Type (c), where sequences were produced with intonation
contour B described above (see Figure 2)

free to take a break any time they needed during the session.
A break was suggested after every block of 15 stimuli.
For each subject, the task involved recalling 60 stimuli
(preceded by a short training session) i.e. 15 stimuli for each
of the four conditions. The order of presentation was
balanced across the subjects.
Before starting the experimental trial, participants were
tested for their digit span of the WAIS-R (Wechsler 1987).
This step was carried out in order to ascertain that the digit
span of subjects was homogeneous across groups.
The average total duration of sessions (including the digit
span test) was around 40 min. Sessions were implemented
and run using SuperLab 2.0.

Pitch (Hz)

All series for each of the digits were produced by a trained
native speaker of Bari Italian (author MS) in the same
recording session. In this way, for each digit all intonational
realisations in each position (first, second, third, etc.) within
each sequence type were available. They were saved as
individual audio files, and used as “building blocks” for
creating all the nine-digit spoken sequences under the 4
conditions. Stimuli were created by concatenating the
individual audio files into nine-digit sequences. In a postediting step, care was taken that speech signal amplitude
was homogeneous in all sequences.
This methodology enabled us to create stimuli which sound
more natural than those produced by means of a speech
synthesiser, as in Frankish (1995).
Spoken digit realisations of type (a) were used for creating
sequences for the conditions ‘ungrouped’, and ‘grouped by
pauses’, in the latter case by inserting a 310 ms silence after
digits in positions 3 and 6. Spoken digit renditions of the
types (b) and (c) were used for creating sequences under the
conditions ‘intonation contour A’ and ‘intonation contour
B’, respectively.
We created 68 nine-digit lists from pseudo-random
permutation of the 1-9 digits, in a way to avoid the presence
of two adjacent digits in ascending or descending order, and
to make sure that a digit would not appear in the same
position in consecutive lists.
The concatenated nine-digit sequences were created on the
basis of these lists, the duration of each sequence averaging
6.4 sec. We produced 17 stimuli for each of the four
conditions, for a total amount of 68 stimuli (including 8 to
be used for the training session only, 2 per condition).
All steps for the preparation of stimuli were carried out
using the Praat software tool for speech analysis (Boersma
& Weenink 2001). Examples of a sequence (speech
waveform and F0 contour) for each of the four conditions
are shown in Figures 3-6.

Fifty-six subjects participated in the experiment. They were
undergraduate and graduate students of Psychology at the
University of Bari (average age: 23.6), with no reported
speech or hearing deficits. They were all native speakers of
Italian, born and living in the Bari geolinguistic area. None
of them had a background in phonetics or prosody.

Procedure
Participants was tested individually in a laboratory. They
were asked to listen to each sequence and recall all nine
digits orally by strictly observing their serial order. Half of
them were also instructed to imitate the intonation of the
sequence during the recall.
Subjects were seated in front of a computer and wore a
headset with headphones and microphone. Each list was
preceded by a warning tone and 500 ms silence. Spoken
responses were recorded directly and subjects proceeded to
the next sequence by pressing the spacebar. They were also

4) within group position (within subjects), 3 levels (first
position, second position, third position)
as factors.
First of all, a large effect of condition was found: F (3; 159)
= 52.75; p < 0.001; partial eta square = 0.5, performance
percentages for each condition: ungrouped=52%, grouped
by pauses=64%, intonation contour A=70%, intonation
contour B=69%). These results are in line with our
prediction in (H1), and confirm the typical grouping effect
in immediate serial recall of prosodically manipulated
auditory stimuli (Frankish 1995, Saito 1998).
Importantly, our hypothesis in (H2) is also verified, since
results show a statistically significantly better recall
performance for sequences with intonation contours A and
B than for those grouped simply by pauses (post-hoc
p<0.01). These results point to a specific role of intonation
in serial recall that goes beyond the grouping effect induced
by pauses, counter to the claims in previous studies.
We also found a significant second order interaction
between condition, serial group and within-group position:
F (12 ; 636) = 2.35; p < 0.01; partial eta square = 0.04, with
a moderate effect. Results (Figures 7-10) relating to
positions in the first and second serial groups show a better
performance for sequences realised with contours A and B,
with respect to those grouped by pauses. The effect is
particularly relevant for positions 3 and 6 (i.e. the last
position in the first and second groups). This can be seen by
comparing the “descending” shape of the correct response
bars for groups 1 and 2 in the ungrouped condition (Figure
7), with the “dipped” shape for the same group in the
remaining 3 conditions (Figures 8-10). The reverse tendency
is evident for the third group, with an “ascending” shape in
all conditions, pointing to an enhancement of the recency
effect in all conditions.

Hypothesis (H3) is not confirmed by our results, as we did
not obtain the expected specific effect in contour B for the
second (pre-final) position within the serial groups (i.e.
positions 2, 5 and 8 within the sequence, where 8 is also the
penultimate item position in the whole sequence).
For position 5, the salience potentially conveyed by the
steep rising pitch accent (compared to the “neutral” pitch
peak in the same position in contour A) does not appear to
improve recall of the medial item in a sequence.
With regard to Hypothesis H4, we did not find a main effect
of the imitation of intonation, even though this factor
interacts with a moderate effect with the serial groups: F (2 ;
106) = 5.82; p < 0.01; partial eta square = 0.1). Diagrams in

Conclusions
The aim of our study was to ascertain whether the use of
intonation patterns conveying hierarchical relationships
among and within groups in a sequence could improve
performance in an immediate serial recall task. Output

modality is oral channel, as in serial recall output modality
can have a considerable influence in task performance
(Penney 1979). Our results show that oral recall of spoken
lists is better when auditory stimuli are intonationally
marked by specific tunes than when they are simply
temporally grouped by pauses. Some positions particularly
benefitted from intonation: a rising non-final contour
marking serial positions 3 and 6 is more effective than
pauses.
On the other hand, we did not find clear evidence that a prefinal contour in positions 2 and 8 (marking penultimate
position within the first group, and penultimate position
within the whole sequence, respectively) can enhance recall
of items in these positions, also possibly because of the
masking effect of primacy and recency in adjacent positions.
It also appears that the item in medial position within the
whole sequence (position 5) cannot be better recalled when
made perceptually salient by pitch prominence.
These results indicate that intonation can be attributed a role
in the enhancement of serial recall that is not simply
equivalent to the temporal structuring induced by pauses, as
has so far been claimed. They also provide further support
to the “language-oriented” view of Short-Term Memory
(STM) as opposed to models of STM that propose a
specialised memory system that is hierarchically organised
(Farrell & Lelièvre 2012).
We also found that particular intonation patterns can
improve recall only in the input modality, i.e. when it is
presented in auditory stimuli, but not in the output modality,
i.e. when subjects are requested to imitate the intonation of
the auditory stimuli whilst recalling. In the latter case,
imitation cannot be construed as a supporting strategy for
the recalling task. Instead it interfered with the task,
resulting in a decrease in performance in the last part of the
sequence, as memory traces become weaker.
Such result that imitation of the intonation does not enhance
serial recall points to supporting the “language-oriented”
models of Short-Term Memory.
