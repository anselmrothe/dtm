   Order effects of measurements are not unique to physics.
It has long been recognized that the order of questions can
influence human judgments and decisions (Schuman &
Presser, 1981; Sudman & Bradburn, 1974). For example,
the Pew Research Center conducted a telephone survey
experiment during June 10-14, 2009 with a nationally
representative sample of 1,502 U.S. adults. A random half
of the sample was asked, “Do you approve or disapprove of
the way Barack Obama is handling his job as President?”
followed by “All in all, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with
the way things are going in this country today?” The other
half was asked the exact same questions but in the opposite
order. It turns out that the presidential job approval rate was     years. There are 26 surveys in total, with a nationally

between randomly-split samples to balance out question
order effects. Whether the order of two questions produces
significant effects can be easily tested. Denote p(AyBn) as
the probability of agreeing (“yes”) to question A and then
disagreeing (“no”) to question B, and p(BnAy) as the
probability of the same answers when the questions were
asked in the opposite order. Similarly, probabilities of the
remaining response combinations, p(AnBy) and p(ByAn),
are defined. The two order conditions produce a pair of 2×2
contingency tables, which, according to the null hypothesis,
should be equivalent except for sampling error (e.g.,
p(AyBn) = p(BnAy)). Discrepancy from the null hypothesis               Figure 1: χ2 frequency distributions for testing the order
