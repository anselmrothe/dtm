   Note that only two of the sentences actually described
what was seen in the movie. If a subject selected one of the
two nonsensical sentences we coded the answer as an error.
Design and Prediction We recoded subjects’ responses
according to the color coding as “X launched Y” vs. “Y
stopped X” (plus error), and aggregated the eight col-
or/rotation versions to align with a consistent X/Y assign-
ment. We expected an increasing selection rate for “Y
stopped X” and a decreasing selection rate for “X launched
Y”, respectively, from Condition A to Condition D. 1

Method
Participants A new set of 34 students (23 women; mean

participated in this experiment using the same design as in
Experiment 1.
Material and Procedure We used the same set of 32 mov-

forced choice decision between scene descriptions, we pre-
sented subjects with the two sentences (adapted to the re-
spective color version), and requested them to rate how well
