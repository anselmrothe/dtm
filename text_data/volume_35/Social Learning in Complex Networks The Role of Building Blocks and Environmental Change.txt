Decision environment
Two factors affecting the decision environment were varied
in different simulations: a) the number of options available
and b) the rate of environmental change. To manipulate the
first factor we assumed that agents choose either between 2

Evolutionary competition
   In order to properly evaluate each strategy we look at
their performance both in isolation (in homogeneous groups
using the same strategy) and by directly testing different
strategies against each other (heterogeneous groups) in an
evolutionary competition. In the former we are interested in
isolating the factors contributing to the success of different
strategies, whereas in the latter we wish to evaluate them in
a competitive setting where the performance of a strategy
can depend on the strategies used by other agents in the
group. Evolutionary competitions are a popular method in
the study of social learning (e.g. Rendell, et al. 2010) where
the strategy accumulating the highest payoff has the best
chance of reproducing and spreading in the population,
while the worst performing strategies die out. The
prevalence of a strategy is, therefore, a clear-cut measure of
its success in a given environment.
   There are many ways to implement an evolutionary
dynamic. Here we chose the ‘imitation process’ (Nowak,
2006) in order to reflect a plausible real-life scenario. We
assumed that on each time-step, randomly selected agents
change their strategies to one of their contacts’ strategy with
a probability proportional to the cumulative payoff of that
contact. If none of the contacts has a higher payoff, the
agent keeps its strategy, and in situations of equal payoff
