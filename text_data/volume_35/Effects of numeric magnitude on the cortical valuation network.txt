Abstract

rewarded just one. A special case of using magnitude for
valuation is the use of monetary rewards. By using money,
dissimilar goods can be compared on the same scale (e.g.,
dollars or cents) and can be described with just one value,
its numeric magnitude (e.g., +300 or -300).
Although translation of value into a numeric scale has
many benefits, it may also come with a price. Numeric
magnitude, like luminance and loudness, has a compressive
psychophysical scale (Fechner, 1860/1966; Weber,
1846/1948; Dehaene, 1997). Thus, the difference between
10 and 15 appears larger than the difference between 120
and 125.
The compressive nature of numerical judgments is
important because it may play a large role in how the brain
tracks monetary value and makes economic decisions
(Furlong & Opfer, 2009; Peters et al., 2008). Indeed, “unit
effects” on decision-making have been known for many
decades. For example, Kahneman and Tversky (1981)
observed that participants were willing to trade 20 minutes
of their time to save $5 on a $15 calculator, but not on a
$125 jacket, even though in both cases they are trading 20
minutes of their time for the same amount of money (i.e.
$5). Although, these effects can be explained by assuming
that subjects pay more attention to the proportional gains,
the compressive function of numeric representations might
provide another explanation. Because larger numerals have
smaller psychological distances between them, the
difference between a $125 and $120 jacket is subjectively
less than the difference between a $15 and $10 calculator.
In this paper, we were interested in why neural activation
also appears to devalue marginal monetary gains.
Specifically, we addressed whether the neural response to
increasing quantities of money are caused by increases in
objective monetary value (the value hypothesis), by
increases in the numeric magnitude used to represent the
magnitude of the monetary reward (the number hypothesis),
both, or neither. This issue is important because
neuroeconomists typically assume that the brain areas
responsible for processing monetary rewards are not
affected by the magnitudes of the numerals that represent
the rewards, but this assumption has never been tested.

Previous work has identified a distributed, network of neural
systems involved in appraising the value of rewards, such as
when winning $100. We hypothesized that involvement of
intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in this network is specialized for
processing numeric rather than monetary value. To test our
hypothesis, we manipulated numeric magnitude and units to
construct a range of economic rewards (e.g., +$1, +100¢) in
response to simple decisions. Consistent with our hypothesis,
BOLD activity in IPS was related to changes in numeric
magnitude, independent of monetary value, whereas activity
in OFC was associated with monetary value, independent of
numeric magnitude. Finally, by using representation
similarity analysis, we found that the information represented
in IPS and OFC was more consistent with the patterns
expected if representations of numeric magnitudes or
monetary values, respectively, were in a compressive scale.
Together, these findings show the importance of numerical
cognition for understanding how the brain processes monetary
rewards.

Introduction
Humans are continuously faced with choices, often
involving incommensurable options. When choosing among
options for a romantic date, for example, it is not clear how
to compare the esthetic pleasure of a movie with the
gustatory pleasure of a nice dinner. Making decisions
apparently requires computing the value of each option in
some way that would register the difference in values
(Montague, King-Casas & Cohen, 2006).
Economic models have long assumed that humans behave
‘as if’ they compute value for each option in a common
mental currency (i.e., subjective value), and experiments on
the distributed neural correlates of valuation (i.e., valuation
network) suggest that this assumption may be correct (Kable
& Glimcher, 2009; Padoa-Schioppa & Asad, 2006, 2008;
but see Vlaev, et al., 2011; Tremblay & Schultz, 1999;
Seymour et al., 2007; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005).
One of the sources of information that comprise this
common mental currency is the magnitude of the reward.
Being rewarded two cookies feels better than being

susceptible to manipulations of numeric magnitude even
when these manipulations do not change the objective
monetary value of the rewards.

The Valuation Network: Neural Correlates of
Monetary Value
Research in the field of neuroeconomics has suggested the
existence of a neural valuation network. This network
computes the subjective value of options under
consideration and uses that valuation to make choices. The
most critical brain areas associated with economic value are
the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)/ventromedial prefrontal
cortex (VMPFC), striatum, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) (Glimcher, 2009; Kable
& Glimcher, 2009). In theory, the function of this valuation
network is to integrate the multiple value dimensions of an
option to provide a one-dimensional scale of subjective
value according to which choices can be ranked for future
decisions.
Of critical importance for this paper are the roles of OFC
and PPC. Both studies in monkeys and humans have
consistently shown the importance of OFC in the valuation
process. There are, however, different ways in which that
value can be represented. Although some studies have found
neurons in OFC that are associated with absolute value
(Paddoa-Schioppa & Assad, 2006, 2008; Tom et al., 2007),
other studies have found that other neurons in OFC are also
associated with relative value with adaptive scaling
(Kennerley, Behrens & Wallis, 2011; Tremblay & Schultz,
1999).
Parietal cortex activity related to valuation processes has
been located in the lateral inferior parietal cortex (LIP) of
monkeys and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) – its human
homologue (Clithero, Carter, & Huettel, 2009; Kable &
Glimcher, 2009; Platt & Glimcher, 1999). For instance,
using pattern classification techniques, activity in IPS was
related to the value of options, and it was even able to
distinguish between intertemporal and probabilistic
valuations (Clithero et al., 2009). Also, their data suggest
that IPS is critical for the initial stages of valuation by
representing and integrating the information necessary for
computation of economic value in OFC and the striatum.
Also, activation of IPS has recently been related to the
outcome of monetary rewards, but not to the outcome of
social rewards (Lin, Adolphs & Rangel, 2011). This result is
important since it shows that the presence of (numeric)
magnitude information in the reward presented may be a
critical component of the value representation in IPS.
However, the meaning of magnitude in the studies
reviewed is ambiguous. Because numeric magnitude and
value magnitude typically go hand in hand, it is not possible
to know if the increases in activation in IPS (or OFC) are
related to an increase in the value of the reward or in the
numbers used to represent that value. Moreover, there is
strong evidence that suggests that IPS is a central area in the
processing of numeric information (Arsalidou & Taylor,
2011 for a meta analysis). Therefore, we suggest – as an
alternative hypothesis – that while OFC does process reward
value, the role of IPS in these studies is to process the
numeric magnitudes of the rewards being considered. If
true, the activity of the valuation network would be

Present Study
Recently, Furlong and Opfer (2009) provided a method to
discern between these two possibilities at the behavioral
level. Although economic theories assume that the
magnitude of the numbers should not affect economic
behavior, Furlong and Opfer showed that in fact numeric
magnitude and not economic value explained the degree of
cooperation of participants in a prisoner’s dilemma task.
The device used to prove this point was exceedingly simple.
By manipulating the unit of the rewards between dollars and
cents, it was possible to achieve rewards with the same
objective economic value while drastically changing the
numeric magnitude associated with the same reward (e.g. $1
= 100¢). This simple manipulation makes it possible to
provide participants with a variety of rewards in such a way
that allows to parametrically vary numeric magnitude and
economic value independently.
To test whether IPS processes numeric magnitude or
economic value, we conducted a functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) study that was designed to
introduce linear transformations to the magnitudes of
rewards. In order to properly disambiguate the effects of
numeric magnitude from those of monetary value on the
valuation network, we developed a scratch-off lottery game
in which we could manipulate the units (between dollars and
cents) of the monetary rewards given to participants.

Method
Participants
Seventeen adults participated (mean age 22.2, range 18-41;
10 female). All were right-handed, had normal or correctedto-normal vision and reported no neurological problems.
One participant was excluded for failing to complete the
task and complaints of headaches during scanning.

Design and Procedure
Participants were recruited to play a lottery game; $15 was
guaranteed for playing plus the chance to earn $0 to $20
more depending on the value of tickets uncovered during the
experiment. To uncover extra money, participants had to
choose between two covered tickets (represented as two
gray rectangles on a computer screen) by pressing one of
two buttons on a button box. After choosing a ticket, the
amount of extra money earned (or lost) would be revealed.
Participants had only one second to choose a ticket lest the
choice be made for them; were 25 tickets missed during the
session, all extra money would be forfeit.
Unbeknownst to participants, the lottery was rigged in
several ways to optimize data for our experiment. First, the
sequence of rewards and the jittered intertrial interval were
presented in a pseudo-random order, determined by a
custom MATLAB script (Poldrack, 2011) that optimizes

723

contrast efficiencies of fMRI event-related designs. Jittered
intertrial intervals varied from 2s to 8s and were derived
from a pseudoexponential distribution (mean ITI = 4s). The
optimization routine was created for each of the 5 individual
runs, and order of runs varied randomly between subjects.
Thus, participants had no actual control of the amount of
money they received.
Critically, values of tickets came from all possible
combinations of 5 numbers (i.e., 0, 1, 3, 100, 300), 2 units
(i.e., dollars and cents) and 2 valences (i.e., win and loss).
Combined, these components yielded a range of 17 possible
tickets: (-1¢, -3¢, -100¢, -300¢, -$1, -$3, -$100, -$300, 0,
+1¢, +3¢, +100¢, +300¢, +$1, +$3, +$100, +$300). To
control for number of digits and position of units, rewards
were presented such that valence signs always appeared in
the leftmost position, units rightmost, and numbers between
with three digits and one dot (e.g., “- 1.00 ¢”).
The experiment consisted of 5 fMRI runs of 8 minutes
each. Each run contained 57 trials, 51 trials corresponding to
3 repetitions of each of the 17 different tickets, and 6 extra
tickets. Extra trials were added because equal repetitions of
all tickets would yield no net gain thereby earning
participants no extra money. Instead, the lottery was rigged
so all participants earned an extra $10.50 from the 30 extra
tickets distributed randomly over the 5 runs.

MCFLIRT motion correction procedure were also included
in the models as regressors of no interest. Whole brain
statistical analyses were performed using a multi-stage
approach to implement a mixed-effects model treating
participants as random-effects. Regressors of interest were
constructed by convolving a boxcar function representing
the onset time of the stimulus, the magnitude of the
parametric regressor and its duration with a canonical
double-gamma (HRF). All reported results in the following
section were assessed for cluster-wise significance (P <
0.05, FWE-corrected) using a defining threshold of Z > 2.3.

Results
Behavioral Results
To ensure that participants were paying attention to the task,
they were instructed to choose a lottery ticket within 1s of
their onset on the screen. The typical participant was very
attentive and only missed 3.88 tickets (range 0 – 11).

Imaging Results
The experimental design of this study allowed examining
the effects of manipulating numeric magnitude, units and
valence on neural activity. Wins and losses were modeled
separately in agreement with prospect theory (Kahneman &
Tversky, 1979). For space reasons, we will only describe
results concerning winning trials.
Win Trials
As predicted by the number hypothesis, we found that
bilateral activation of IPS was related to increases in
numeric magnitude, but not to increases in monetary value.
The activation clusters associated with the number
parametric regressor extended to adjacent areas in lateral
occipital cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, superior parietal
lobule and angular gyrus. Also, we found significant
clusters in middle frontal gyrus. (Fig. 1). Further, no clusters
showed a negative relation between number and neural
activation. These patterns are consistent with the literature
on number processing (Arsalidou & Taylor, 2011) and show
the importance of numeric information in the processing of
monetary rewards. Further, these findings contradict the
idea that the role of IPS in the valuation network is to
compute economic value (Glimcher, 2009).
Conversely, activity in bilateral OFC, insula, inferior
frontal gyrus, ACC, VMPFC, angular gyrus, and lateral
occipital gyrus, (Fig. 2) was associated with increases in
monetary value. These results are consistent with what is
known about the neural correlates of absolute value (Kable
& Glimcher, 2009; Padoa-Schioppa & Assad, 2008).
Activity associated with the units regressor (i.e. greater
activity for dollars than for cents) was found in areas of
bilateral OFC, insula, VMPFC, paracingulate cortex, ACC,
and left striatum (Fig. 1). Here, areas that show significant
relations with receiving rewards in dollars overlap with the
areas associated with increases in monetary rewards. This
overlap makes sense because – all else being equal –

fMRI Scanning Parameters
Imaging data was collected on a Siemens Tim
MAGNETOM Trio 3T MRI scanner. For registration of
images, we used a T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (TR =
1900ms; TE = 4.68ms). In each run, we acquired 237
whole-brain T2* weighted echo planar images (TR =
2100ms; TE = 25ms; flip angle 90°). The first 4 volumes of
images were discarded to allow for stabilization of the
scanner. Parameters of functional scans were selected to
minimize susceptibility problems associated with imaging
of prefrontal cortex (PFC).

Data Analysis
fMRI data were analyzed using FEAT 5.98 (FMRI Expert
Analysis Tool) from FSL toolbox (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl).
Preprocessing of data consisted of brain extraction, motion
correction, spatial smoothing with a 5mm (FWHM)
Gaussian kernel, and registration to standard MNI space.
Statistical analyses were conducted with a whole-brain
GLM parametric analysis in which parametric regressors
were created to model wins and losses separately to account
for the different subjective value functions predicted by
prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Specifically,
activity for each trial was modeled using units (i.e. dollars =
1, cents = -1) and numbers (i.e. 1, 3, 100, 300) as regressors:
BOLD(wins) = Units(wins) + Number(wins)
(Number(wins) * Units(wins))
BOLD(losses) = Units(losses) + Number(losses) +
(Number(losses) * Units(losses))

Where the Number*Units interaction corresponds to the
objective monetary value of each ticket. In addition to these
regressors of interest, motion correction parameters from

changing the unit of the received lottery ticket from cents to
dollars entailed a 100-fold increase in monetary value.
Saturday, April 27, 13
Conversely,
areas of left postcentral gyrus, anterior IPS, and
right lateral occipital gyrus showed greater activity for cents
than for dollars. Following a similar logic, a change from
dollars to cents – holding the amount of money constant –
entailed a 100-fold increase in numeric magnitude.
However, as can be seen in Fig. 1 and unlike in the previous
case, the areas in posterior parietal cortex that showed
significant BOLD activity related to cents do not overlap
with the areas associated with increases in numeric
magnitude.
Evidence that PPC activation is associated with numeric
magnitude adds to the current literature of the neural
correlates of valuation by pointing out an important
confound present in all studies of valuation that have used
monetary rewards. Several of these studies have reported
IPS activity and as a result have suggested that PPC is
directly implicated in the network that computes economic
value (Ballard & Knutson, 2009; Clithero et al., 2009; Hare,
et al., 2011; Lin, et al., 2011; Louie, et al., 2011;
Nieuwenhuis, et al., 2005; Platt & Glimcher, 1999).
However, the present results suggest that the involvement of
IPS in the valuation network is related to the processing of
numeric magnitude information and not to economic value.
Conversely, signatures of absolute monetary values were
obtained in OFC, VMPFC, striatum and ACC. In these
areas, the magnitudes of the numbers used to represent the
economic values did not affect the representation of
economic value. These results are consistent with the
previous literature (Kable & Glimcher, 2009) since these are
all major areas of the suggested neural network charged
with processing economic value. Combined, the findings
from winning tickets are in agreement with the idea that
there are in fact multiple valuation networks that may have
different properties.
Representation Similarity Analysis
An important question underlying this study is whether
brain regions like IPS or OFC treat 100¢ more like $1 (same
economic value) or like $100 (same numeric value). One
way to answer this question is to examine how the

L

information of interest is represented in a particular brain
area. Here, the main goal is not just to detect activation, but
to characterize the information present in the particular area
Saturday, April 27, 13
(Kriegeskorte & Bandettini, 2007). Representation
similarity analysis (RSA; Kriegeskorte, Mur & Bandettini,
2008) is one kind of multivariate approach to fMRI data
analysis that tries to accomplish this. RSA aims to find
correspondences between the relations among stimuli, and
the relations between the patterns of brain activation in a
particular brain area in response to the same stimuli.
Therefore, RSA can be applied to the present problem, since
it can provide an answer to the question of whether a given
brain area treats the full matrix of monetary rewards more
like the numerical representation of those rewards or more
like a sequence of distinct monetary values.
Furthermore, we were interested in comparing multiple
theories of how the brain patterns of activity elicited by the
full set of stimuli might be related. For the purposes of this
study, RSA allowed us to compare the patterns of brain
activity from anatomical regions of interest (ROI’s) to the
patterns expected if the given brain area processes numeric
magnitude (both in linear and logarithmic scales), or
monetary value (both in linear and logarithmic scales).
Additionally, by using RSA we were able to check if
positive and negative rewards were treated equally or not.
To conduct RSA, we computed dissimilarity matrices
(DSMs) among all presented stimuli for the patterns of
activity in each ROI, as well as for each theoretical model.
Once these DSMs were obtained, Spearman correlations
were computed between the ROIs and the model DSMs.
This analysis allowed us to rank order the ROI-model
similarities (Fig. 3).
As can be seen in Fig. 4, the DSM obtained from IPS
activation was more similar to the DSM expected if the
information represented were numeric magnitude in a log
scale. Conversely, the DSM obtained from OFC activation
was more similar to the DSM expected if the information
represented were monetary value in a log scale (Fig. 4).
These results not only are consistent with the GLM results
presented in the previous section, but also provide important
additional information regarding the details of the neural

magnitudes. The compressive scales that we use to represent
money imply that it is very likely that decisions made with
very large values would not be consistent with the decisions
made in an equivalent situation with smaller numeric
magnitudes. If monetary values are treated differently when
only the numbers used to represent them are different,
people might be easily deceived in supporting proposals that
go against their own preferences.
