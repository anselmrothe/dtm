   Thus, the second goal of our study is to examine how
people adapt their spatial descriptions when faced with
different cues. Specifically, we aim to clarify the extent to
which they rely on their memory representations when
describing information. We do so by dissociating the
learning of spatial arrays from their description (cf., Shelton
& McNamara, 2004). Our earlier work suggests that
speakers don’t merely rely on their initial representations
during descriptions, but are able to use available perceptual
information (i.e., their degree of misalignment from their                         Figure 1: The seven-object array used,

known, Matchers sat at a separate, identical table next to the
Director’s (see Figure 2), at the position they would occupy
during the description (at 0° or at 135°).
Testing phase After ensuring that Directors memorized the
array, Directors moved to an adjacent room to complete the
memory tasks (JRDs and the drawing task). On JRD trials,
Directors were instructed to imagine being at one location
facing a second, constituting an imagined heading or
viewpoint, and to point to a third object, the target (e.g.,
Imagine being at the bucket, facing the marble. Point to the
candle.). Directors first read a statement in this form (i.e.,
“Imagine being at x, facing y”), pressed a button on a
joystick once they adopted that heading, and then responded
to the second statement (“Point to z”) by deflecting the
joystick in the direction of z as if they were facing y and
pressing a button to log in their response. Sixty-four such
