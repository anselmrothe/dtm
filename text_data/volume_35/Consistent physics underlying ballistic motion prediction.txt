Cutting task.         We calculated the projected landing
positions of the ball as a function of each release time
chosen by participants, per trial. Participants' mean landing
positions were highly correlated with the actual bucket
positions (r=0.98, SumSq = 187*103), and were again
highly consistent with each other (split-half correlation:
r=0.998). Participants also demonstrated a distinct bias,
which differed from that in the catching task: when the
bucket was near the horizontal position of the pendulum's
nadir, participants' mean landing positions were shifted
away from it, but when the bucket was far from the nadir,
their mean landing positions were shifted toward it (note the
sigmoid curvature in Fig. 4). This high inter-participant
correlation again suggests a common bias across people.

which release time would cause the ball to land in the

subject to errors that reflected realistic constraints on
people's timing precision.
Catching task
Description. Because the ball was motionless while
participants placed the bucket, participants were required to
remember the velocity of the ball and form their judgment
based on that memory. This could introduce biases that
would cause participants to recall the velocity as slightly
different than it had actually been before the pause                        Figure 6: Catching task. Model's bucket positions (x-axis)

position was Gaussian noise. This placement noise could
arise from noise in either the motor system during
placement, uncertainty in estimation of the velocity of the
ball, or simulation uncertainty that accumulates

Vul, 2013).3

motor behaviors. As a result, if the participant intended to
release the ball at time t, they may have instead released it at
time t+ε. Because the physical dynamics induce a non-
linear relationship between ε and the error in landing
position, a rational participant should select a time for which
the probability of the ball landing in the bucket is highest
rather than when it would land closest to the bucket center.
If people understand their own timing imprecision (as
reported in Hudson, Maloney, & Landy, 2008), then they
should marginalize over ε in order to maximize their chance
of success. If R* is the intended release time, R is the actual
release time, and terr is the variability in timing, the
probability of hitting the bucket given R* is:

maximum modes of P(hit|R*). Puzzlingly, people did not
always choose the optimal (higher probability) mode given
the model assumptions, but instead often favored the
suboptimal mode. This suboptimality may have been due to
participants' desire to accumulate more information by
waiting for the later time (Battaglia & Schrater, 2007; Faisal
& Wolpert, 2009), or minimize trial duration by selecting
the earlier time. Since our model did not capture such
factors, we simply set the model's choice of modes to match
the participants' proportion.                                                Figure 9: (Left) Variability in empirical ball landings by
