                       Experiment 1
Experiment 1 examined whether explanation influenced
preschoolers’ extension of a hidden, internal property to
other objects that shared either perceptual or causal
properties. Children observed four sets of three objects
individually placed on a toy that played music when
“activated” (see Gopnik & Sobel, 2000). Each set contained
three objects: one that activated the toy (target object), one
that was perceptually identical to the target object, but
failed to activate the toy (perceptual match), and one that
was perceptually dissimilar to the target object, but
successfully activated the toy (causal match). After each
outcome was observed, children were asked to either
explain (explain condition) or report (control condition) that
outcome. Next, children received additional information
about the target object: an internal part was revealed.
Children were asked which one of the two other objects in            Figure 1: Sample set of objects used in Experiment 1 (top)

    Next the experimenter pointed to the set of objects and
said, “Look! They have little doors. Let’s open one up.”
The experimenter selected the target object and removed the
cap to reveal the red map pin that had been hidden inside.
The experimenter said, “Look! It has a little red thing inside
of it. Can you point to the other one that also has something
inside?” Children were then encouraged to point to one of
the two remaining objects (i.e., the perceptual match or the
causal match) to indicate which contained the same inside
part, and this selection was recorded. Children could either
select the block that was perceptually identical to the target
or the object that shared the causal property, but not both.
    Following their selection, children were not provided
feedback, nor were they allowed to explore the blocks.
Instead, all blocks were removed from view, and the next
set was produced. This procedure was repeated for the three
remaining sets. Each child participated in a total of four sets.
Children were given a score of “1” for selecting the causal
match and a “0” for selecting the perceptual match;
children thus received 0-4 points across the four sets.
