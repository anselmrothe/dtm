Micah Edelson
The underlying brain mechanisms through which the
social environment influences human memory are
unknown. Dr. Edelson reports on studies of memory in
individuals exposed to contradictory recollections of
others. Using fMRI, the research finds that social milieu
influences memory through evolutionary conserved
medial temporal circuits, whereas the ability to overcome
social influence is mediated by newer prefrontal circuits.
The interplay between these systems determines the
balance of personal memory versus conformity to the
group.
