Emotion words vs. emotionally valenced words
   One essential factor that has been neglected so far in
large-scale studies of emotion in lexical processing is
whether any valence effect is being driven by a specific,
limited set of words: those referring explicitly to emotion
(e.g. love, shame, joy, hate in contrast to valenced words not
directly referring to emotions, e.g. prison, cake, justice,
cheat). For example, Altarriba and Bauer (2004) argue that
emotion words are sufficiently different to other types of
words that we ought to consider words as falling into three
categories: concrete, abstract and emotion words. Moreover,
it has been argued that emotion words may be embodied not
only internally (via emotional experience, as argued by
Kousta et al., 2011) but also due to body states associated
