participants given incidental learning conditions showed the
strongest evidence of learning for subsequences containing
an alternation (e.g. YYX, YXY) and the least evidence of
learning for subsequences consisting of runs of the same
response (XXX). However, when participants were
presented with two cue positions and given instructions to
predict what would happen on the next trial, this pattern of
results was reversed, with the best learning occurring for the
more salient XXX subsequences. This study shows that the
effect of explicit instructions can differentially affect certain
subsequences. Giving participants the intention to learn or
alluding to the existence of sequences does not entail that all
subsequences will benefit from these manipulations.
However, the fact that learning in the SRT task is even
affected by these manipulations suggests that sequence
