Because the discrimination tasks do not easily allow for the

previous research (Lindskog et al., 2013) indicates that
proportion correct is just as reliable and valid as w, we used
proportion correct as a measure of performance in all of the
four tasks.

Second, it might be that participants’ sensitivity is higher

& Creelman, 2005). We designed Experiment 3 to
distinguish between these two possibilities.
                        Experiment 2
Experiment 2 investigated the origin of the TOE observed in
Experiment 1. Participants made direct estimates of the
number of displayed dots in a task closely matching the
sequential tasks from Experiment 1.
Method
Participants. Twenty undergraduate students took part in
the study, 12 females and 8 males. Average age was 24.8            Figure 3: Mean judgments of the three numerosities when

Stimulus and procedure. Stimuli were three numbers of
dots (8, 11, and 14) that were presented in temporal
sequence in stimulus pairs (e.g. 8 – 11, 14 – 8 etc.) in a
randomized order in a fully crossed design (two presentation
positions (first/second) by three numerosities (8/11/14)).
The dots were either blue or yellow. The sequence of colors
was always the same for each participant, but randomized
between subjects. Each stimulus pair was presented 9 times.
Intermixed with these stimulus pairs each numerosity also
occurred in isolation as a control. Together this made up 96
trials per participant. The numerosities were presented for
200ms, with a blank interstimulus interval of 300ms. Half of
the trials were controlled for average dot-size, half for
cumulative area. The task consisted of directly estimating
