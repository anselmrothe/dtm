are explicitly given the category assignments for the stimuli.
Instead participants may search for features that characterize
each category or the similarity amongst objects in each
category.
   Put another way, if participants passively study the
stimuli along with their correct category assignments, their
self-imposed task may be to identify the features that
characterize that category (e.g., that all the ‘Zups’ have a
similar nose shape). By contrast, if participants are not given
the category assignment but instead have to try to categorize
the stimulus and only then receive feedback, they may focus
on finding differences between objects of different
categories (e.g., that ‘Zups’ are round and ‘Rikes’ are
squares; see Markman & Ross, 2003; Yamauchi &
Markman, 2000).

assignment was shown on the screen for 2 s. The mapping
between the position of the buttons on the screen and the

   For both groups, a 1000 ms inter-trial interval followed
the trial and then the next trial began. In the blocked
condition, the categories presented alternated 25% of the
time while in the interleaved condition they alternated 75%
of the time. That is, in the interleaved condition, the
probability of an object being followed by an object of the
same category was low, whereas for the blocked condition
this probability was high. We used this probabilistic
approach rather than creating purely interleaved or blocked
conditions in order to diminish the possibility that
participants noticed the pattern of alternation in responses,
which would affect categorization accuracy. Furthermore, if
a purely blocked condition had been used there would be no
way to guarantee participants’ attention to the task, as there
would be no uncertainty as to the correct categorization.              Figure 2: Results from the Study Phase for the Active
