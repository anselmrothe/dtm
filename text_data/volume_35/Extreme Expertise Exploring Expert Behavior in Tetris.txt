to effectively negotiate the error cost and the increasing time
pressure by employing cognitive abilities such as: use of
working memory, mental rotations, perceptual comparisons,
strategic planning, and prediction, as well as the dexterous
and rapid execution of chains of motor commands. Master-
ing Tetris requires the novice to coordinate the effective and
efficient use all of these cognitive resources, abilities, and
strategies. For these reasons, we see Tetris as an excellent
platform for investigating the acquisition of expertise in a dy-
namic, real-time task.
    In addition, Tetris has been used to document a variety of
cognitive phenomena. A short list includes: epistemic versus
pragmatic action (Destefano, Lindstedt, & Gray, 2011; Kirsh
