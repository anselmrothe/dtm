Preliminary Analysis
Data from the practice session suggest that participants in
general are able to correctly estimate the time interval.
Similar to Ebert and Wagner (2011), we calculated the mean                                      (a)

two standard deviations from the mean (r = 0.2112) was
removed from further analysis. In the main experimental
session, the outcome (target hit/miss) was not controlled or
counterbalanced across SOA (given that this is completely
dependent on the performance of the participant in a given
trial). Hence, to remove bias due to the unbalanced aspect of
target hit/miss, we performed a correlation between target
accuracy and SOA. The correlation between accuracy and                                         (b)
