   Each listening session was followed by a test session.
Sixteen test stimuli were presented in each of the three test
sessions, where 8 sequences were Old (had been presented
previously) and 8 were New. After each test sequence,
participants responded “Yes” or “No” to whether they had
heard the sequence before. Upon responding, the listener
made a confidence rating on a scale from 1 to 5 where ‘1’
represented not confident and ‘5’ represented very
confident.
   The 24 sequences of the listening sessions each comprised
24 isochronous tones, played in a piano timbre. Each tone
was 500 ms in duration, yielding sequences that were 12-
seconds-long each. The sequences were generated with an
alphabet of 7 pitches (representing one octave of the
diatonic scale). A first-order Markov transition matrix was
derived (Pearce, 2005) from the scale degrees of Canadian
folk songs/ballads, Chorale melodies, and German folk
songs in a major key (the same corpus described in Table 2
of Pearce and Wiggins, 2006). To construct the tone
sequences, many transition matrices were generated
randomly using a process biased towards the tonal transition
matrix. From each matrix, one sequence of 24 notes was
sampled. A subset of these was then selected manually to
ensure a good spread in the 3-dimensional subjective
information space formed by the information theoretic
measures described above.
   A distinct 500 ms white noise clip was played after every
tone sequence in the listening and test sessions as a
perceptual “reset” to ensure that expectedness ratings and
memory judgments were based only on the current trial. The
study was administered on a MacBook Pro laptop, and
stimuli were presented and responses collected using
Psychophysics Toolbox (Version 3) within the
programming       environment      of    MATLAB       2010a
(MathWorks, Inc). Participants listened to stimuli over
headphones set to a comfortable listening volume.
