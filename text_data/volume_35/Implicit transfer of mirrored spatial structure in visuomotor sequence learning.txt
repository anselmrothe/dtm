                           Method
Participants
120 right-handed participants (68 males, 52 females; mean
age = 21.19 years, standard deviation = 2.31) participated in
the experiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-
normal visual acuity, normal motor functions, and were
naïve to the purpose of this study. All procedures were
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Procedure
We adopted a basic experimental paradigm used in previous
studies (e.g., Hikosaka et al., 1995; Watanabe et al., 2010;
Figure1). The experimental device consisted of 16 LED
buttons mounted in a 4 × 4 matrix and another LED button
(called the “home key”) at the bottom. Participants used
their right index fingers to press the buttons. When
participants pressed the home key for 500 ms, three buttons
