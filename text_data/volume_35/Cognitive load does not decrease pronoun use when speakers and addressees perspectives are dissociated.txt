   To tease these possible effects of cognitive load apart, the
linguistic salience of the referent should be varied, because
the effect of cognitive load might be different for salient and
non-salient referents. In addition, to determine whether
cognitive load affects the speaker’s discourse model or the
speaker’s assumptions about the addressee’s discourse
model, the speaker’s and addressee’s perspectives should be
dissociated. Therefore, we conducted a story completion
experiment in which we manipulated perspective, referent
salience and cognitive load. Perspective was manipulated by
presenting one of the sentences of the story only to the
speaker, over headphones (cf. Fukumura and Van Gompel,
2012). The referent was considered linguistically salient for
the speaker when it was mentioned in this privileged
sentence, and not salient when it was only mentioned in the
introductory sentence. Since the addressee did not hear the
privileged sentence, referent salience was reversed for the
addressee. Cognitive load was manipulated by giving the
speaker a second, unrelated (but also verbal) task in the first
or the second half of the experiment.
   We hypothesized that if cognitive load lowers the
accessibility of referents in the speaker’s discourse model, it
should decrease pronoun use, irrespective of the referent’s
linguistic salience. If, on the other hand, cognitive load
makes perspective taking more difficult, there should be a
stronger tendency to use the speaker’s own discourse model
in the dual task condition. That is, speakers should be more
likely to use pronouns when the referent is salient in their
own discourse model (and not in their addressee’s), than
when the referent is salient in the addressee’s discourse
model (and not salient in their own). Alternatively, speakers
may tend to use more pronouns in general when under
increased cognitive load.
