   with a shared-variance half-life of over 100 trials (∼ 10 min).
   We thus propose a model that treats the word-to-magnitude
   mapping function as a major source of estimation variability,
   and that accounts for cross-subject differences in estimation
   bias and variability, as well as changes to estimation perfor-
   mance within a given subject over time. In doing so, we rec-
   oncile the existing literature on the sources of estimation vari-
   ability, and provide evidence that uncertainty in the word-to-
   magnitude mapping function is a key limiting factor in estima-
   tion performance.

                           Introduction
Human adults have access to at least two systems for repre-
senting numerical quantity. The first is a noisy and evolution-
arily ancient nonverbal number system, called the Approxi-
mate Number System (ANS; see Dehaene, 1997; Feigenson,
Dehaene, & Spelke, 2004 for review). The second is the ver-
bal number word system (e.g., one, two, three, etc.). This
system unique to humans allows for the precise represen-
tation and manipulation of numerical content. When mak-
ing estimates, adults draw on both of these systems: they use
the ANS to represent the magnitude of the stimulus being es-
timated, and they use the verbal number system to attach a
linguistic label to this magnitude.
   The interface between these two systems has been an area
of recent interest because it is crucial to characterizing how
people can provide explicit verbal estimates of numerosity,              Figure 1: (Top) Our account of the bias and variability in human nu-

   Scalar variability is thought to arise from Weber noise
                                                                       errors in estimation performance, with a special focus on the
in the ANS: ANS representations are ratio-dependent, and
                                                                       variability and bias found in individual participants estimates.
therefore error in its representation of number also scales with
number. For example, it is as easy to tell the difference be-
tween 5 dots and 10 dots as it is to tell the difference between
500 dots and 1000 dots using the ANS. Because both nonver-
bal ANS tasks and verbal estimation tasks exhibit scalar vari-
ability, many have concluded that scalar variability in estima-
tion arises because the underlying (ANS) perceptual repre-
sentations of the magnitudes being estimated exhibits weber
noise (Dehaene & Marques, 2002; Izard & Dehaene, 2008;
Le Corre & Carey, 2007; Negen & Sarnecka, 2010; Siegler &
Opfer, 2003) and relatively uncontroversial.
   It is clear from the past literature that much of the variabil-
ity found in estimation arises from variability in the ANS rep-
resentations that support estimates. However, in the present
paper, we ask whether all of the variability in estimation
performance is explained by Weber noise, or, alternatively,
whether the mapping function that connects the verbal and
nonverbal number system also contributes variability to es-
timation performance. One reason to believe that variability
and bias may arise in part from the mapping function between
number language and the ANS is that feedback (e.g., show-
ing a participant an example) reduces estimation variability
in both children and adults (Barth, Starr, & Sullivan, 2009;
Krueger, 1984; Izard & Dehaene, 2008; Lipton & Spelke,
2005) a finding that one might not expect if variability arose
entirely from the ANS. A second reason to believe that esti-
mation variability stems entirely from the ANS is that some-           Figure 2: (Top) Participants saw 300 trials in which an array of n

                             Results
The responses of all 24 participants for all 300 trials in our ex-
periment are shown in Figure 3 on log-log coordinates. Sev-
eral features of the data immediately jump out. First, esti-
mate variability goes up as a function of number. Since this
is an increase in variability in log-log space, it is not consis-
tent with a constant coefficient of variation (a constant Weber
fraction) which predicts that variability would be constant in
log-log space. Second, while subjects are well calibrated for
small numbers, there is a tendency to underestimate for large
numbers: most subjects underestimated, but some subjects
showed fairly reliable overestimation or veridical average cal-
ibration. Third, individual differences in under- or over- esti-

z = −2.74, p = 0.0061).
   The difference between Modular and Blocked split-half re-
liability is our first indication that the slope of the magnitude-
number mapping function is not stable within individuals
over the experimental session: If the slopes we estimate for
the mapping function drift over time, we expect that Blocked
splits should yield a lower split-half across-subject reliabil-
ity than Modular splits, because the Blocked splits are taken
from different points in time, and would reflect different
states of drift of the mapping function, while Modular splits
would not.
Does the mapping function vary over time?
We argue that some of the increase in variability of estimates
with increasing number arises from variability of the mapping
function over trials, rather than simple misperception of the
approximate magnitude of an individual array. In this section
we argue for this view because the internal mapping function
drifts slowly over the course of many trials, and we can mea-          Figure 5: (Top) We can assess the average across-subject correla-
