of simultaneous activation over units (analogous to groups
of neurons) that represent the semantic features of the item
being encoded.
   DORA learns structured representations of properties
shared between objects by comparing them. Features shared
between objects receive input from multiple sources and are
isolated via simple Hebbian learning. The resulting
representations are comprised of these shared features, are
independent of any specific objects, and can be bound to
novel objects encountered in the future. 3 When DORA
compares instances of objects searching for another (e.g., a
cat searching for a mouse and a sister searching for her
brother) it learns representations of searcher (comparing the
cat and sister) and sought (comparing the mouse and the
brother). When observing a new instance of searching the

3 DORA binds representations of roles to fillers (e.g., objects) dynamically (i.e., the binding of a role to a filler is temporary so that the
same role can be bound to different fillers in different contexts) via systematic asynchrony of firing (Doumas et al., 2008). In asynchrony-
based binding, roles are bound to their fillers by proximity of firing, with bound roles and fillers firing in direct sequence. For example, to
bind searcher to cat, and sought to mouse, the units coding the searcher role fire, followed by the units coding cat. Next, the units coding
