that visual motion activates motion-responsive areas in the
brain (MT +). However, this activation can be suppressed
by top-down control mechanisms in the case of above-
threshold motion coherence only. Thus, only in near-
threshold motion patterns the motion information resulted in
interactions with semantic language processing. In contrast,
in the case of above-threshold visual motion pattern top-
down control was recruited and suppressed this visual
activation. Importantly, in the study by Meteyard et al. the

it remains open whether above-threshold visual motion can
