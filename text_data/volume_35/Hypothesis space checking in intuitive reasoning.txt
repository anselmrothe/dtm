  Although our participants compared hypotheses in the
sense that they reported whether the Chaotics or
Numerologists occupied an island, it seems difficult to
explain their inferences as the product of what we have
called comparative hypothesis testing. Consider, for
example, the difficulties that arise in explaining the culture
ratings by appealing to Equation 1, which in the context of
