   Recent evidence has suggested that the relationship be-
   tween a test of fluid intelligence, Raven’s Progressive
   Matrices, and working memory capacity (WMC) may
   be invariant across difficulty levels of the Raven’s items.
   We show that this invariance can only be observed if
   the overall correlation between Raven’s and WMC is
   low. We demonstrate that by using a composite mea-
   sure of WMC, which yields a higher correlation between                1      2     3     4         1      2      3     4
