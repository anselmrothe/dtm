   Our primary research question dealt with how people
would combine the two halves of a face and when they
might show something akin to the dilution effect. To
address this question we compared accuracy with each
whole face to that with the stronger half alone. Deviation
scores were calculated within individuals by subtracting the
mean accuracy given the stronger half face from the
response (coded as correct or incorrect) given for whole
face. A value greater than 0 indicates additive integration,        Figure 4: Predicted deviation scores for the McIA model.
