and, separately, the speed time series of each dyad (see
Figure 2 for the analysis steps). A CRQ analysis is
conducted by first embedding the pair of normalized time
series in a multidimensional, time-delayed phase space (see
Marwan, Romano, Thiel & Kurths, 2007; Ramenzoni et al.,
2012; Richardson, Schmidt, & Kay, 2007; Shockley et al.,
2002; Webber & Zbilut, 1994). Because not all variables
that make up the behavior in a dynamical system are
necessarily knowable a priori, phase space reconstruction
allows for the behavior of these potentially “hidden”
variables in the dynamical system to be evaluated via their
interaction with, or influence on, the known variable (in this
case the s time series). Thus, the structure of the
reconstructed phase space can reveal the underlying
dynamics of the dynamical system as a whole. Specifically,
the “neighborliness” of points within some tolerance or
radius in phase space can indicate recurrent points in the
two time series. These represent states in one time series
that closely correspond to previous or future states in the
other time series, and can illustrate behavioral patterns of
coordination in the observed system. The recurrent points
are identified and represented in a cross-recurrence plot (see
Figure 2, bottom), from which a suite of measures can then
be computed to quantify these patterns (see Shockley et al.,
                                                                     Figure 2: A schematic of the steps in the CRQ analysis. For

Follow-up t-tests (Bonferroni corrected p ≤ .01) indicated
that the s variable was more strongly correlated with PC1 in
the real groups than in the virtual groups (all p < .001),
whereas the ϕ variable was not (all p > .01), for all four
agent positions. Within the real groups, the s variable was
more strongly correlated with PC1 than the ϕ variable (p <
.001), whereas s and ϕ did not significantly differ in the
virtual groups (all p > .01), for all agent positions. Thus, the
behavior of real groups was more coherent than that of
virtual groups, primarily due to the coordination of walking
speed; thanks to the presence of a common goal, heading
was independently aligned in both groups.
