Abstract
Related languages, like English and Spanish, often have similar orthographies but use the same letters to represent different sounds. Learning a second language frequently involves
learning additional letter-sound mappings that mismatch those
in the native language. In the current study, we investigated
whether L2 spoken words activate L2 orthography despite conflict with L1 orthography-to-phonology mappings. Participants first learned an artificial language with letter-sound mappings that mismatched English (e.g., the letter ‘G’ represented
the sound /h/, and the word /gufO/ was spelled ‘hane’). Next,
fixations of L1 crosslinguistic orthographic competitors (e.g.,
‘cane’) in response to auditory L2 input (e.g., /gufO/) were
assessed using the visual world paradigm. Results showed
that participants fixated L1 competitors that overlapped with
L2 targets orthographically (but not phonologically) more than
unrelated fillers. We conclude that second language learners
can rapidly acquire novel letter-sound mappings, and words
based on these mappings are integrated into the existing lexicon where they can activate orthographic competitors in the
native language.

Introduction
Spoken language processing involves decoding an incoming
auditory signal to access words in the mental lexicon. It’s
not obvious that this process should be affected by orthographic knowledge, because written language is a relatively
recent invention, and is learned years after spoken language.
Yet, there is evidence that orthography, once acquired, influences performance on phonological tasks (Jakimik, Cole, &
Rudnicky, 1985; Johnston, McKague, & Pratt, 2004; Salverda
& Tanenhaus, 2010), suggesting tight interconnectivity between orthography and phonology. This interconnectivity
may be a source of difficulty during second language acquisition, because the same letters can represent different sounds
across languages. For example, the letter ‘W’ maps onto the
phoneme /w/ in English, but /v/ in German (one is a labiovelar approximant, while the other is a voiced labio-dental
fricative, which differs on both voicing, place, and manner
of articulation). Second language learners thus need to learn
and use these novel letter-sound correspondences in the appropriate language context, despite years of experience with
a different set of mappings in their native language.
Orthographic knowledge can help or hinder phonological
processing, depending on the context. Literate adults perform better than illiterate adults on metaphonological tasks

such as adding or deleting sounds at the beginning of nonwords (Morais, Cary, Alegria, & Bertelson, 1979), because
literate adults can use their orthographic representations as
a mental aid. On the other hand, orthography can also distort phonological perception. French speakers are more likely
to misperceive the phoneme /p/ as a /b/ in spoken words
when the sound is represented by the letter ‘B’, as in the
French word ‘absurd,’ pronounced /apsyrd/ (Hallé, Chéreau,
& Segui, 2000). Furthermore, orthography can affect online
processing of speech. Orthographically-related primes improve auditory lexical decision times (Jakimik et al., 1985),
but written words can act as competitors during auditory visual world search tasks (Salverda & Tanenhaus, 2010). Based
on timecourse analyses from research on event-related potentials (ERPs), these orthographic effects occur early in the
speech signal and are time-locked to the source of orthographic effects in the word, suggesting that orthography is
activated online during speech processing, and not strictly as
a postlexical decision process (Perre & Ziegler, 2008).
The link between orthography and phonology extends to
novel words as well. In a recent study (Johnston et al.,
2004), monolingual English speakers were taught a series of
novel words but only learned the words’ phonological forms,
and were never presented with orthography. During a subsequent masked priming task, orthographic versions of the
trained words showed a significant priming effect, compared
to the absence of any effect for completely novel written nonwords. This finding suggests that learners automatically generate orthographic forms for novel auditory words, based on
the phonotactics of their native language. When these generated forms are accurate, they can accelerate vocabulary learning and improve reading of previously learned auditory words
(McKague, Pratt, & Johnston, 2001). During second language
learning, though, they are more likely to be inaccurate and
impair learning. For example, an English-speaking learner of
German may hear the auditory German word /vEk/ (spelled
‘weg’) and create an incorrect orthographic representation
‘veck’ based on their knowledge of English. This incorrect
representation may then impair learning to read and write in
German, as the learner’s internal representations must be inhibited and relearned. Previous work indicates that English
speakers are able to learn words and letter-sound mappings
in artificial languages with training, even when they include

1827

non-English phonemes (Kaushanskaya & Marian, 2009a),
graphemes (Bitan & Karni, 2003), or a combination of the
two (Kaushanskaya & Marian, 2008). In the current study,
we isolated acquisition of novel letter-sound mappings by recombining familiar English letters and sounds. Even when
there are no new letters or sounds to be learned, acquiring
novel mappings can be difficult – for example, two of the
most challenging letters for English learners of Russian to
learn are B (pronounced /v/), and Y (pronounced /u/), which
are often mispronounced as /b/ and /i/ respectively, representing interference from existing English mappings (Comer &
Murphy-Lee, 2004). Full language acquisition requires learners to form new mappings between orthography and phonology that are appropriate for the target language, and to be able
to inhibit their native language mappings during L2 processing.
In sum, there is a tight interconnectivity between orthography and phonology, but letter-sound mappings often conflict
across languages, which may lead to second language learning difficulties. The current study was designed to investigate how learners manage these difficulties. The first goal
of the study was to assess how well learners are able to acquire vocabulary in a novel language with letter-sound correspondences that mismatch English. The second goal was
to determine whether auditory words in the L2 will activate
L2 orthography, based on spreading activation from the L2 to
words that resemble the L2 orthographic form. These questions are addressed by teaching participants a L2 vocabulary
with letter-sound correspondences completely distinct from
English. If participants are able to learn the novel orthophono mappings, then presentation of the auditory form of
the word will lead to activation of the corresponding orthographic form. In a connectionist model of language processing, activation should then spread to similarly spelled words
in the lexicon.
Because the novel language and English have different
letter-sound mappings, auditory targets in the new language
do not overlap phonologically with their English orthographic
competitors (e.g., the novel word /gufO/, spelled ‘hane’, overlaps orthographically but not phonologically with the English word ‘cane’). If participants look at crosslinguistic orthographic competitors upon hearing L2 words, they must
have activated the target’s L2 orthographic form, which then
spread activation to orthographically related items, including the crosslinguistic competitor. The current study thus allows us to simultaneously assess the effects of novel orthophono mappings and cross-linguistic interference on speech
processing in a newly learned language.

Methods
Participants
Twenty monolingual English speakers (16 females, 4 males)
participated. Eyetracking data was unavailable for one participant due to equipment error. All participants reported current
English use at 99% of the time or more, and a proficiency

of three or less on a scale of 1 (no knowledge) to 10 (perfect) in a second language (LEAP-Q, Marian, Blumenfeld, &
Kaushanskaya, 2007).

Materials
A miniature artificial language named Colbertian1 was created using a novel alphabetic system. Thirteen English
graphemes (four vowels and nine consonants) were paired
with thirteen English phonemes so that the English and Colbertian sounds for each letter differed maximally in voice,
place, and manner for consonants, or height, backness, and
rounding for vowels (Table 1). Reusing English phonemes
ensured that participants needed only to learn the novel lettersound correspondences, but not any new phonetic categories.

Twenty-four words were then created using the Colbertian alphabet (Table 2). Each word was recorded by a female speaker of Standard American English, and was associated with an easily-nameable black and white line drawing (naming consistency higher than 80% from the International Picture Naming Project database, Bates et al., 2003,
or norming with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk). Each of the
novel words was designed to overlap orthographically, but
not phonologically, with an English competitor word in order to isolate the effect of English orthographic knowledge
on Colbertian auditory word processing. Target words, competitor words, and filler words were matched on the following variables: phonological neighborhood size (IPhOD;
Vaden, Halpin, & Hickok, 2009), orthographic neighborhood size (N-Watch; Davis, 2005), English lexical frequency
(SUBTLEX-US; Brysbaert & New, 2009), concreteness, imageability, or familiarity (MRC Psycholinguistic Database;
Coltheart, 1981), all p’s > 0.05.
1 The language was named after comedy show wordsmith and
Northwestern University alumnus Stephen Colbert to engage participants in the learning task.

Procedure
Participants learned Colbertian in a single experimental session in four steps. In the first step, participants were exposed
to each of the Colbertian words’ spellings and pronunciations.
A single written word appeared in the center of a computer
screen, and the auditory form of the word was pronounced
over headphones. The participant repeated the word aloud
and clicked the mouse to advance to the next word. Each
word was presented once, for a total of 24 exposures. In the
second step, participants practiced associating the words and
their pronunciations until they reached a 90% learning criterion. In a single trial, four Colbertian words were shown
on the screen, and the auditory form of the target word was
played over headphones. After selecting one of the four
words, participants received feedback: the target word turned
green, the three foils disappeared, and the word was replayed
over headphones. This ensured that participants had an opportunity to relearn the words they answered incorrectly. After 24 trials, with each word as a target once, the participant
was shown their accuracy for the block. Each participant repeated blocks of 24 trials until they reached 90% accuracy on
two consecutive blocks.
In the third step, participants were familarized with the
meanings of the words they had just learned. Four pictures
appeared on the screen, and after 1500 ms, a Colbertian word

appeared on the center of the screen and was played over
headphones, and the picture it represented was outlined with
a red box (nontarget pictures remained visible)2 . In the fourth
step, participants practiced associating Colbertian words with
their pictures until achieving the 90% learning criterion. In
each trial, four pictures were displayed on the screen, and
the target word was simultaneously presented in written and
auditory forms. After selecting a picture, feedback was provided: the target picture was outlined in a red box (nontarget
pictures remained visible) and the target word was replayed
over headphones. Each trial, including response time and
feedback, lasted exactly six seconds to equate picture viewing times across trials. After 24 trials, with each word as a
target once, the participant was shown their accuracy for the
block. Participants continued doing training blocks until they
reached 90% accuracy on two consecutive blocks, at which
point they were finished learning Colbertian.
After learning Colbertian, participants immediately began
a visual world eyetracking task to assess the effect of English
orthographic knowledge on Colbertian spoken word processing. Each trial began with a 1000 ms fixation cross to orient participants’ gaze. Next, the cross disappeared and four
pictures appeared in the corners of the screen. After a 500
ms delay, a Colbertian word indicating the target picture was
played over headphones (the orthographic form of the target
was never shown). The participant’s task was to click on the
target picture as quickly and accurately as possible. No feedback was provided. Trial presentation was controlled by the
experimental software (MATLAB with Psychophysics toolbox), and monocular eye gaze was recorded with an SR Eyelink 1000 eyetracker at 1000 Hz in order to assess changes in
activation of pictured referents over time. In 24 Experimental trials, the English name of one of the three filler pictures
overlapped orthographically (but not phonologically) with the
orthographic form of the Colbertian target word in three out
of four letters (Targets and Competitors are shown in Table
2). Twenty-four Filler trials, in which none of the pictures
overlapped orthographically or phonologically with the Colbertian target, were included to mask the experimental manipulation.
Finally, participants’ knowledge of Colbertian’s lettersound correspondences was assessed with a novel word generalization task. In each of 48 trials, four novel Colbertian
words, one target and three foils, were presented in the four
corners of the screen, and the novel auditory form of the target
was played over headphones. The participant selected a word
and the next trial began after an inter-trial interval of 1500
ms. Accuracy and response time were recorded, but no feedback was provided. Twenty-four of the trials constituted the
Simple Discrimination condition, in which none of the foils
used any of the target word’s letters in the same position (e.g.,
Target /suzO/ spelled ‘bape’ and Foils ‘kovi’, ‘vedo’, ‘rina’).
2 To

control for picture familiarity, targets, competitors, and
fillers from the visual world task were viewed equally during training. Competitors never appeared with the overlapping Colbertian
targets.

1829

Cross-Linguistic Orthographic Interference

As such, knowing only one of the letters in Colbertian was
sufficient to identify the target. The other 24 trials constituted the Hard Discrimination condition, where one foil overlapped the target in the first consonant, another overlapped in
the second consonant, and the third overlapped in both vowels (e.g., Target /wOtSæ/ spelled ‘kedi’, with C1 Foil ‘kova’,
C2 Foil ‘nado’, Vowel Foil ‘beri’). Thus, a correct response
required additional knowledge of the target beyond a single
letter-sound mapping. Simple and Hard Discrimination trials
were presented in an intermixed fashion.

Proportion of Looks Visual fixations lasting at least 200
ms were analyzed (shorter fixations are mostly parts of a preplanned path for rapidly analyzing a newly-presented scene,
since eye-movements in visual world tasks take about 200 ms
to plan and execute, Viviani, 1990) from auditory target onset
to 1600 ms post-target onset, at which point visual fixations
reached an asymptote. The proportion of looks to English orthographic competitors was compared to the average of both
fillers present on the same display in a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Participants looked more often at the orthographic competitor pictures than filler pictures, F 1 (1, 17) =
17.09, p < 0.001, F 2 (1, 23) = 3.98, p = 0.05 (Figure 1).

Results
Learning
Participants reached the 90% criterion for whole word learning after M = 10.10 blocks (SD = 7.40, Range [2, 31]).
For learning the semantic meaning of the words, participants
reached the 90% criterion after only M = 3.05 blocks (SD =
0.69, Range [2, 4]).
Participants demonstrated high competence with Colbertian orthography on the generalization task. Accuracy was
92% (SD = 8) in the Simple Discrimination condition, and
75% (SD = 19) in the Hard Discrimination condition (significantly lower, t(19) = 4.55, p < 0.001). Consistent with accuracy, RTs were significantly faster in Simple Discrimination,
M = 3.56 seconds (SD = 0.86), compared to Hard Discrimination, M = 4.20 seconds (SD = 1.39), t(19) = 3.04, p < 0.01.
Though the training paradigm equated participants on Colbertian proficiency, learning rate was associated with Colbertian generalization skill. Faster learning rate in wholeword training blocks was associated with increased accuracy
in Simple Discrimination, R2 = -0.23, p < 0.05, and highly
associated with increased accuracy in Hard Discrimination,
R2 = -0.49, p < 0.001. Faster learning rate was also associated with longer RTs in Hard Discrimination, R2 = -0.27, p <
0.05, but not in Simple Discrimination, R2 = -0.03, ns.

Fixation Timecourse Proportion of looks to Competitors
versus Fillers were analyzed with point-to-point t-tests in 100
ms time bins from -500 ms pre-word-onset to 2000 ms postword onset (Figure 2). Participants looked more often at orthographic Competitors than Fillers from 0-100 ms and from
100-200 ms post-word onset (p’s < 0.05 corrected).

In this experiment, we examined the role of orthography on
novel language learning and auditory processing. We found
that participants were successfully able to learn a novel language containing letter-sound mappings that contrasted with
English. Learners successfully generalized their knowledge
to novel, untrained words, suggesting that they acquired Colbertian’s phonetic rules and did not rely on whole-word learning alone. In fact, faster learners were also better at identifying novel words; it may be that these participants were able to

1830

extract and make use of Colbertian’s letter-sound mappings
early in their training, which accelerated their learning. In
contrast, those who struggled to learn the novel words appeared to have learned less about specific ortho-phono mappings, and performed more poorly identifying novel words.
Auditory presentation of learned words activated their corresponding orthographic forms, as evidenced by more frequent visual fixations to cross-linguistic English orthographic
competitors from 0-200 ms post target word onset. The early
timecourse of the effect suggests that orthography affected
speech processing online rather than at a post-lexical decision level, a finding that converges with evidence from ERPs
(Perre & Ziegler, 2008). Note that because of the contrasting letter-sound mappings between English and Colbertian,
competitor items did not overlap with the target phonologically. By design, this rules out phonological competition,
providing strong evidence for automatic activation of crosslinguistic orthographic competitors during spoken word processing. Overall, our findings indicate that not only were participants able to activate orthographic forms of novel words
despite conflict with existing letter-sound mappings in their
native language, but these words were also able to spread
activation to similarly spelled words in the native language,
suggesting some integration with the existing lexicon.
These findings suggest that when people hear words in one
language, not only do they experience activation of the letters
in that language, but that they also experience activation of
words in other languages they know or are learning that are
spelled similarly. In other words, when an English learner of
German hears a German word that is pronounced /za:g@/ and
is spelled ‘sage’, (conjugation of the verb ‘sagen,’ meaning
‘to say’), the English word ‘sage’ (pronounced /seIdZ/) becomes activated due to its overlapping orthography, despite
having minimal phonological overlap with the actual auditory
input. This spreading co-activation of phonology and orthography across languages testifies to the highly interactive and
dynamic nature of the human language system.
In the present study, since all the phonemes of the novel
language also exist in English, we would expect English orthographic mappings to be more easily accessible based on
their greater frequency of use. However, participants were
able to activate the novel language’s orthographic forms,
which suggests that the language system may contain a mechanism to increase activation of newly-learned letter-sound
mappings, enabling them to match or exceed mappings in the
native language. Although we did find that participants activated orthographic forms of spoken words using L2 lettersound mappings (e.g., ‘hane’ for the spoken word /gufO/),
it’s unclear whether an orthographic form based on L1 lettersound mappings, such as ‘goofaw’ was also activated. The
current study was unable to probe for this kind of L1 activation, given that an orthographic competitor, like the word
‘goofy,’ would also overlap with the target phonologically,
obscuring orthographic effects. Overall, it’s unlikely that the
native language was completely suppressed during the task,

given that we saw fixations to competitors in the visual display based on L1 lexical knowledge, which suggests that both
the novel language and the native language remained active to
some degree.
The present results indicate that orthographic information
plays an important role during second language learning and
auditory word processing. Future work should investigate
how different types of language experience affect learning
and processing of a novel orthography. The English monolinguals in the current study had moderate experience with
contrasting letter-sound mappings (e.g., the phoneme /s/ can
be represented by either ‘S’ or ‘C’), compared to speakers of
a transparent language (low experience) or bilinguals (high
experience). Transparent languages with nearly one-to-one
mappings between orthography and phonology, like Italian
and Finnish, may not prepare speakers well for acquisition
of contrasting mappings in a novel language, resulting in
more cross-linguistic interference. On the other hand, bilinguals should acquire novel mappings faster and exhibit less
interference compared to English monolinguals, since bilinguals already have experience with two sets of letter-sound
correspondences. Indeed, bilinguals learn novel languages
better than monolinguals (Cenoz, 2003; Cenoz & Valencia,
1994; Kaushanskaya & Marian, 2009a, 2009b; Sanz, 2000;
Thomas, 1992; Van Hell & Mahn, 1997) and can control
phonological competition more efficiently (Bartolotti & Marian, 2012), and it’s likely that these advantages will extend to
acquisition of a novel orthography. In sum, language perception and learning can be shaped by existing language knowledge across modalities, which emphasizes the highly interactive nature of the language system.
In conclusion, our results show that orthography can be
activated online during auditory word processing, and furthermore, that the individual links between letters and sounds
can be updated as part of learning a second language. Acquiring the orthographic and phonological systems of a new
language is an important step in achieving proficiency. Identifying both how previous experience with language may affect acquisition of novel letter-sound correspondences, and
the rate at which novel words become integrated in the lexicon, will help uncover the essential components to successful
language learning.
