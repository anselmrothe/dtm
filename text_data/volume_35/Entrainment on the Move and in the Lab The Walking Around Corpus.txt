distribute the responsibility for grounding utterances (see
Brennan, 2004 for discussion).
   The amount of visual context provided to the stationary
direction-giving partner during the navigational task was
varied as a between-pairs and within-destinations factor. For
half of the target destinations, the direction-giver saw only a
close-up photo of the target (Figure 1) along with its
numbered location on a map; for the other half, they saw the
close-ups plus extra visual context (Figure 2). Each pair was
assigned to either List 1 or List 2, with Givers seeing
minimally illustrated targets in List 1 or extra visual context
in List 2, and vice versa.
   Because the mobile partner in the navigation task had rich
visual information from being present within the local
context, while the stationary partner had global information
about the target location but less information about its visual
appearance and relative local landmarks, we predicted that
additional visual context for the stationary partner would
help them align their knowledge, making presentation and
acceptance phases of the directions more efficient jointly.
On the other hand, such knowledge might be unnecessary
for direction-givers who knew campus well (assessed during
the final questionnaire).                                               Figure 1: Close-up views of 10 targets seen by Givers
