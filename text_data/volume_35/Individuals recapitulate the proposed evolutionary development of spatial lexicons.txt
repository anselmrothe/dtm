human cognition.
    One means of pursuing this question concerns language
change. One may observe or infer general patterns in the
ways languages evolve over historical time, and ask whether
these patterns of change, based on observation across
languages and across time, are also evident at a given
moment in the minds of individuals who speak a single
language.
    Such a demonstration has already been made in the
semantic domain of color (Boster, 1986), and here we
present an analogous demonstration in the semantic domain
of spatial relations. In what follows, we first describe the                  Figure 1: Kay and McDaniel’s (1978) proposed

by the standard deviation of the original values in that

      The two alternative versions of the model that we considered
differ in whether more specific ON or UNDER categories form first.
In addition to these two alternatives, the model also varies in
whether OVER or NEAR categories are distinguished earlier.
However, these distinctions are made with respect to the category
AT, which is not included in our analysis because as a residual
category, it does not appear to have a meaningful cross-linguistic
focus. Thus, the NEAR/ AT distinction is not available to our
participants, which in turn prevents variability in whether OVER or
NEAR is distinguished first.
