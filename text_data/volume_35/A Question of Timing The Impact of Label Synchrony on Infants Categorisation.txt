paradigms, novelty preference for the out-of-category object
has been established as an indicator of category formation.
However, the two out-of-category items occurring in the first
two test trials were constructed by replacing just one of the
two parts (shell or leaf) with an item that differed from the
familiarisation exemplars. We were therefore able to track on
a very fine-grained, almost featural, level whether infants re-
sponded to novelty. Our hypothesis was that if infants were
able to learn the category in silence, but labels (asynchronous
or synchronous) interfered with learning, then infants should                        Figure 2: Test objects 1, 2 and 3.
