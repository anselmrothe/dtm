   Two experiments investigated the production and comprehen-
   sion of referring expressions that contain a negative property
   (”the marker without a cap”). Experiment 1 showed that par-
   ticipants do use negative properties in their object descriptions,
   but that they were almost always accompanied by other prop-
   erties, leading to referential overspecification. In experiment 2,
   participants identified objects based on descriptions that con-
   tained negative properties. While participants were faster in
   identifying objects that were described with preferred proper-
   ties such as color, response times for objects described with a
   negative property (”the marker without a cap”) and a positive
   property (”the marker with a cap”) did not differ. The results
   provide behavioral grounds for extending referring expression             Figure 1: The two markers on the desk of your colleague.

For Experiment 2, the visual materials used in Experiment 1
were stripped from the black rectangle and were presented in
the upper left, middle and upper right corner of the screen (see
figure 6). They were complemented with a start box at the
bottom of the screen. In addition, we recorded instructions to
indicate the target object that contained five different ways
to refer to the target. These referential expressions either
used a positive property (“click on the marker with a cap”),
a negative property (“click on the marker without a cap”),
color or size (“click on the yellow marker”), color and size
(“click on the large yellow marker”), and type-identifiable

were minimally specifying in that they provided sufficient,
but not more, information to identify the target object. The
