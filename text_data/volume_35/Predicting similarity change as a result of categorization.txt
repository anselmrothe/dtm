   Research on the influence of categorization on perception        Three different hypotheses regarding the effect of category

encoding of the exemplars may mean that exemplar
representations end up being developed in a way that is
more consistent with the underlying category structure (e.g.,
Edwards, Pothos, & Perlman, in press). Support for this
prediction comes from Folstein, Gauthier, and Palmeri
(2010), who manipulated the complexity of the underlying
stimulus space (not of category structure, as in the current
study). Unlike previous related evidence showing that
categorization does not influence similarity (e.g., Jiang et
al., 2007; Freedman et al., 2003), they showed significant
effects of categorization on perception, when the underlying
stimulus space was simple.
  The converse prediction, regarding the effect of category
learning difficulty on similarity changes, is that learning a
difficult category structure might result in more significant
and enduring changes in the similarity structure of the
stimuli. This possibility is motivated by evidence showing
that supervised categorization processes can involve
processes of selective attention or other changes in
psychological space (e.g., through the sensitivity parameter;
Nosofsky, 1984), though such research does not tell us
whether such changes are enduring and on the actual
stimulus representations.
  A second hypothesis is that the linear separability of the
learned categories might moderate changes in similarity.
Overall, there is quite a lot of controversy regarding the role
of linear separability in category learning and perhaps some       Figure 1. The six category structures employed in the study.
