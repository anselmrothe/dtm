representation of the object after the change.
Current experiments
In the current study, we tested for location-based and object-
based competition effects in sentence processing. In two
experiments, we addressed a critical difference between
Altmann and Kamide (2009) and Hoover and Richardson
(2008): the predictability of the context-relevant location
information. In Altmann and Kamide, the discourse contexts
were highly predictable (e.g., the discourse-final “the glass”
could be anticipated based on the verb selectional
restrictions of “pour”), and consequently they observed                Figure 1: Example visual array from Experiments 1 and 2.
