quantities of an effect in the presence vs. absence of the
cause (see Table 1).
   The generative experiment used a cover story that asked
participants to imagine they were pharmaceutical
consultants researching the side effects (skin rash) of
synthetic substances in cosmetic creams. Fifteen different
fictitious cosmetic creams corresponded to the 15 causal
conditions in Table 1.
   The cover story also described that the size of skin rash
was measured before and after the application of the cream,
and that some patients may develop skin rash even in the
absence of any cosmetic products. Instructions stressed that
each cream was applied to cover 10 cm2 of a patient’s back
and that the base rate (rash before cream application) was
also expressed with reference to this 10 cm2 area. This
served to impose an artificial limit of maximum causal
efficacy – the cream could only create rash so as to cover
the entire 10 cm2 area.
