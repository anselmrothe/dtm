In a recent paper, Laszlo & Plaut (2012) proposed a way to
capture N400 ERP word reading data in a parallel
distributed processing (PDP) connectionist network whose
architecture was based on two neurally plausible
characteristics: neurons can either be excitatory or
inhibitory, but not both, and inhibitory connections can only
occur within layers, but not between (as the range of
inhibitory connections in the brain is shorter than that of
excitatory connections). Given these two constraints, the
model generated cycle-based time-course data that reflected
the temporal evolution of the N400 response, replicating the
“orthographic neighborhood size” effect that words with
larger orthographic neighborhood size elicit larger N400s
compared to words with smaller neighborhood size.
However, it is currently unclear whether this model would
also capture various other known N400 word effects such as
those obtained in the context of bilingual word processing.
   In this paper, we propose a PDP architecture for a PDP
model of bilingual word processing, which can successfully
capture several known N400 effects in early bilingual word
