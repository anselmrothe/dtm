    Modeling Testimony Across Task Domains
In order to rationally learn from others’ testimony, children
must consider several types of information: the testimonies
themselves, their own observations, and social and
pragmatic cues that can affect the interpretation of others’
testimony. The specific cues and information available to
children vary depending on domain, leading them to rely
more heavily on pure testimony in some domains. Learning
object labels is a task that is especially dependent on social
conventions. Speakers of a language must implicitly agree
that certain words refer to specific objects, concepts, or               Figure 1: Dependencies of the variables in our Bayesian
