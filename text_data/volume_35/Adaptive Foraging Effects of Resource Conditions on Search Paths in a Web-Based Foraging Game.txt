made the game web-based to collect data from large
numbers of participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.
Recent studies show that Turk yields data comparable to
university participant pools (Germine et al., 2012; Snow,
O’Connor, Jurafsky, & Ng, 2008), and we confirmed this in
a pilot study run through the UC Merced participant pool
(not reported). Turk allowed us to robustly sample the
parameter space created by factorial manipulation of
sparsity and clustering. Turk also allowed us to collect
enough data to compare players who find greater versus
fewer numbers of targets, i.e. high versus low performers.
   Comparisons of high versus low scorers are critical
because they test whether adaptive search is associated with
closer-to-optimal (i.e. higher scoring) performance. That is,
do high performers adapt their search strategies, as
measured by path length distributions, to changes in sparsity
and clustering? Do high scoring foraging paths more closely
resemble Lévy flights with the theoretically optimal
exponent of two? Addressing these questions will provide
evidence on 1) whether Lévy-like foraging paths can
emerge from searcher-environment interactions on
timescales no longer than minutes, and 2) whether adapting
paths to sparsity or clustering is associated with better
performance.
