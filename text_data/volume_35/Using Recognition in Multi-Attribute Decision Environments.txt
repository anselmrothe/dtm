troduction, our key focus is on investigating pure recognition
without associated knowledge of the response options and
thus we effectively disabled internal memory–based search
by concealing the names of each city. In order to aid the
decision making process, participants were presented with a
number of cues on screen for which they can retrieve infor-

cess was the recognition cue of which data was provided in
the first stage of the experiment. A screenshot of the second
stage of the experiment is provided in Figure 1.
   The final manipulation in our experiment consisted of the
availability of information on two key aspects of each cue.
These are each cues’ validity and discriminability. The valid-
ity of a cue quantifies the number of times a cue points you
to the right answer as a ratio of the times it discriminates be-
tween the two response options. For instance, in the Italian               Figure 1: Screenshot of a trial of the binary version of the US
