numbers were controlled to be the same. Experiments from
a past study showed that participants are fixated to the figure
perspective, and participants try to search for the target rule
based on his/her perspective (Hayashi et al., 2006; Hayashi
& Miwa, 2009; Hayashi, 2012) . On trial 9, we controlled
the trials for differentiation in responses so that participants
would report different numbers. Through this manipulation,                                            Server
participants experience conflict.
