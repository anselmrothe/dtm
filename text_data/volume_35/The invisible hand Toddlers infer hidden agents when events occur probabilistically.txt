                          Methods
Participants
Sixty-four toddlers (mean age: 17.2 months; range: 12.0 to
23.5 months) were recruited at a Children’s Museum. We
tested both younger (12-17 months) and older (18-24
months) toddlers. There were 16 toddlers in each condition
(age group × evidence conditions). An additional 23
toddlers were recruited but not included in the final sample
due to: experimenter error (n = 10), fussiness (n = 9), or
parent interference (n = 4). There were equal number of
boys and girls.
Materials
Toddlers were introduced to a purple box (37.6 cm× 29.2
cm. × 20.3 cm.) with two handles (21.6 cm in length). The
left handle was red with black stripes. The right handle was
green with white spots. See Figure 1. The box was placed
in front of a black foam board screen (117.9 cm × 97.8
cm). The experimenter could hide behind the screen and
observe the child through pinholes in the screen. Two
openings in the screen on either side of the box allowed the
experimenter to reach her hands through to manipulate the
handles. The box had an opening in the back and the top so
that the experimenter could conceal her hand in the box and
lift objects out of the box. When a handle was pressed the
experimenter lifted either a lollipop (9.4 cm in diameter) or
a toy cake (7.6 cm in height, 7.6 cm in width) out of the
box. An MVP player was also used: the red handle was
always accompanied by the sound of an ascending scale on
a xylophone; the green handle was always accompanied by
the sound of a descending scale on a xylophone.
Procedure
Toddlers were recruited from a local Children’s Museum
and tested in a private room located on the museum floor.
The child was placed in a high chair approximately 100 cm
in front of the box. The child’s parent sat to the right of the               Figure 1: Procedure of the experiment.
