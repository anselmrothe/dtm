flickering presentation of the two random-dots circles. The
participant was instructed that random-dots circles would
turn into an uniform gray circle if her/his eyes were fixed
into the fixation cross. After 5000 ms of flickering
presentation, the participant could take a short break, and
was allowed to start next trial by her/his own pace. The
training had 30 trials and took approximately 5 min.
Delayed discrimination task After the eye-fixation training,
the participant took part in the delayed discrimination task.
The apparatus was identical to those for the eye-fixation
training.
   Typical trial sequence was shown in the Figure 1. Each
trial began with 200 ms of a fixation cross against black
background. Then two identical color patches filled with
one of the 4 colors appeared 3.9° left and right from the
center as probes1, and a blank screen followed for 300 ms or
4800 ms. After the blank, a fixation cross appeared again for
200 ms (therefore, the ISI was 500 ms or 5000 ms), and then
target color patch was presented 3.9° left or right from the
center for 200 ms. The target could have an adjacent color
or the same color as the probes. The participant judged if the
color of the target was identical to that of the probes by
hitting the left or right key as quickly as s/he could. A half
of the participants hit the left key if the target and probes
had the same color, and the other half hit the right key
instead. Response times (RTs) were recorded from the onset                  Figure 1: Illustration of a trial sequence of the delayed

After a response had been made or 2000 ms had elapsed, the
