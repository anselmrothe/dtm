Abstract
In two experiments we explored whether participants would
be able to use probabilistic cues to simplify perceptually
demanding visual search in a task we call the retrieval
guidance paradigm. On each trial a background cue appeared
prior to (and during) the search task and the diagnosticity of
the background cue(s) was manipulated to provide complete,
partial, or non-diagnostic information regarding the target’s
color on each trial. Only when participants were made aware
of the possible relationship between the background cues and
target features were they able to utilize the cue information
for search. When participants were not made aware of the
possible connection, they were only able to use target base
rates. In the General Discussion we address how a recent
computational model of hypothesis generation (HyGene,
Thomas, et al., 2008), provides a useful framework for
understanding how long-term memory, working memory, and
attention coordinate in visual search.
Keywords: attention, memory, visual search, hypothesis
generation.

In the present research we examined whether participants
would be able to use experience in order to reduce the
perceptual demands of visual search. More specifically, we
ask whether participants would be able to use cues to
retrieve associated target features in service of visual search.
We argue that much of our day to day visual search relies on
such long-term memory (LTM) retrieval to define an
attentional set to support search. To investigate the
processes unfolding in such circumstances we have
developed a novel visual search paradigm in which
participants are provided with cues that probabilistically
predict a target feature (its color) in a forthcoming search
array. We refer to this procedure as the retrieval guidance
paradigm as retrieval of likely target colors given a cue will
drastically improve search.
The usefulness of the paradigm lies partly in the
ecologically relevant variables it affords control over.
Importantly, it allows us to assess people’s sensitivity to the
probabilistic relationships between cues and targets through
1) the global base rate of a target (raw frequency of
occurrence) and an individual cue’s diagnosticity (i.e., its
predictive ability). Both of these characteristics influence
the posterior probability and thus should influence retrieval

from LTM.
Related research examining how people use systematic
cue-target associations to support visual search has largely
focused on the contextual cueing paradigm. The general
trend in these experiments is that targets within repeated
visual scenes (having the same target to distracter spatial
configurations) are found faster than non-repeated scenes
(Chun & Jiang, 1998). One of the most intriguing aspects of
the results emanating from this paradigm is that the
facilitation of repeated scenes operates at an implicit level of
awareness as participants are unable to distinguish between
repeated scenes versus novel scenes in a recognition task.
Much of this research has focused on comparing conditions
where cues perfectly predict the location of the target and
conditions in which cues are non-diagnostic. However,
many of the environments that we encounter are
probabilistic such that cues have varying degrees of
diagnosticity regarding possible target characteristics.
Moreover, recent research has suggested that there is
minimal attentional guidance in contextual cueing (Kunar,
Flusberg, Horowitz, & Wolfe, 2007), suggesting that the
paradigm may be lacking in allowing for the examination of
how LTM, working memory (WM) and attention coordinate
in a visual search task. In the present study we offer a new
paradigm that allows for the promise of: 1) investigation
into whether probabilistic relationships can be learned and
exploited in a visual search task (c.f. contextual cueing,
Zellin, Conci, Muhlenen, & Muller, 2011), and 2) an
examination of how LTM, WM, and attention coordinate in
a visual search task. We accomplish this by manipulating
both target base rates and cue diagnosticities within the
same experimental paradigm (and within subject) by pairing
background cues (preceding the onset of a search array)
with critical target features (i.e., colors). Thus, the
background cues provide complete, partial, or nondiagnostic information regarding the color of the target in
the upcoming search array.
To foreshadow the findings of the present study, in
Experiment 1 we find that participants are able to find a
target faster when its color is associated with a more
diagnostic cue. However, Experiment 2 reveals that when
participants are explicitly aware of the associations between
the cues and the color of the target, their visual search

1964

performance is significantly improved (over the participants
of Experiment 1). This difference is explained by
participants reliance solely on target base rate or retrieval
from LTM to guide search processes.

Experiment 1
Experiment 1 was conducted to assess the degree to which
participants would use cue information to simplify a
difficult visual search task. Participants were asked to
respond to a specific orientation of a “T” (rotated 90 degree
clockwise or 90 degrees counterclockwise), while ignoring
modified “L” letters in a visual array. Each visual array
contained 14 different items (13 distracters and 1 target),
with each item being unique in color. Note that there was
always a target present in each search array and the search
array was presented until participants responded (i.e., there
was no time limit).
On each trial, a background cue appeared prior to (and
during) the search array. The background cues consisted
either of circles, squares, or triangles and were positioned
randomly on the screen (i.e., one cue consisted of only
circles, another only squares, and the last only triangles).
The statistical relationship between the background cues and
the identity of the upcoming target was manipulated in order
to provide complete, partial, or non-diagnostic information
regarding the color of the forthcoming target. Table 1
provides the contingency table describing how the
backgrounds were paired with the different colors (see
Figure 1 for an example background). For example,
background 2 was paired with colors 2 and 3 (C2 and C3)
such that when background 2 was presented the target’s
color was C2 on 60% of trials and C3 on 40% of trials (note
that although C1 and C4-C14 were always present in the
array when background 2 was presented, they were always
“L”s in the search array). Each participant was exposed to
each of the different background cues throughout the entire
experiment (i.e., a within-subjects design was used).
Participants went through 360 trials (i.e., 6 Epochs of 60
trials each. Within each epoch the 3 backgrounds were
presented 20 times each and were randomly selected for
each trial. For each Epoch C1 was the target 20 times given
background 1, C2 was the target 12 times given background
2, C3 was the target 8 times given background 2, and each
of the fourteen colors (C1-C14) appeared as the target
roughly 1.43 times given background 3. Thus, the base rate
(raw frequency) of each color appearing as the target per
epoch was approximately 21.43 for C1, 13.43 for C2, 9.43
for C3, and 1.43 for C4-C14.
Participants were not informed at the beginning of the
experiment that a statistical relationship existed between
particular backgrounds cues and the color of the target.
Because of this, at the conclusion of the experiment they
were asked whether they noticed a statistical relationship
between particular backgrounds and the target colors. After
providing an answer, participants performed a recognition
task. For each trial during the recognition task, participants
were provided with a search array that contained a target of

a particular color. The color of the target was either valid
(the target was paired with that background in the
experiment) or invalid. Participants performed the
recognition task for the three different backgrounds. The
participant’s recognition performance was used as a
measure of their explicit knowledge concerning the cuehypothesis contingencies.

were paired with the different colors (C1-C14) for

Method
Participants Twenty-two participants (10 females; Mage =
19) from the University of Oklahoma participated in
Experiment 1 for course credit. All participants reported
normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Four participants
were excluded from the analysis due to high error rates
(error rates ≥ 15%) during the visual search task, leaving 18
participants for the analysis.
Stimuli and Apparatus Stimuli were presented on a 17”
monitor, controlled by a Dell computer with a 3 GHz
Pentium 4 processor.
Distance to the monitor was
approximately 60 cm. Stimulus presentation and data
recording were controlled via E-Prime 2 by PST, Inc. The
following 14 colors were used in all of the experiments
presented black, blue, brown, cyan, green, lime, magenta,
maroon, orange, pink, red, tan, white, and yellow. All the
stimuli (the T’s and L’s) in the visual search array were 22
mm x 22 mm. For each visual array each of the 14 items
were placed randomly at one of 35 possible locations based
on 3 ellipses of varying sizes.
Procedure. Each trial started with a fixation followed by a
background cue (2004 ms). The search array then followed.
Participants were told to find the rotated “T” as quickly as
possible and press the F-key when the “T” was rotated 90
degrees counterclockwise and the J-key when it was rotated
90 degrees clockwise. After responding a brief mask was
presented (68 ms) followed by a feedback screen (500 ms)
that indicated whether the response to the visual search
array was correct. Figure 1 provides a schematic of the main
components of each trial (i.e., the background cue and
visual search array). Following the completion of all 360
visual search trials the participants then performed the
recognition task as described above.

Results
For our main analysis, we examined RTs for each of the cue
validity conditions. Trials in which the orientation of the
target was mis-reported (4.19 %), as well as trials with RTs
faster than 200 ms or slower than 10,000 ms (2.66 %) were
removed prior to analysis. We report the differences in the
cue validity conditions collapsed across the last 3 epochs
(although see Figure 2 for RT performance throughout the
entire experiment). Specifically, the means of the median
values (for each cue validity condition at Epochs 3-6) were
calculated for each participant for each cue validity
condition.
A within subjects repeated measures ANOVA revealed a
significant main effect of cue validity on visual search RTs,
F(2, 34) = 30.31, p < .01, η2p = 641. Pairwise comparisons
revealed a significant difference between all three
conditions such that the 100 (M = 1942.1 ms) cue validity
condition was significantly different from the 60/40 (M =
2667.1 ms) cue validity condition (p < .001) and the random
cue validity condition (p < .001). The 60/40 cue validity
condition was significantly different from the random (M =
3033.8 ms) cue validity condition (p = .003).

epoch and cue validity in Experiment 1.
Seven out of the 18 participants (38.88%) indicated that
they had noticed a relationship between the background and

the likelihood of the target being of a particular color 1. To
examine participant’s accuracy in the recognition task we
only considered the 100 and 60/40 cue-validity conditions.
The overall accuracy rate for the recognition task was at
chance level (50.93%). Accuracy rates for the different cue
validity conditions were 55.56%, and 48.61% for the 100
and 60/40 cue validity conditions.
Participants who
indicated that they recognized a relationship between the
background and the likelihood of the target being a
particular color were no better at the recognition task, with
accuracy rates of 50% for both the 100 and 60/40
conditions. Note that when the participants that indicated
that they noticed a relationship were excluded from the
analysis, a similar pattern of RT results as described above
was obtained. Additionally, a between-subjects analysis of
RTs did not reveal a significant difference between the
group that indicated that they noticed a relationship from
those that did not, F(1, 16) = 1.355, p = .262.

Discussion
In Experiment 1 we found improved search performance in
accordance with the diagnosticity of the background cue.
This RT result, coupled with the poor recognition
performance suggests that participants may have been using
the background cues at an implicit level of awareness,
which is common in the contextual cueing literature.
One of the striking aspects concerning the results from
many contextual cueing studies is its implicit nature (e.g.,
Chun & Jiang, 1998; 1999). That is, although participants
are able to find a target faster when aspects of a scene are
repeated (as opposed to when they are changed), this occurs
at an implicit level as participants are not able to
discriminate the visual scenes they have viewed previously
from those they have not (at the end of the training).
Therefore, it could be an implicit utilization of contextual
cues that explains the observed discrepancy between search
and recognition performance in the present data. However,
it should be pointed out that there is another possible
explanation of the results for Experiment 1, which is
explored below.
The second possible interpretation of the results holds that
participants were essentially ignoring the background cues
(and by extension the cue target associations), but were
noting the likelihood of the target colors across all trials
(i.e., the target color base rates). That is, participants’
expectations regarding the color of the target may have been
based on the unconditionalized base rate of the target color
across all background conditions. For instance, let’s assume
that the color of the target is red in the 100 cue validity
condition.
After enough trials participants adopt an

During debriefing some of the 7 participants that answered
affirmatively to the question “Did you notice any relationship
between the background and the target colors?” were confusing the
probability of target color given background with the probability of
the target being a particular color (i.e., the base rate of the target
colors). Thus, it is likely that even fewer than 7 participants truly
noticed the association between target color and background.

attentional set for red and begin searching for the red item
across all background conditions, even though red is not
valid for the other cue validity conditions. Likewise the
higher likelihood of the targets in the 60/40 condition makes
them suitable targets across all background conditions as
well. This explanation is supported by a study by Kunar,
Flusberg, & Wolfe (2006) that demonstrated improved
search efficiency for consistently mapped search arrays
when the delay between cue and array onset was sufficiently
increased and participants were explicitly told about the
relationship between cues and the critical aspect of the
target. In Experiment 2 we investigate the two possibilities
discussed above, by explicitly informing participants about
the possible relationships between the background cues and
the colors of the target.

RTs. Pairwise comparisons revealed a significant difference
between the 100 (M =1053.5 ms) cue validity condition to
the 60/40 (M = 1885.3 ms) cue validity condition (p < .001)
and the Random (M =3243.3 ms) cue validity condition (p <
.001).
The 60/40 cue validity condition was also
significantly different from the Random cue validity
condition (p < .001).

epoch and cue validity in Experiment 2.

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 assessed whether participants in Experiment 1
were merely using base rate information to inform search or
if they were using the background cues to improve search
performance by developing a conditional attentional set.
The experiment was nearly identical to Experiment 1 except
there was a knowledge test at the end of each epoch, as
opposed to the recognition test administered at the end of
Exp. 1. The intention of this manipulation was to provide a
hint to the participants that the background cues and the
color of the targets were systematically associated.

We next performed a between subjects analysis
comparing the respective cue validity conditions of
Experiment 2 to Experiment 1 (the mean values obtained
whilst collapsing across the last epochs) with cue validity
(100, 60/40, Random) as a within subjects variable and
Experiment as a between subjects variable.

Method
Participants Twenty-Seven participants (23 females; Mage =
20.6) from the University of Oklahoma participated in
Experiment 2 for course credit (26 participants) or $10. All
participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Two participants were excluded from the analysis due to a
high error rate (error rate ≥ 15%) and one was excluded for
having exceptionally long RTs as determined by having a
mean RT value more than 3 standard deviations higher than
the average for the mean of the collapsed 100, 60/40, and
random conditions.
Procedure The same procedure used in Experiment 1 was
used in Experiment 2 with the following exception. At the
end of each epoch, participants were asked to indicate the
most likely colors of the target (up to 4) given the cue.

Results
Error trials were excluded from analysis (2.3 %) as well as
trials with RTs faster than 200 ms and slower than 10,000
ms (5.1%). Errors were not analyzed in any manner.
As in Experiment 1 we collapsed across the last 3 epochs
(see Figure 3 for RT performance across all epochs). A
within subjects ANOVA revealed a main effect of cue
validity, F(2, 32) = 133.302, p < .001, η2p = .847 on search

Figure 4: Reaction time performance comparing the
participants of Experiment 2 with the participants of
Experiment 1. Error bars represent standard errors. Note that
the bars represent the means for Epochs 4-6.
A main effect of cue validity was found (F(2,82)
=134.183, p < .001, η2p = .766) as well as a main effect for
Experiment such that participants were faster in Experiment
2 than in Experiment 1, (F(1,33) =15.533, p < .001, η2p =
.275). An interaction between Experiment and cue validity
was observed, (F(2,82) = 18.26, p < .001, η2p = .308). A
Post-hoc analysis revealed a significant difference when
comparing the 100 cue validity condition in Experiment 2 to
the 100 cue validity condition in Experiment 1 (p < .001)
and also the 60/40 cue validity condition was significantly
different across experiments (p = .012), but the Random cue
validity condition was not significantly different across
Experiments (p = 1.0). Thus, participants were significantly
faster to find the target when they were informed of the
possible connection between the cues and the color of the

1967

target, suggesting that the participants in Experiment 1 were
merely relying on base rate information to guide
search2.There were also quite large differences in memory
performance as well in Experiment 2. To examine whether
this had an influence on the visual search process we split
the participants into two groups based on their performance
in the memory task. If a participant named the 100 color
first for background 1 and the 60/40 colors first or second
(in any order) for background 2 at one time during testing
(out of the 6 times to do so), and only those colors, they
were placed into the good memory performance group (17
participants) and the others were placed into the poor
memory performance group (8 participants). Figure 5 plots
the good and poor memory performers in the knowledge
test.

over the course of the experiment whereas the poor memory
participants did not.

.011, η2p = .179. Although a between subjects analysis using
a post-hoc Bonferonni test did not reveal a significant
difference when comparing the 100 cue validity condition of
the good memory performers (M =893) to the poor memory
performers (M =1394.7) of Experiment 2 (p = .59), a
significant difference was observed when comparing the
respective 60/40 cue validity conditions (p = .012). The
good memory performers were faster in the 60/40 condition
(M =1601.1) relative to the poor memory performers (M
=2489.2).
Because there seemed to be a qualitative difference in
search RTs for the poor memory performers to the good
memory performers, we next compared the poor memory
performers of Experiment 2 to the participants of
Experiment 1 to examine whether these two sets of
participants were qualitatively similar. A main effect of cue
validity was found (F(1, 48) =51.985, p < .001, η2p = .684).
There was no effect for Experiment, (F(1, 24) = 1.028, p =
.321, η2p = .041). An interaction was observed, (F(2, 48) =
3.568, p = .036, η2p = .129), however, a post-hoc analysis
revealed that the 100 cue validity condition was not
significantly different across groups (p = .91) nor was the
60/40 cue validity condition (p = 1.0), nor the Random cue
validity condition (p = 1.0). Thus, it appears that the poor
memory performers: 1) were qualitatively different than the
good memory performers of Experiment 2, particularly for
the 60/40 cue validity condition and 2) were qualitatively
similar to the participants of Experiment 1 for the 100 and
60/40 cue validity conditions.

Discussion

We performed a between subjects analysis on the visual
search RTs to compare the good memory performers from
the poor memory performers, with cue validity (100, 60/40,
Random) as a within subjects variable and memory
performance (good, poor) as a between subjects variable.
This analysis revealed a significant main effect of cue
validity (F(2, 46) = 123.781, p < .001, η2p = .843) as well as
memory performance on search RTs (F(1, 23) = 12.881, p
= .002, η2p = .359) such that participants were faster as cue
validity increased and participants who performed well in
the memory task were faster overall in the visual search
task. An interaction between cue validity and memory
performance type was also revealed F(2,46) = 5.007, p =
2
Although this statement is conjecture, we have additional
empirical evidence that the participants’ performance in
Experiment 1 is entirely compatible with the notion that they were
only using base rate information. In an additional follow up
experiment we eliminated the diagnosticity of the background
cue(s) by presenting only one background throughout the entire
experiment (i.e., on each trial they saw the same background cue).
We found remarkably similar performance in this experiment as
compared to Experiment 1. Post hoc analysis revealed no
differences between the 100 and 60/40 cue validity conditions
across experiments (both p’s = 1.0).

Experiment 2 revealed that the participants who learned the
associations between the cues and the critical features of the
target were able to leverage that information in the visual
search task. Although participants were unable to pick up on
the cue-target associations without a suggestion from the
experimenter that such a relationship may exist (see
Footnote 2 and General Discussion), most participants were
able to do so once this relationship was suggested in
Experiment 2. We also found that performance of the poor
memory performers was similar to that of the participants in
Experiment 1. In the General Discussion we posit that an
important cognitive mechanism (i.e., attentional selection)
was not operating over the cues for the participants of
Experiment 1 and the poor memory performers in
Experiment 2, thus disabling them from using the cues to
improve their search.

General Discussion
In two experiments we explored whether participants would
be able to use cues to simplify a perceptually demanding
visual search task. We found that although participants were
sensitive to base rate information in Experiment 1,
Experiment 2 revealed that the participants in Experiment 1
were likely not utilizing the background cues. Although this
conclusion may be un-warranted given that a cue validity
effect was found in Experiment 1, we ran an additional

1968

experiment where the diagnosticity of the background cues
was eliminated by using the same background cue for the
different cue validity conditions. We found remarkably
similar performance to Experiment 1 such that there were no
differences for the 100 and 60/40 cue validity conditions
(see Footnote 2).
In Experiment 2 we also found a qualitative difference
between participants who performed well on the knowledge
tests versus those that did not. The good memory performers
were faster overall and were particularly faster when the
background cue suggested two features (i.e., the 60/40
condition). Thus, it appears that suggestion of the possible
cue to target color connection and explicit knowledge of the
cue-target associations (as evidenced by good performance
in the memory task) are important factors in contributing to
the use of cues from the environment to support conditional
visual search in the retrieval guidance paradigm (c.f.
contextual cueing; Chun & Jiang, 1998; 1999). The results
suggest that the paradigm used allows for an examination of
how LTM memory, WM, and attention coordinate in a
visual search task.
We argue that the difference between these two sets of
participants is due to attentional selection (see TurkBrowne, Jungé, & Scholl, 2005). We suggest that the poor
memory performers of Experiment 2 and the participants of
Experiment 1 were not attending to the background cue on
each trial and thus were not able to exploit the cues later in
the experiment (i.e., Epochs 3-6). The good memory
performers, on the other hand, were attending to the cues,
thereby allowing them to encode the cue-target color
associations into LTM, and exploit their memories as the
task progressed. We now turn to a discussion of how a
recent model of hypothesis generation called HyGene (short
for Hypothesis Generation; Dougherty, Thomas, & Lange,
2010; Thomas, Dougherty, Sprenger, & Harbison, 2008)
provides a useful framework for theorizing about
interactions between visual search and memory within the
retrieval guidance paradigm and beyond.
Although HyGene was originally developed to bridge
research concerning LTM, WM, and judgment & decision
making, we argue that it provides a useful framework for
understanding how WM and LTM interact to support visual
search. In this framework, an individual receives
information from the environment, such as the background
cue in the present experiment, which prompts the generation
of hypotheses previously associated with the observed
information. In the case of the retrieval guidance paradigm,
the hypotheses being retrieved are the likely colors of the
forthcoming target on each trial. The retrieved hypotheses
are placed into WM and are then available to drive search
processes in a top-down manner (e.g., Desimone & Duncan,
1995), affording the filtering out of perceptual information
that is discordant with WM content.
Although we believe that HyGene provides a useful
framework for understanding ecological visual search, it
currently does not have direct access to the outside world
(i.e., visual input). Because of this, the model cannot yet

make specific predictions which are likely important to
visual search researchers (e.g., RTs, fixations). Thus, it
would be fruitful to integrate HyGene with models of visual
search, such as the guided search model (Wolfe, 1994) or
the more recent target acquisition model (Zelinsky, 2008).
Not only would such models be able to perform visual
search, but they would also would generate predictions
concerning information foraging (e.g., Hypothesis testing;
Dougherty, Thomas, & Lange, 2010).
