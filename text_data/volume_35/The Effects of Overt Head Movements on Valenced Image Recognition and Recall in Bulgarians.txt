nature, as Förster & Strack suggest, we should expect the
exact opposite results: facilitation for encoding negative
images while performing VHM and facilitation for encoding
positive images while performing HHM. Thus, the results
would give insight into the extent to which culture mediates
this effect.

experiment’s procedure were as follows: Participants were
explicitly told to try to remember as many of the images
from the slideshow as possible, as they would be asked to
recall them later, after filling out the feedback form.
Following the learning phase, participants were asked to
write down all the images they could remember, listing each                                                     Image Valence
