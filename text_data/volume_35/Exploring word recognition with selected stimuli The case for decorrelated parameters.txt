Figure 1: (on previous page) The top row shows the distribution of parameter values for the stimulus set, separately for words
(blue) and pseudowords (red), in comparison to all corpus types (light peach) and tokens (light blue). Bars display proportions
of items, adding up to 1.0. The other rows display the effects of each of the six experimental parameters on naming (Rows
2 and 3) and on lexical decision (Rows 4 and 5). Each box displays residual item effects (grey circles) in a model including
baseline effects and all parameters except one. The red solid line plots a smoothed average (via function lowess) of these points.
The dotted red line shows the effect estimate for this parameter when added to the predictor set, resulting in a full model. The
teal solid line plots a smoothed average of the centered raw item means. The dotted green line shows the effect estimate of the
parameter when included in a model with baseline and random effects only, absent all other parameters. The red and green
numbers at the top of each panel are the corresponding effect estimates (β)  ˆ for the same-color dotted lines, whereas the numbers
at the bottom of each panel are the proportions of item variance accounted for by this fixed effect; an asterisk denotes significant
contribution (by likelihood ratio test). The vertical axis is scaled in log milliseconds (with respect to the grand mean intercept).
Note different scaling of horizontal axes between parameters and also between distributions (top row) and effects panels.
