Environmental Statistics as Prior Knowledge
  Researchers can use Bayesian models of cognition to
simulate the responses that people would make if their
computational-level solution to the prediction problem is
well described by the model. This process requires that the
model includes representations of the prior knowledge
people have about the phenomena being predicted.
Researchers can represent prior knowledge in their models
by collecting real-world environmental statistics and using
them in their models as a stand-in for the subjective prior
knowledge of individuals (Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2006
Hemmer & Steyvers, 2009a; Hemmer & Steyvers, 2009b).
