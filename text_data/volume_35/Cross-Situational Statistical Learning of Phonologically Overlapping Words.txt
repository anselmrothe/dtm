paradigm. In this experiment, learners were exposed to eight
novel English words and eight picture referents with no
explicit instructions. To examine the effect of word-pair
similarity on word learning, the experiment presented
learners with monosyllabic words such as “bon” and “deet”                           /tɔn/                         /dɪt/

phonological overlap: (1) non-minimal pairs (nonMP), (2)
near minimal pairs (nearMP), (3) vowel minimal pairs
(vowelMP), and, (4) consonant minimal pairs (consMP).

discover which word was associated with which picture.
   Across the learning phase, there were a total of 36
learning trials, presented in a counterbalanced order. As
mentioned above, stimuli were presented in pairs, with each
trial consisting of two different pictures and two different
words. There were 18 nonMP trials, and 6 each of nearMP,
vowelMP, and consMP trials presented during the learning
phase. Figure 2 shows examples of nonMP, nearMP and
consMP trials, respectively.
   After the learning phase, two testing phases were
presented, though only one is reported here. In the first
testing phase, stimuli were presented through Tobii Studio,
as in the training phase. This phase followed immediately
after the testing phase and participants were not given any
additional instruction. Participants’ eye-gaze was recorded
without them having to make any overt response. This was
done to later compare these adult data to infant eye-gaze to
the same training and testing trials (Escudero, Mulak &
Vlach in preparation-a).
