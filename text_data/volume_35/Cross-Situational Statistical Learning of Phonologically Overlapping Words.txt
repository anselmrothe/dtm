ambiguity in word-referent pairings across moments in time.
This phenomenon is most commonly termed crosssituational or statistical word learning (e.g., Fazly,
Alishahi, & Stevenson, 2010; Frank, Goodman, &
Tenenbaum, 2009; Smith & Yu, 2008; Vlach & Sandhofer,
2011; Yu & Smith, 2007, 2011).
In a typical experiment, learners are presented with a
series of ambiguous learning events, which include multiple
words and multiple objects. After a series of learning events,
adult participants are presented with a forced-choice test in
which they are asked to infer object-label pairings, while
infants are presented with a preferential-looking task. This
body of work has revealed that infants (e.g., 12- and 14month-olds; Smith & Yu, 2008) and adults (e.g., Yu &
Smith, 2007) are able to learn word mappings by tracking
co-occurrence probabilities across learning events.
Cross-situational statistical learning research has focused
on questions examining learners’ ability to determine wordreferent pairings. However, in real-world language learning
environments, learners are faced with the challenge of
determining word-referent pairings while simultaneously
engaging in other cognitive processes that support language
learning. For example, learners must simultaneously
determine word-referent pairings while parsing words that
overlap phonologically.
To date, experiments have primarily used words that
contain gross phonological differences, that is, words that
differ in multiple sound segments, such as “beat” and “rule”.
However, many words, especially in English, contain the
same sounds with the exception of one segment, either a
vowel or a consonant. In other words, they form
phonologically minimal pairs such us “beat”-“bit” or “bet”“debt”. Consequently, it is unknown whether learners are
able to simultaneously learn cross-situational statistics while
distinguishing phonologically minimal pairs.
Adults have difficulty in learning phonologically minimal
pairs. For example, Dutch and Spanish listeners were
presented with a word learning task in which they were
explicitly taught twelve pseudo-words together with their
corresponding visual referents (Escudero, Broersma, &
Simon, 2012). The words followed Dutch phonotactic

Abstract
Recent research has sought to examine how learners are able
to track the co-occurrence of words and objects across
moments in time, a behavior commonly termed crosssituational statistical learning. The current experiment was
designed to examine if learners can simultaneously determine
word-referent pairings while engaging in other cognitive
processes that support language learning, such as
distinguishing phonologically overlapping words. Participants
were presented with a cross-situational statistical learning task
with pairs of words in four categories: non-minimal pairs,
near minimal pairs, vowel minimal pairs, and consonant
minimal pairs. The results revealed that participants were able
to simultaneously learn word-referent pairings while
distinguishing all four categories of word pairings. However,
learners experienced the most difficulty learning vowel
minimal pairs. This work demonstrates that learners are able
to simultaneously engage in multiple cognitive processes that
support language learning.

Introduction
In one moment in time, the world presents learners with a
seemingly infinite amount of information. Across several
fields of study, including cognitive psychology,
developmental psychology, computer science, and
linguistics, a large research pursuit has been to characterize
how it is that learners acquire, store, and later retrieve such a
large data set of information. Indeed, this task has
historically been characterized as theoretically impossible
(e.g., Quine, 1960), but yet learners appear to acquire a great
deal of information with ease.
A more recent trend in research has been to examine how
it is that learners acquire, store, and later retrieve
information across several moments in time. For example,
in the domain of language learning and development,
research has sought to determine how learners resolve

418

probabilities and were produced by a Dutch female speaker.
Their visual referents were pictures of novel objects. At test,
the native Dutch listeners made more errors for words that
formed a minimal pair (e.g. “pax”-“pix”) than when they
formed a non-minimal pair (e.g. “beeptoe”-“pix”). Spanish
listeners demonstrated an even greater difficulty in this task
for minimal pairs that contained Dutch vowel contrasts that
are not present in Spanish (e.g. “piex”-“pix”, “pax”-“paax”).
Can learners simultaneously learn cross-situational
statistics and distinguish phonologically overlapping words?
The current study examined whether phonologically
overlapping words or minimal pairs can be successfully
learned within a typical cross-situational statistical learning
paradigm. In this experiment, learners were exposed to eight
novel English words and eight picture referents with no
explicit instructions. To examine the effect of word-pair
similarity on word learning, the experiment presented
learners with monosyllabic words such as “bon” and “deet”
that when paired, formed four different levels of
phonological overlap: (1) non-minimal pairs (nonMP), (2)
near minimal pairs (nearMP), (3) vowel minimal pairs
(vowelMP), and, (4) consonant minimal pairs (consMP).

referents for the words were colorful pictures of novel items
previously used in studies of cross-situational word learning
(e.g., Vlach & Sandhofer, 2011).

Method
Participants
Participants were 71 undergraduates at the University of
Western Sydney. A language background questionnaire
revealed that 31 participants were monolingual English
speakers, whose age range was 17.85 years to 52.19 years
(M = 26.52 years, SD = 10.21 years; 10 males), while 40
participants spoke two or more languages and ranged in age
from 17.73 years to 28.94 years (M=20.70 years, SD = 3.18;
7 males). English was the dominant language of all
participants.

Figure 1. The eight novel words and their novel object
referents.
Stimuli were presented in pairs, with four types of
phonological overlap between the two spoken words that
were the names of the pictures within a pair: (1) nonminimal pairs (nonMP), where the two words in the pair
differed in all three sounds (e.g. /dɪt/-/pɔn/); (2) near
minimal pairs (nearMP), where the words overlapped in one
sound (e.g. /dɔn/-/dɪt/); (3) vowel minimal pairs (vowelMP),
where the words only differed in their vowel (e.g. /dɪt/-/dit/),
and, (4) consonant minimal pairs (consMP), where the
words differed in only their consonant (e.g. /bɔn/-/dɔn/).

Stimuli
Eight monosyllabic nonsense words were recorded by a
female native speaker of Australian English. Figure 1 shows
the eight spoken words (in phonetic symbols) together with
their randomly assigned picture referents. Four of the words
were minimally different in their first consonant (left), while
the other four differed in their vowel (right).
The novel words followed English phonotactic
probabilities and were chosen from those included in
previous studies with infant learners (see Curtin et al., 2009
for the words differing in vowels, and; Fikkert, 2010 for
those differing in consonants). The female speaker produced
a number of tokens of each word with child-directed
intonation contours. These words and speech style were
chosen to enable direct comparison of adult and infant
responses to the same stimuli (Escudero, Mulak & Vlach in
preparation-a).
Two tokens of each of the eight spoken words were
selected to be used in the experiment such that intonation
contours were comparable across words. The visual

Procedure
Participants were presented with the cross-situational
learning tasks in two phases: a learning phase and a
subsequent test phase.
During the learning phase, stimuli were presented via
Tobii Studio on a 17-inch screen, and the spoken words
played from two speakers positioned below the screen. In
each learning trial, two of the eight pictures of novel items
appeared on the screen while two novel words for the
pictures were spoken, such that pictures were either named
left to right, or right to left. The pairings of the words and
pictures were randomly assigned. The word for each picture
was played once with 500 ms between them.

occurred with one of the pictures during the learning phase.
The word was presented using two alternating repetitions of
the same two tokens of that word used in the training phase,
with a 500 ms interval between repetitions. Participants
were asked to select whether the word corresponded to the
left or right picture. There were 36 test trials in total with the
same picture pairs as in the training, but the left/right
positions of the pictures were randomized once for the test
trials.

Results
The current experiment sought to determine if learners
could simultaneously acquire cross-situational statistics in
order to learn word-referent pairings, and parse
phonologically minimal pairs. Figure 3 shows the
percentage of correct word-referent pairings chosen during
the testing trials, separately for the four different types of
phonologically overlapping pairs. Percentages for
monolingual and multilingual participants are presented
separately. This is because it has been shown that
bilingualism affects language processing, especially word
retrieval (Fennell, Byers-Heinlein, & Werker, 2007;
Bialystok, Craik, & Luk, 2008)

Trial 3: /bɔn/, / pɔn /

Figure 2. Examples of the word learning trials.

Participants were instructed to watch the pictures and
listen to the words and were not told that the words were
names for the pictures, nor were they asked to try and
discover which word was associated with which picture.
Across the learning phase, there were a total of 36
learning trials, presented in a counterbalanced order. As
mentioned above, stimuli were presented in pairs, with each
trial consisting of two different pictures and two different
words. There were 18 nonMP trials, and 6 each of nearMP,
vowelMP, and consMP trials presented during the learning
phase. Figure 2 shows examples of nonMP, nearMP and
consMP trials, respectively.
After the learning phase, two testing phases were
presented, though only one is reported here. In the first
testing phase, stimuli were presented through Tobii Studio,
as in the training phase. This phase followed immediately
after the testing phase and participants were not given any
additional instruction. Participants’ eye-gaze was recorded
without them having to make any overt response. This was
done to later compare these adult data to infant eye-gaze to
the same training and testing trials (Escudero, Mulak &
Vlach in preparation-a).
Here we report the results of the second testing phase
which was performed immediately after the first. During the
second test phase, participants performed a forced-choice
inference test, which required learners to infer word-picture
pairings by clicking on the corresponding computer key.
Stimuli were presented through a laptop computer with a
15-inch monitor, which was set up next to the monitor for
the training and first test phase. Stimuli presentation was
controlled with E-Prime and participants listened to the
stimuli through headphones.
During the test phase, participants saw a pair of pictures
and heard four repetitions of the word that always co-

the different pair types in monolingual and multilingual
listeners.
The first set of analyses examined learners’ overall
performance on the testing trials. Accuracy was above
chance for all pair types and in both participant groups
(M = 65-76%, t = 15-23, all ps < .001). These results
suggest that, despite the additional challenge of
distinguishing phonologically overlapping words, learners

420

are able to learn and infer word-referent pairings during
cross-situational statistical learning.
Further, a repeated measures ANOVA on the percentage
of correct word-referent pairings chosen on testing trials,
with pair type as the within-subject factor and language
group as a between-subjects factor, revealed a main effect of
pair type (F(3, 69) = 3.009, p = .031), which indicates that
both groups of listeners had lower performance for some
pair types than for others. Neither the main effect of
language group (F(1, 69 = 0.360, p = .550) nor the
interaction of pair type * language group (F(1, 69 = 0.31,
p = .942) yielded statistical significance. These results
suggest that, although there were not differences across
groups of learners, overall participants’ performance
differed across the word pair types.
To follow up the effect of pair type, a series of planned
comparisons were conducted between the pair types, with
Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons: four
comparisons (2-tailed). The results of these tests revealed
that participants were less accurate on vowelMP than on
nonMP (t(70) = -2.53, p = .014) and consMP (t = -2.44,
p = .017), while no difference was found between
consonants and nonMP (t (70) = 0.189, p = .850) or nonMP
and nearMP (t(70) = 1.468, p = .147). In sum, learners
demonstrated the lowest performance on the vowel minimal
pairs.

more critical in accessing the whole word form (see Berent
& Perfetti, 1995; Carreiras, Vergara, & Perea, 2007; Lee et
al., 2001; Lee, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2002; Perea &
Carreiras, 2006; Perea & Lupker, 2004). For example, in an
experiment using response time and electrophysiological
measures, Carreiras et al. (2009) demonstrated that a delay
in the presentation of consonant information is more
detrimental for lexical processing than a delay in
presentation of vowel information.
However, studies have also shown vowel information to
be more important than consonant information when
identifying words in fluent speech (Cole, Yan, Mak, Fanty,
& Bailey, 1996; Kewley-Port, Burkle, & Lee, 2007). In
Kewley-Port et al. (2007), the vowels or consonants were
removed from sentences produced in fluent speech and it
was found that vowel information had a 2:1 benefit over
consonant information for both young normal-hearing
listeners and elderly hearing-impaired listeners.
The authors argue that the reason why they find opposite
results to those of the studies described above is because
linguistic processing of monosyllables relies on sound-bysound, bottom-up information, while sentence intelligibility
tasks incorporate considerable predictive information from
top-down processing. Thus, in the context of fluent speech,
we may have observed a different pattern of results. Future
research should examine how acquiring cross-situational
statistics and distinguishing minimal word pairs may differ
in the context of fluent speech streams.
In that respect, Curtin et al. (2009) demonstrated that in
lexical acquisition, infants can learn some vowel minimal
pairs earlier than consonant minimal pairs, which suggests
vowels may have a more lexical role than consonants in
early word learning. However the authors explain that
different task demands may cause the contradictory results.
For example, Nazzi (2005) and Nazzi and New (2007), who
found contrasting results, used a task in which infants were
presented information from a real speaker, with multiple
labels in the interactive communication. These task
demands may thus be very different from the ones in the
explicit word-referent association task in Curtin et al.
(2009). Interestingly, Giezen, Escudero & Baker (under
review) suggest that these divergent results may have a
developmental nature, since they found more successful
vowel than consonant minimal pair learning in children,
while adults exhibited the opposite bias.
Ongoing research (Escudero, Mulak & Vlach, in
preparation-a) examines infant word learning abilities using
the same cross-situational word learning task as that of the
present study. The results of this new study will likely shed
light on the differential processing of vowels versus
consonants across development.
The lack of group effects in the present study suggests
that multilingualism does not influence cross-situational
word learning and word retrieval immediately after learning.
Interestingly, it runs contrary to studies that have
demonstrated a negative influence of multiple language
activation on word learning (Fennell et al., 2007) and

Discussion
The results demonstrate that young adults can successfully
learn monosyllabic nonsense words in a statistical crosssituational paradigm and without explicit instruction of
word-referent pairings. Specifically, learners are able to
simultaneously acquire cross-situational statistics and parse
phonologically minimal pairs when learning novel words.
Thus, the present study extends the findings of previous
cross-situational studies (e.g., Fazly et al., 2010; Frank et
al., 2009; Smith & Yu, 2008; Vlach & Sandhofer, 2011; Yu
& Smith, 2007) by demonstrating that a more challenging
set of word-referent pairings can still be learned through the
tracking of co-occurrence and statistical probabilities.
The current experiment also demonstrates that vowel
minimal pairs are more difficult to learn because
participants’ accuracy for vowel minimal pairs was lower
than that of non-minimal and consonant minimal pairs. This
finding is consistent with the numerous studies that
demonstrate that consonant information is more important
than vowel information for lexical processing (e.g., Berent
& Perfetti, 1995; Lee, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2001; Perea &
Carreiras, 2006; Perea & Lupker, 2004) and lexical
acquisition (Bonatti, Peña, Nespor, & Mehler, 2005; Nazzi
& New, 2007; Nazzi, 2005; Nespor, Peña, & Mehler, 2003;
Peña, Bonatti, Nespor, & Mehler, 2002).
The above line of research has proposed that the main role
of consonants is to signal word meaning, while vowels
enable the identification of rhythm and syntactic structure
(Nespor et al., 2003). Additionally, consonant information is

421

retrieval (Bialystok, Craik, & Luk, 2008), and a positive
influence on cognitive control (Bialystok et al., 2008;
Bialystok & Martin, 2004). Given that a bilingual
processing advantage has been shown across a wide range
of problem types, including both verbal and nonverbal
domains, the null effect in the present study may come as a
surprise. However, although word learning within a crosssituational paradigm involves intricate statistical
computations and a high load on short-term memory (see
Vlach & Sandhofer, 2011, for a discussion), the 2x2 (two
pictures and two spoken words per trial) learning condition
may have not provided enough challenge to observe
differences. It may be the case that, in the context of a crosssituational learning task with higher working memory
demands, the differences between monolingual and
multilingual learners will emerge.
Ongoing research (Escudero, Mulak & Vlach, in
preparation-b) is being conducted using tasks that present
many words and objects in each learning event, in turn
taxing working memory (e.g., in the context of 3x3 and 4x4
learning conditions). The results of this new study will
likely reveal the influence of multiple language activation
and cognitive control on the learning of phonologically
overlapping word pairs.
On a final note, it is important to highlight that this study
demonstrates the incredible capacity that human learners
possess for learning language. Mapping new words to
referents in the world has historically been characterized as
a theoretically impossible task (e.g., Quine, 1960).
However, the results of the current work demonstrate that
learners can map words to referents in the world while
simultaneously distinguishing phonologically overlapping
sounds into words. Indeed, learners appear to accomplish
multiple challenging cognitive tasks at the same time.
Future research should continue to examine the cognitive
processes that operate in parallel in order to support
language learning and development.
