the total amount of activation spreading from cues to
outcomes equal to the amount of activation arriving at them.
Analogous to the principle of conservation of electric
charge, this means that as vocabulary increases, and each
cue becomes connected to an increasing number of
outcomes, the amount of activation arriving at any given
outcome decreases. Given a vocabulary of size V, the
network support for any item i is proportional to ai /V where
ai is the activation an item receives from the cues in the
input.
   This modification also accounts for the effects that an
increased number of outputs have on information processing        Figure 2. Empirically observed vocabulary growth after sampling

materials). Shannon’s source coding theorem shows that the
smallest coding scheme for V words requires, on average,
H(V) bits. Since V determines the length of a message in a
given code, the effective channel capacity C of an ensemble
of neurons decreases as code complexity increases and the
amount of redundancy in signals across the network
decreases (Hentchel & Barlow, 1991). We denote these
information costs by f(V), where f is an unknown non-
decreasing function expressing the coding and signaling
costs in a vocabulary of size V.
