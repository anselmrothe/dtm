       Workshop Background and Relevance
Humans interact with other humans. They do so frequently,
in a wide variety of circumstances, to accomplish many
different goals. This interpersonal interaction, especially in
face-to-face circumstances, requires coordination (Clark,
1996). This involves many subtle behaviors, controlled
