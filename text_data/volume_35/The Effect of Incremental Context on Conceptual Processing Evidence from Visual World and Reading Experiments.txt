Discussion
In this self-paced reading experiment, we looked at the re-
lation between the amount of HB information in the context
and the reading time of the target concept. The hypotheses
we started with predict two distinct outcomes: the incremen-
tal activation hypothesis predicts that the reading time of the
target concept is reduced in proportion to the number of HB
context words that are present. On the other hand, based on
the immediate activation hypothesis, we expect that there is
a threshold on the amount of contextual information that is         Figure 1: Example of the scene for the target concept mush-
