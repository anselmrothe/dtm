It is claimed that the “bottom-up” approach help students
conceptually understand the implicit linkages between the
micro and macro level of the gas phenomena (Levy &
Wilensky, 2009).

to provide extra scaffolding for students to make connections

the second research question of this study is: How can we
help students make connections across system levels?
Scaffolding that elicits self-explanation could significantly
improve learning (Chi et al, 1994). Explicit level-bridging
scaffolding such as inter-level questions facilitates self-
explanation, and is an effective strategy in teaching complex
systems (Stieff, 2011). In this study, the effect of explicit
level-bridging scaffolding was tested.
