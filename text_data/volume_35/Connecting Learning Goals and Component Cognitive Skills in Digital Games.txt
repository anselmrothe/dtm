   Neither version of game was truly an “action game,” like
those that have been shown to train cognitive capacities in
other studies, but our manipulation of game versions
allowed us to isolate certain features of typical action
games. More specifically, as in typical action games, the
real-time game type encouraged monitoring multiple
regions of the screen and timing actions with onscreen
motion. Thus, the primary differences between the game
types are in terms of how players must distribute attention
and select relevant information. Therefore, in investigating
