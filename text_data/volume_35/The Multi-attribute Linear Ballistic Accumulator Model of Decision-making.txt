Individuals are often faced with the problem of choosing a
single option from a large set of possible alternatives where                                                                   CY
the options have several features. For example, when pur-
chasing a new cell phone, there are numerous phones from
which to choose and each phone has many different features.                                                Attribute 1
A robust finding in the choice behavior literature is that pref-
erences are subject to “context effects”. That is, preferences
for existing alternatives can be influenced or even reversed by         Figure 1: Various options plotted in a two dimensional at-
