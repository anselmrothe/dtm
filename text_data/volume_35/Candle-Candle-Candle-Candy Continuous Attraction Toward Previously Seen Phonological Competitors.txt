mouse movements might still reveal continuous attraction
towards previously seen competitors.
                        Experiment 1
In the first experiment, we presented each participant with
phonologically related and phonologically unrelated stimuli.
Mouse movements were recorded during each trial to
investigate the effects of repeated movements to
phonological and non-phonological competitors.
