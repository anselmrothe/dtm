Multi-layered experimental platform
In this study, to determine BCs within various systems, we
constructed an innovative experimental platform consisting
of three different types of systems: the real system using an
electric vehicle, the virtual system using a high fidelity driv-
ing simulator, and the laboratory system implemented as a                         !"#$%&"'$()(*&+$,(-./$".$&'&0*1-0$2&3-0'&!

The systems
Real system We used an instrumented vehicle called
COMS from Toyota Auto Body as the real system (Figure
1(a)). We equipped COMS with various sensors to record
participant behavior, car dynamics, and environmental data.
For participant behavioral data, manipulations of the steer-
ing wheel and brake/acceleration pedals were recorded. The
car dynamics data were obtained from speed, acceleration,
and angular velocity triaxial sensors. These data were col-               !4#$5-1*,"'$()(*&+$,(-./$"$3-/3$67&'-*)$71-2-./$(-+,'"*81!
lected at 2000 Hz. Three video cameras were mounted on the
COMS in three different positions: front, downward, and face
views. The front view camera captured the road conditions.
The downward view camera was directed at the road surface
and recorded road tags that identified where and when COMS
passed specific course points. The face view camera captured
the participants’ facial expressions and steering control. Time
codes were synchronized with the logged sensor and video
data.
Virtual system A vehicle motion simulator called carSim

characteristics with the real system, such as the front field of
