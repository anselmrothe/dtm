Abstract
This study investigated the degrees of consistencies in driving
behavior when operating a real system (real car), a virtual system (high fidelity driving simulator), and a laboratory system
(computer driving game). The same tendency of behavioral
consistencies was confirmed among the three systems: i.e., the
steering operation demonstrated the highest behavioral consistencies, followed by the acceleration and braking operations,
respectively. The individuality of driving behavior emerged
more in the braking and acceleration operations than in the
steering operation. The same tendency for behavioral consistencies of braking, acceleration, and steering operations was
confirmed in each of the three systems.
Keywords: behavioral consistency; driving behavior; individual differences; virtual environments

Introduction
In studies of human factors, analyses of human behavior are
usually conducted in actual environments using observational
methods. However, advances in computer technology are
now facilitating experiments on human factors by using various simulators because they provide a convenient and safe
method for assessing human behavior. Thus many studies
about human behavior in serious situations that may lead to
accidents have been performed, such as people driving cars,
operating airplanes, controlling industrial plants (e.g., dos
Santos et al., 2008; Kemeny, 2003; J. D. Lee et al., 2002; Metzger & Parasuraman, 2001; Parasuraman et al., 1996; Wickens & Alexander, 2009). Driving simulators in particular
have played an important role in automobile human factors
research for more than three decades. Various studies using
driving simulators have examined not only basic characteristics of driving behavior but also applied investigations of
those effects of drinking and aging that relate to social problems because using automobiles is a major part of our daily
lives (e.g., H. C. Lee et al., 2003; Mets et al., 2011; Pradhan
et al., 2005; Rizzo et al., 1997).

However, virtual systems cannot simulate real systems
completely. Therefore, many researchers agree that an examination of their validity is a crucial component in any study.
The validity of driving simulators has previously been evaluated through a comparison of behavior when driving real cars
and simulators (e.g., Törnros, 1998; Godley et al., 2002; Underwood et al., 2011; Shechtman et al., 2009; Mayhew et al.,
2011). Previous studies have discussed both commonalities
and specificities in the distributions of specific errors or characteristics of specific behaviors when operating real and virtual systems. Such discussions have an essential assumption
of the consistency of behavioral characteristics when driving
vehicles. However, we do not know to what human driving
behavior is consistent. In the present study, we examined behavioral consistency (BC) when driving vehicles on road and
using simulators.
The purpose of this study is to reveal the degree of BC by
analyzing three basic operations of driving behavior: braking,
acceleration, and steering operations. First, we investigate the
BCs for the three operations when driving a real car. Then, we
study the BCs in two other types of systems: a virtual system
as a high fidelity driving simulator and a laboratory system as
a low fidelity driving simulator (similar to a computer driving
game). The following outlines our basic strategies for the
investigation.
Imagine a situation in which drivers repeatedly drive on a
specific course. The BC within each participant shows the
degree of consistency in individual behavior when repeatedly driving on the same course. We also calculate the BCs
across participants, demonstrating the degree of consistency
in the general characteristics of human behavior independent
of each participant’s individuality. We refer to the former as
the intrapersonal BC and the later as the interpersonal BC.
In our analyses, the interpersonal BC is treated as the baseline because it reflects the generality of BCs across partici-

1444

pants. The intrapersonal BC is predicted to exceed the interpersonal BC. In this study, by comparing the inter- and
intrapersonal BCs, we attempt to answer the following two
research questions.
RQ1 To what degree is driving behavior, characterized by
the three basic operations of braking, acceleration, and
steering, consistent across individuals in the real system?
Is the tendency observed in the real system confirmed in
the two types of simulation systems?
RQ2 To what degree is individual behavior more consistent
than behavior across individuals in the real system? Is
the greater consistency of individual behavior in the real
system confirmed in the two simulator systems? In other
words, to what degree are the intrapersonal BCs greater
than the interpersonal BCs in each system?

similar to a typical laboratory setting (Figure 1(c)). The laboratory system was different from the other two systems in
many ways. For example, the road configuration was shown
from a top-down view and the vehicle controlled by the participants was depicted as a black dot. The car dynamics provide simple reactions for participant inputs. The participants
controlled the black dot using a gaming pad controller. When
the participants input right or left on the steering control, the
dot moved in the corresponding direction by pixels on the basis of the input time. Furthermore, the accelerator/braking
operations increased/decreased the dot velocity. The participant operation data were collected at 25 Hz.

Multi-layered experimental platform
In this study, to determine BCs within various systems, we
constructed an innovative experimental platform consisting
of three different types of systems: the real system using an
electric vehicle, the virtual system using a high fidelity driving simulator, and the laboratory system implemented as a
driving game(Figure 1).

The systems
Real system We used an instrumented vehicle called
COMS from Toyota Auto Body as the real system (Figure
1(a)). We equipped COMS with various sensors to record
participant behavior, car dynamics, and environmental data.
For participant behavioral data, manipulations of the steering wheel and brake/acceleration pedals were recorded. The
car dynamics data were obtained from speed, acceleration,
and angular velocity triaxial sensors. These data were collected at 2000 Hz. Three video cameras were mounted on the
COMS in three different positions: front, downward, and face
views. The front view camera captured the road conditions.
The downward view camera was directed at the road surface
and recorded road tags that identified where and when COMS
passed specific course points. The face view camera captured
the participants’ facial expressions and steering control. Time
codes were synchronized with the logged sensor and video
data.
Virtual system A vehicle motion simulator called carSim
from Mechanical Simulation Corporation was used as the virtual system (Figure 1(b)). The virtual system shared many
characteristics with the real system, such as the front field of
view that was 180◦ on three screens and the driver’s cockpit
with the same interior as a real car. The manipulations of the
steering wheel and brake/acceleration pedals were recorded
as participant behavioral data. These data were collected at
100 Hz.
Laboratory system In the laboratory system, stimuli were
presented to the participants on a 21-inch computer screen

and currently drive a car more than ten days a month.

Data treatment
In this study, we analyzed the BCs quantitatively. We defined the BCs of the braking, acceleration, and steering operations as similarities between feature vectors of each operation. In the real system, behavioral data of two participants
were treated as missing values because of equipment trouble.
In the virtual system, three participants could not participate
for personal reasons. Furthermore, in the experimental session using the virtual system, all trials of two participants and
four trials of four participants were treated as missing values
due to 3D sickness.
Feature vectors Here, we summarize the definitions of feature vectors. For example, the feature vector of a braking operation is calculated as follows.
(1) The time-series data of a braking operation in a trial were
divided into 26 sections. Each section corresponded to the
region between two pairs of adjoining red pylons (see Figure 2).

(2) The average amount of a braking operation in each section was calculated.
(3) The series of 26 data points corresponded to a feature
vector of a braking operation in each trial (see examples in
Figure 3 (a)).
We calculated 6 vectorial data for each operation from all
participants.
Behavioral Consistency as Similarity between Feature
Vectors The BCs in each operation were calculated as an
average of the similarity between two feature vectors using
Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (Expression 1). The vector components of x and y in Expression
1 correspond to 26 data points each, as shown in Figure 3.
Combinations of the feature vectors x and y are as follows
from the viewpoint of the participant factor.

Interpersonal BCs To discuss RQ1, the interpersonal BCs
within each system were calculated to determine to what degree driving behaviors are consistent across individuals in the
real system and whether such tendency observed in this system is confirmed in the other two systems. Specifically, first,
one participant (Participant 1) was selected, and the correlation coefficients were calculated between the feature vectors
of Participant 1 and those of another participant (Participant
2). Each had six feature vectors in each of the three operations of braking, acceleration, and steering; therefore, 18
(= (6 x 6)/2) combinations were considered for the calculation. The average of the correlation coefficients among the
18 combinations was calculated. Second, in a similar manner, by repeating the calculation of the average of correlation
coefficients between Participant 1 and the others, the average
amount, defined as the correlation coefficient of Participant
1, was calculated. Finally, the interpersonal BCs within each
system were calculated, defined as the average of the correlation coefficients of all participants (Participants 1–21).

Intrapersonal BCs To discuss RQ2, we calculated the intrapersonal BCs within each system to determine the degree
to which individual behavior is more consistent than behavior
across individuals in the real system and whether the greater
consistency of individual behavior in this system is confirmed
in the other two systems. Specifically, the correlation coefficients of one participant were calculated using 15 (= (6 x
5)/2) combinations and the average of the correlation coefficients among the 15 combinations was calculated. The intrapersonal BCs within each system were calculated, defined
as the average of the correlation coefficients of all participants
(Participants 1–21).

Results
Figure 4 shows the results of the inter- and intrapersonal BCs
when using the real system. A two-way within-participants
ANOVA for the operations (braking, acceleration, steering)
and participants (interpersonal, intrapersonal) factors showed
significant main effects of the operation and participant factors (F(2, 36) = 76.35, p < .01; F(1, 18) = 14.47, p < .01; respectively). Moreover, a significant interaction was noted between these factors (F(2, 36) = 9.90, p < .01). The detailed
results of the simple main effects tests are presented in Figure
4.
These results are summarized as follows: (1) In the interpersonal BCs, significant differences were found among the
three operations, with the interpersonal BC of the steering
operation as the highest, followed by those for acceleration
and braking operations, respectively. (2) In the intrapersonal

Environmental Constraints

Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the results of the inter- and intrapersonal BCs when using the virtual and laboratory systems, respectively. The two-way ANOVAs showed significant main effects for the operations and participants
factors in each system (virtual: F(2, 30) = 103.71, p <
.01; F(1, 15) = 32.31, p < .01, respectively, and laboratory:
F(2, 40) = 61.56, p < .01; F(1, 20) = 24.37, p < .01, respectively). Moreover, significant interactions were observed between these factors (virtual: F(2, 36) = 9.90, p < .01, laboratory: F(2, 40) = 7.97, p < .01). The results of the simple
main effect tests are shown in Figures 5 and 6.
These results for the virtual and laboratory systems were
similar to those for the real system. In the interpersonal
BCs, significant differences were noted among the three operations, with the interpersonal BC of the steering operation
being the highest, followed by those of the acceleration and
braking operations, respectively. This tendency was confirmed in the intrapersonal BCs, with the braking and acceleration operations higher than their interpersonal BCs. Only
in the laboratory system was a significant difference found
between the inter- and intrapersonal BCs of the steering operation. However, the effect size (Cohen’s d) in the steering
operation was relatively smaller than in the brake and acceleration operation (braking: 0.89, acceleration: 0.78, steering:
0.57).

Discussion
In this study, we constructed a multi-layered experimental
platform to determine the BCs of driving behavior on the
bases of two factors: the operations (braking, acceleration,
steering) and participants (interpersonal, intrapersonal).
In this section, we summarize the results of the experiments from the viewpoint of each research question and then
discuss them.

Summary of Experimental Results
RQ1 asks to what degree driving behaviors are consistent
across individuals in the real system and whether such a tendency is confirmed in the two different simulation systems.
The results indicate that in the real system, the interpersonal
BC of the steering operation was the highest, followed by
those of the acceleration and braking operations, respectively.
This tendency was confirmed in the virtual and laboratory
systems.
RQ2 is as follows: To what degree is individual behavior
more consistent than behavior across individuals in the real
system, and is the greater consistency of individual behavior
in the real system confirmed in the other two systems? The
analyses demonstrate that the intrapersonal BCs of both the
braking and acceleration operations were lesser than that of
the steering operation but they were higher than the interpersonal BCs for each system.

Experiment results reveal that the interpersonal BCs were different among the three operations in all systems: the interpersonal BC of the steering operation was the highest, followed
by those of the acceleration and braking operations, respectively. This result suggests that each operation is regulated by
different environmental constraints.
The higher environmental constraint on the steering operation than on the braking and acceleration operations might be
caused by the arrangement of the driving course. Constraints
based on driving course are recognized not only in the experimental setting but also in our daily driving situations. Our
steering operations are strictly regulated by road configurations, whereas both acceleration and braking operations have
high flexibility. That is, we usually do not out of traffic lanes,
whereas the gas pedal or brakes can be used comparatively
freely.
Additionally, there might be an interactive relation between
the braking and acceleration operations. In some literature regarding the computational model of driver behavior based on
cognitive architecture, the manipulation of vehicle controls
has been defined as consisting of both lateral and longitudinal
controls (e.g., Salvucci, 2006). The longitudinal control, or
speed control, is achieved through coordination between the
braking and acceleration operations, whereas lateral control
is achieved by the steering operation. The mutually dependent relation between the braking and acceleration operations
leads to an increase in their degrees of freedom. As a result,
the BCs of the braking and acceleration operations might decrease more than that of the steering operation. Moreover,
the velocity of the vehicle was mainly controlled by the gas
pedal and not by the braking operation, causing different BCs
for the braking and acceleration operations. In fact, as seen in
the examples of feature vectors presented in Figure 3 (a) and
(b), the frequency of the braking operation was substantially
lower than that of the acceleration operation. Even though the
participants typically controlled the vehicle velocity by using
the gas pedal, in some accidental situations, they also had to
press the brake to reduce the speed. As a result, the BC of
the braking operation was lower than that of the acceleration
operation.

Individuality and Behavioral Consistencies
In studies of driving behavior, an important research topic has
been to identify the uniqueness of individual driving behavior
in order to develop intelligent driver assistance systems customized for individual drivers. More specifically, identifying
an individual’s deviation from ideal behavior leads to predicting accidents and possibly preventing them (e.g., Igarashi et
al., 2004; Wakita et al., 2005; Okuda et al., 2009).
The results of our experiments imply that the braking and
acceleration operations are useful measures for identifying individual driver behavior because substantial differences were
noted between the inter- and intrapersonal BCs. On the other
hand, only a small difference was found in the steering op-

1448

eration because this operation was strongly regulated by the
environmental constraints. Our experiments suggest that considering the generality and individuality of the environmental
constraints in each operation is important when using behavioral data as personally identifying information.

Conclusion
In this research, we discussed the behavioral consistencies
(BCs) within multiple systems—real, virtual, and laboratory
systems—on a multi-layered experimental platform. The results showed that the BCs of the steering operation were the
highest, followed by those of the acceleration and braking
operations, respectively. The intrapersonal BCs (BCs within
individuals) of the braking and acceleration operations were
higher than the interpersonal BCs (BCs across individuals) in
all systems. Further, this tendency was consistent in all three
systems. In this paper, we discussed the behavioral consistencies within each system and the similarity of their tendencies
among the three different types of systems. These findings
lead to another research question: To what degree is human
behavior similar across the different types of systems when
comparing behavioral characteristics directly? This question
can be investigated in future studies.
