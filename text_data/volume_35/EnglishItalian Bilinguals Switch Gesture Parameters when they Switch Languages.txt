When the gesture stroke was produced in the central sector,
the gesture was annotated with 0 (not salient), whereas
when the gesture stroke was produced in the periphery
sector, the gesture was annotated with 1 (salient).
To ensure the reliability of the adopted coding scheme, a
subset of the corpus (659 gesture tokens) was annotated by
three independent coders. For gesture salience we found a
high agreement above the chance level (Kappa = 0.89).
                           Results
We analysed our data in a linear (for gesture frequency) and
a general (for gesture salience) mixed-effect model, as
implemented in the statistical package, R. The analysis was
run in R 2.15 using the package lme4, version 0.999999-0
(the function glmer was used for the gesture salience
analysis).
