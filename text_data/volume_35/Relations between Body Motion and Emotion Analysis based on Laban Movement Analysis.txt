                           Analysis
We analyzed the video data by applying LMA. Although the
LMA effort axes were quantiﬁed by Nakata and Mori (2002),
their method targeted pre-programed movements with param-
eters such as joint torque or angles of movement. Since our
study obtained data in uncontrolled situations, the method
from this previous study could not be directly applied. To
quantify the efforts of Weight, Space and Time, we used op-
tical ﬂows estimated by image processing.
   Weight effort is deﬁned as the following equation.
                              t     x   y
                                            ||vni j ||
                  Weight =   ∑ ∑ ∑ t ×x×y                       (1)     Figure 1: Subjective rating of emotional states after staying

where t, x, and y indicates the number of frames (25 fps),
the width of the frame (240px), and the height of the frame
(320px), respectively. ||vn jk || indicates the strength of the op-
tical ﬂow at pixel i j of frame n. Weight indicates the time
space average of the vector strength. If the participants moved
actively, this index would increase.
   The following equation deﬁnes Space effort.
                             t     x   y

                           n=1 i=1 j=1
where µn is a mean vector (by-center) of optical ﬂows in
frame n, which indicates overall direction of body movements
in the frame. Space is calculated as the time space average of
dot products between a mean vector and individual optical
ﬂows. This value would increase when optical ﬂows in the
frame had consistent direction. Conversely, the value would
decrease if direction of optical ﬂows diverged.                         Figure 2: Changes in the features of body movements while
