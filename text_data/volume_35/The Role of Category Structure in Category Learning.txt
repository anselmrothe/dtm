Methods
Participants Forty-two adults with normal or corrected to
normal vision participated in the experiment. In addition,
one participant was excluded from the analysis due to not
exceeding the learning criterion.
Stimuli & Procedure The stimuli and procedure were
identical to Experiment 1 except that dense categories were
used. In contrast to sparse categories, dense categories had
two category-relevant spatial dimensions instead of one (see
Figure 1c). For category A and B, in addition to the bottom-
right relevant dimension, the upper-left location had a
constant shape/color as the bottom-right location had. For
category C and D, in addition to the left location, the upper-
right location had a constant shape/color identical as the left
location.
Results
The overall accuracy for the test blocks was .98, SD = .11

effect or interactions (ps > .05). Moreover, there was no
significant difference between block 4 and block 5,
indicating the absence of cost.
