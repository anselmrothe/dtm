This paper (Kachergis & Yu, 2013) presents several
conditions in which the number of words and objects do not
match: either additional objects appear at random, or objects
appear sometimes without their intended words. These
manipulations do generally hurt learning in comparison to
balanced conditions, but people still learn a significant
proportion of word-object pairings. The results are explored
in terms of statistics of the training trials—including
contextual diversity and context familiarity—and with the
uncertainty- and familiarity-biased associative model.
Parametric differences between conditions hint at hidden
cognitive constructs.
