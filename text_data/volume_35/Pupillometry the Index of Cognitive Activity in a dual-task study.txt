the speed at which it moves (the bar then always travels at a
constant speed to a randomly determined destination on the
horizon), to create an easy and a difficult driving setting 2 .
   The linguistic stimuli (loosely based on Bader & Meng,
1999; see Example (1)) consisted of 40 locally ambiguous
subject and object relative clauses in German, where the rel-
ative pronoun die is ambiguous between nominative and ac-
cusative case. The following NP (einige der Mieter) is also
ambiguous between these cases. Accordingly, the relative
clause type (subject vs. object relative clause) is ambiguous
until the disambiguating verb (hat vs. haben) is encountered.

poral relationship between the movement of the reference bar
and any effect of this in the ICA or the overall pupil area, as
shown in Figure 4(b). We can see that there is a time-shifted
correlation between the movement of the reference bar and a
reaction which we can measure in the ICA, starting at about
700msec after a movement in the reference bar and peaking at
about 1.1 seconds after reference bar movement. This effect
is more pronounced in the difficult driving conditions than in

Figure 4(c) shows, there is however almost no discernible ef-

   These time series analyses are interesting because there
was previously no published information on how quickly to
expect an effect on the ICA. We however also don’t yet know
enough about what we actually see in the ICA: is it related
to the reference bar stimulus? or maybe rather an effect of
the action taken by the participant in the task? In order to
shed some light on this question, we also ran an autocorre-

   This adjusted alignment then allows us to enter these fac-
tors in regression and spline models. In a first analysis, we
tested whether the ICA is explained only by the speed of the
reference bar, or also by its acceleration. Figure 3 shows a
spline plot for a model including both reference bar velocity
and reference bar acceleration in fitting in turn left and right
ICA. The patterns are independent of the driving condition
(easy or difficult) and of the presence of language stimuli. We
see a roughly linear relationship between reference bar speed
and the ICA. The bottom plots of Figure 3 furthermore show
a u-shaped correlation between the acceleration of the refer-
ence bar and the ICA, indicating that the ICA is larger when
the reference bar starts moving or stops moving, and lower
when it is not moving or moving at its constant top speed.
ICA and the language task
The Effect of Language Figure 5 shows how the left and
right ICA and left and right overall pupil sizes evolve during
the phases of the experiment, which consist of approximately
two minutes of driving followed by four minutes of driving
and listening to speech and answering yes-no questions. The
speech signal consists of 10 blocks of one item, two fillers
and a yes-no question. The blocks are separated by a pause
of 2 seconds. It is very interesting to compare the pupil area
plots and the ICA plots: pupil area is large at the beginning
of a phase, but the pupil contracts soon afterwards. At the be-
ginning of the language phase, pupil dilation increases again,
which is what we expected, given the additional load of lan-         Figure 5: Spline plot (120 knots) for ICA and overall pupil
