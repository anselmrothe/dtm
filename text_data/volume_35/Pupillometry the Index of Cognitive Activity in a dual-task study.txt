Abstract
This paper reports experimental results on the index of cognitive activity (ICA), a recent micro-level measure in pupillometry, which relates processing load to the frequency of rapid
small dilations of the pupil. We collected pupil size during a
tracking task which was cast in a simulated driving context, as
well as for a dual task of simultaneous tracking and language
processing. The present results are the first to evaluate the ICA
measure on these tasks. We find that the ICA is sensitive both
to the simulated driving and the language task, and that it is
more responsive to our driving task than overall pupil dilation.
Overall, the use of the ICA as opposed to traditional pupillometry seems promising, as our data provide initial evidence
that the ICA may be more responsive, and a more fine-grained
measure of cognitive load than traditional macro-scale pupil
dilation measures.

Introduction
The size of the pupil has long been known to reflect arousal
(Hess & Polt, 1960) and cognitive load in a variety of different tasks such as arithmetic problems (Hess & Polt, 1964),
digit recall (Kahneman & Beatty, 1966), attention (Beatty,
1982) as well as language complexity (Schluroff, 1982; Just
& Carpenter, 1993; Hyönä, Tommola, & Alaja, 1995; Zellin,
Pannekamp, Toepel, & der Meer, 2011; Frank & Thompson,
2012), grammatical violations (Gutirrez & Shapiro, 2010)
and context integration effects (Engelhardt, Ferreira, & Patsenko, 2010). All of these studies have looked at the macrolevel effect of the overall dilation of the pupil as response to
a stimulus. Recently, another micro-level measure of pupil
dilation has been proposed, called the “Index of Cognitive
Activity” or ICA (Marshall, 2000, 2002, 2007), which does
not relate processing load to the overall changes in size of the
pupil, but instead counts the frequency of rapid small dilation,
which are usually discarded as pupillary hippus (Beatty &
Lucero-Wagoner, 2000). The ICA has been argued to be robust to changes in ambient light and eye-movements, and can
therefore be hoped to be more reliable and robust than overall pupil dilation. Furthermore, as it does not use the overall
dilation of the pupil which can vary as a function of lighting
and individual, the frequency of the rapid pupil dilations is
argued to be more comparable across tasks and subjects.
If it reliably reflects processing load, the ICA would be a
convenient method to assess processing load using an eyetracker, in naturalistic environments, e.g. while driving a car,
and could therefore usefully complement the range of experimental paradigms currently used.
To our knowledge, the present paper is the first to test its
response to a tracking task, and to analyze properties of the
Index of Cognitive Activity such as its response delay to a

stimulus. The application of the method in a realistic scenario (measuring linguistically induced cognitive load during
driving) also bears relevance for practical applications.

The Index of Cognitive Activity
The Index of Cognitive Activity is a patented measure of cognitive load which has previously only been evaluated on a
small range of tasks (Marshall, 2000, 2002, 2007; Schwalm,
2008; Schwalm, Keinath, & Zimmer, 2008) including digit
span tasks, and a simulated driving task. Using the ICA as
a measure of processing load is motivated by the finding that
pupil size can be affected by two different processes: lighting
conditions and cognitive activity. In the overall pupil dilation, these two effects are confounded, even in stable lighting
because there is a so-called “light reflex”, meaning that the
pupil oscillates irregularly and continually. Pupil dilation is
controlled by two groups of muscles: circular muscles, which
make the pupil contract and radial muscles, which make the
pupil dilate. Furthermore, we know that the activation and
inhibition patterns are different for reaction to light and reaction to cognitive activity (Marshall, 2000): dilations due
to cognitive activity are very short and abrupt, while pupil
size changes due to lighting are slower and larger. The ICA
therefore tries to disentangle these patterns by performing a
wavelet analysis on the pupil dilation record to remove all
large oscillations and retain only the very short and rapid
events (larger than a specified threshold), which are then attributed to the effect of cognitive activity.
The ICA events (rapid small dilations) per second are
counted, divided by the number of expected ICA events per
second (30), and the resulting number is then transformed
using the hyperbolic tangent function, in order to obtain a
number between zero and one1 . To obtain a continuous measure, blinks are factored out by linear interpolation of adjacent events. When using the EyeTracking.Inc software, an
ICA value per second is produced. To obtain finer granularity,
we also calculated a per-100-msec ICA value from the ICA
events (i.e. the rapid dilation events). Due to the short time
span, we could not interpolate for blinks (which take about
100msecs) and therefore simply excluded from our analysis
time all frames during which a blink or partial blink occurred.

Background on Pupillometry and the LC-NE area
It has been observed that pupil dilation is strongly correlated
with activity in the locus caeruleus (LC) region of the brain.

licensed from EyeTracking, Inc., San Diego, CA. For details see
(Marshall, 2000).

LC neurons is bilateral and emits the neuro-transmitter norepinephrine (NE) (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005; Laeng, Sirois,
& Gredebäck, 2012). The LC-NE system is known to be activated by stress and is thought to also have a role in memory
retrieval and memory consolidation. The activity of the LCNE system as reflected in pupil dilations can therefore be a
valuable method of inspecting cognitive load, and might be
particularly useful also in multi-tasking settings.

included 10 stimuli and 20 fillers, as well as 10 comprehension questions. The order of the stimuli was randomized. We
recorded pupil dilations on both eyes using the head-mounted
SR EyeLink II eyetracker at 250 Hz.

Data Analysis and Results
Methods All analyses reported below were done using the
lme4 (Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008) and mgcv (Wood,
2001) packages in R.

Experimental Setup
We conducted an experiment with 24 subjects, during which
participants had to simultaneously perform a tracking task as
well as a language comprehension task. We also collected
data for the tracking task in a single-task setting. Our tracking task was cast as a simulated driving task (“ConTRe task”,
(Mahr, Feld, Moniri, & Math, 2012)). The screen displays a
moving road with two periodically moving bars at the horizon. One of the bars moves randomly across the screen (“reference bar”), while the other bar is controlled by the subject
with a gaming steering wheel. The task of the participants is
to cover the reference bar with their “steering bar”, as exactly
as possible. Difficulty of the ConTRe task was manipulated
by changing the intervals at which the bar moves, as well as
the speed at which it moves (the bar then always travels at a
constant speed to a randomly determined destination on the
horizon), to create an easy and a difficult driving setting 2 .
The linguistic stimuli (loosely based on Bader & Meng,
1999; see Example (1)) consisted of 40 locally ambiguous
subject and object relative clauses in German, where the relative pronoun die is ambiguous between nominative and accusative case. The following NP (einige der Mieter) is also
ambiguous between these cases. Accordingly, the relative
clause type (subject vs. object relative clause) is ambiguous
until the disambiguating verb (hat vs. haben) is encountered.

The language stimuli were synthesized using the MARY textto-speech system (Schröder & Trouvain, 2003). Synthesized
stimuli were used to control the exact duration and timing of
stimuli and pauses, so that we could more easily align our
data for analysis. In particular, we made sure that the disambiguating region (hat / haben) was equally long in both
conditions, by manipulating the duration of the pause after
hat/haben. Furthermore, using synthesized speech avoids
problems with large differences in intonation.
Our experiment was conducted in four phases, between
which participants were offered to take a break. Each phase

speed was set to 40km/h in easy setting, 70km/h in the
difficult driving setting; maximal speed setting for reference bar in
easy setting was 1, and 2.5 in difficult setting; maximal speed setting
for steering bar was 2 in easy setting and 4 in difficult setting.

Distribution of the ICA Figure 1 shows the distribution of
the ICA calculated per second (top plot) and calculated for
a window of 100ms (bottom plot). While the aggregation is
smooth for the 1s window, there are only few possible distinct events in a 100msec window (the bumps correspond to
0 events, 1 event up to 5 ICA events). Due to the tanh transformation of the ratio between observed and expected ICA
events, the bulk of ICA values lies in a narrow range between
0.7 and 0.95 for the standard per-second aggregation.
The left and right ICA values are strongly correlated
with each other (Spearman’s rank correlation ρ = 0.71; p <
0.0001; per-second ICA), but clearly not identical.

Relationship between the ICA and pupil area Next, we
inspect the relationship between the ICA and the overall
pupil area. The correlation between these two measures are
small (left eye per-second ICA: τ = 0.105; p < 0.0001; and
right eye per-second ICA: τ = 0.0146; p < 0.01;). The autocorrelation plot in Figure 2 shows how dynamics of the two
measures differ (Figure 2 only shows the left eye but the
right eye looks very similar): while the ICA has little autocorrelation in the time-series analysis and changes dynamically, the overall pupil size has a high autocorrelation.

ICA and the ConTRe Driving Task
The reference bar moves periodically at a constant speed
(ca. every 4 seconds for 1-3 seconds in easy driving and every
2.5 seconds for .5 to 1 seconds in difficult driving). This periodicity can also be seen in the autocorrelation plots shown in

2155

Figure 2: Auto-correlations for the ICA and pupil area.
(a) Auto-correlation for the speed of the reference bar.

Figure 4(a). More interestingly, we can also inspect the temporal relationship between the movement of the reference bar
and any effect of this in the ICA or the overall pupil area, as
shown in Figure 4(b). We can see that there is a time-shifted
correlation between the movement of the reference bar and a
reaction which we can measure in the ICA, starting at about
700msec after a movement in the reference bar and peaking at
about 1.1 seconds after reference bar movement. This effect
is more pronounced in the difficult driving conditions than in
the easy driving conditions (these results hold both for the
driving only and the driving plus language conditions). As
Figure 4(c) shows, there is however almost no discernible effect of the reference bar movement on overall pupil dilation.
These time series analyses are interesting because there
was previously no published information on how quickly to
expect an effect on the ICA. We however also don’t yet know
enough about what we actually see in the ICA: is it related
to the reference bar stimulus? or maybe rather an effect of
the action taken by the participant in the task? In order to
shed some light on this question, we also ran an autocorrelation analysis for the ICA and the subject controlled steering bar. As Figure 4(d) shows, the correlation between the
ICA and the steering bar is stronger than the correlation between the ICA and the reference bar. As people moved the

steering bar as a reaction to the movement of the reference
bar, the latency of the ICA with respect to the steering bar is
also much smaller (starting right away and peaking at about
400msec). For further analysis, we re-aligned our measurements of the reference bar movement (shift by 1.3s) and steering bar movement (shift by 400msec) in order to align with
the ICA.

This adjusted alignment then allows us to enter these factors in regression and spline models. In a first analysis, we
tested whether the ICA is explained only by the speed of the
reference bar, or also by its acceleration. Figure 3 shows a
spline plot for a model including both reference bar velocity
and reference bar acceleration in fitting in turn left and right
ICA. The patterns are independent of the driving condition
(easy or difficult) and of the presence of language stimuli. We
see a roughly linear relationship between reference bar speed
and the ICA. The bottom plots of Figure 3 furthermore show
a u-shaped correlation between the acceleration of the reference bar and the ICA, indicating that the ICA is larger when
the reference bar starts moving or stops moving, and lower
when it is not moving or moving at its constant top speed.

ICA and the language task
The Effect of Language Figure 5 shows how the left and
right ICA and left and right overall pupil sizes evolve during
the phases of the experiment, which consist of approximately
two minutes of driving followed by four minutes of driving
and listening to speech and answering yes-no questions. The
speech signal consists of 10 blocks of one item, two fillers
and a yes-no question. The blocks are separated by a pause
of 2 seconds. It is very interesting to compare the pupil area
plots and the ICA plots: pupil area is large at the beginning
of a phase, but the pupil contracts soon afterwards. At the beginning of the language phase, pupil dilation increases again,
which is what we expected, given the additional load of language processing. Interestingly, this is not the case in the ICA
data: The ICA only goes down very little during the drivingonly phase, and is overall lower in the dual-task section than
in the single task section.
Another relevant observation is that we can observe 10
clear peaks in the ICA data, corresponding exactly to our 10
items. Such a relationship is not visible in the pupil area data
(which also shows some periodicity but without a clear correspondence to stimuli). In a linear mixed effects model including only data from the driving plus language phase with the
ICA as a response variable and two predictors (a flag whether
a sound file is playing and a flag indicating whether the driving condition was easy or difficult), we find that the ICA is
significantly higher when a sound file is being played than
when it is not (i.e., between stimuli), see Table 1.
In regressions with pupil area as a response variable,
whether the sound file is playing is a significant negative
predictor on both the left eye (coef= −0.058;t = −4.9; p >
0.001) and the right eye (coef= −0.067;t = −5.1; p > 0.001),
while the driving difficulty manipulation does not reach significance on either eye.

Figure 5: Spline plot (120 knots) for ICA and overall pupil
dilation as a function of the duration of the driving only followed by driving with language task.
Ambiguous Region Next, we would like to see whether the
ICA reflects in some way our critical region, i.e. whether we
see an effect to the relative clause ambiguity. To this end, we
run a spline model showing the development of the ICA during the duration of an item, with three predictor variables:
time-shifted steering bar velocity, time-shifted steering bar
acceleration and the distance from the critical region. Reference bar velocity does not explain any of the variance in the
ICA data once steering bar velocity has been included as a
predictor, therefore, our models include only the steering bar
data. Figure 6 shows that the ICA is relatively high during the
ambiguous region but starts falling right after disambiguation.
Disambiguating Region Note that the two relative clause
conditions are collapsed in Figure 6– but can we measure a
facilitation in the subject relative clause condition as opposed
to the object relative clause? We ran a mixed effects regres-

We found again that steering bar velocity is a better predictor of the ICA than reference bar velocity. For the left eye,
we find that steering bar velocity, steering bar acceleration,
phase time and our critical manipulation, the relative clause
type, are significant predictors. In particular, we find that the
left eye ICA is significantly lower when the item is a subject relative clause. We also find that the left ICA decrease
as a function of when the item is presented within a phase
(see also Figure 5). Additionally, we find a significant interaction between phase time and the relative clause condition,
which indicates that the difference in ICA between the subject and object relative clauses gets weaker as the experiment
proceeds – it is possible that this is a learning effect.
In the right ICA, we see similar tendencies, but, with the
exception of steering bar velocity, the predictors fail to significantly improve model fit. It should be noted though that this
finding replicates the finding of a language-only study using
the same relative clause stimuli, which also found a significant effect of relative clause type on the left eye’s ICA but
not on the right eye (Demberg, Kiagia, & Sayeed, 2013).
While we cannot find a significant main effect of relative
clause type in a regression with overall pupil size as a response variable, but we do find that the pupil size decreases
significantly more quickly in the subject relative clause condition than in the object relative clause condition (this holds
for both right eye (p < 0.01) and left eye (p < 0.05)).

Discussion and Conclusions
sion model with right and left ICA (in turn) as response variables and (time shifted) reference bar velocity and acceleration, (shifted) steering bar velocity and acceleration, relative
clause type, phase time (indicating how far into the phase the
measurement was taken) and driving difficulty as explanatory
variables. We also enter item and subject as random effects,
as well as a random slopes for relative clause condition under
item and subject.
The mixed effects models shown in Table 2 include data
from the time window of 100 msec till 1800 msec after the
onset of the critical region. Due to co-articulation, we expect
that differences of hat vs. haben should be audible from about
100msec after the onset, and given our finding of the 1.3s lag
between the reference bar movement and the ICA reaction,
the window up to 1.8s after the onset of the critical region
makes sure that we include the relevant part of the data in our
model.

In this paper, we have reported our first experimental results
on using the index of cognitive activity (ICA) as a measure
of cognitive load in a dual-task scenario. Our analysis results
show that the ICA and pupil dilation are rather different measures. They have a very low correlation to each other, and
also behave differently: the ICA is very dynamic, while pupil
dilation changes only slowly. This observation is particularly
interesting, as it indicates that the ICA might be used at higher
time resolution than overall pupil dilation.
The distribution of the ICA however also shows that there
are some limits as to how incrementally it can be used: When
calculating the ICA events at 100msec intervals, the distribution is not smooth, and there is little bandwidth of distinct
events (in our data we observe between 0 and 6 such rapid
movements per 100msec window).
The time series analyses reported here furthermore indicate
that the ICA is reflecting the ConTRe task steering events,

2158

while no such effect is detectable in pupil area. The autocorrelation analyses also allowed us to understand more about
the delay between stimulus and effect in the ICA: there is
a lag of about 1.2s between the movement of the reference
bar and an effect in the ICA, and a lag of about 400msec between the subject’s steering action and the ICA. The fact that
the correlation of the ICA and the steering bar is larger than
the correlation with the reference bar indicates that the ICA
might be related to the participants action execution (as opposed to their perception of the steering task). This is also
confirmed by mixed effects regression models with the ICA
as a response variable and re-aligned steering bar and reference bar velocity as predictors: the reference bar velocity predictor variable does not improve model fit over models which
already include steering bar velocity.
Furthermore, we find that the ICA record reflects our secondary task, language comprehension. In a more detailed
analysis, we find that the ICA is significantly higher within
the dual task condition whenever the language stimulus is
not playing, and that the ICA is high during the ambiguous
region of our language stimulus and decreases following disambiguation. We also find a significant effect of our language
manipulation, showing that the ICA of the left eye is significantly higher in the object relative clause condition than in
the subject relative clause condition.
We also compare the ICA measure to traditional overall
pupil dilation and find that our primary tracking task is not reflected in pupil dilation. For our language manipulation, the
results in overall pupil dilation are consistent with our findings in the ICA: in the subject relative clause condition, the
pupil contracts significantly faster than in the object relative
clause condition.
