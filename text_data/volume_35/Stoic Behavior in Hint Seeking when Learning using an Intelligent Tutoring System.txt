   In this study, we investigate the following two research
questions: Do students exhibit stoic behavior in hint seeking
when learning with an intelligent tutoring system in class-
room settings? and does such stoic behavior in hint seeking
promote learning gains? We examined these research ques-
tions through three empirical studies.

keeping-off behavior in help-seeking. We will investigate the
self-fading behavior in Experiment 3.
   Experiment 1 was a preliminary experiment. Experiment 1
was performed in a laboratory setting; Experiments 2 and 3
were performed in a real classroom setting.
Participants and Procedure
Thirty-three participants joined Experiment 1. In the initial
phase of the experiment, the participants learned the basics
of ND through handout materials and an instructional video.
They learned eight inference rules and four strategies without
the tutoring system. After the participants were instructed on

six example problems with our tutoring system through the
80-min learning phase. Two of the problems were difficult
and required a second-order subproof, and two were easy and
either did not require a subproof or required only a first-order
subproof. The data recoreded in this phase were analyzed.
Results
We focused on two kinds of help control behavior. One is a
relatively simple behavior. In our experiments, participants
were allowed to solve problems at their own pace. Some par-
ticipants quit solving a problem, moved to other problems,
and then revisited the initial problem and attempted to com-
plete it. Our first hypothesis is that participants in the second

test problem; we used this test as a pretest in the following
analysis.
   The log data from the third lesson were analyzed. The
participants solved eight problems at their own paces and se-
lected an LOS. Three of the eight problems were easily solved
by applying the basic rules learned in the first lesson. How-
ever, three problems were relatively difficult, and their so-
lutions required more complex rules and solution strategies,
such as subgoal settings. The learning session lasted for an         Figure 6: Levels of support versus learning gains in Experi-
