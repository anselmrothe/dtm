Pupillometry For the ICA, we find a main effect of driv-
ing difficulty in the ICA of the right eye, but not in the left
eye (Table 1). Furthermore, we find significantly more blinks
during the phases when language was playing. In-depth anal-
ysis of the pupillometric data reveals that overall dilation
was larger when people were listening to language stimuli,
but the number of ICA events was lower (Figure 3). If we
look into the language phase, however, the ICA of both eyes
went down significantly whenever language wasn’t playing
(e.g., between stimuli; Table 1: we factored out the effect of
blinks or partial blinks on both the pupil area calculations and
the ICA). This effect can also be seen in Figure 3, where the
10 ICA spikes in the language region coincide with our 10
blocks of language stimuli.
                                                                      Figure 3: Spline plots (120 knots; with 0.95 conf intervals)

ductance measuring device was removed between phases, and
comparison of absolute values between phases is thus impos-
sible. A measure that can be compared between driving con-
ditions is however the number of skin conductance events.
When running a linear mixed effects regression model with
this measure as a response variable, we find that more such
skin conductance events happened, as expected, in the diffi-
cult driving condition, see Table 2.
   We do however not find any significant effect of the lan-
guage vs. no language condition on this measure. Unexpect-
edly, we find that tonic skin conductance is lower in the driv-             Figure 4: SCR during time that stimulus is spoken.
