rial structure in the world’s languages. Moreover, given that
the route from high transparency to combinatoriality is more
indirect, it seems likely that combinatoriality takes longer to
arise in systems that afford highly transparent signs. This may
explain why ABSL still exhibits so little combinatoriality.
Investigating combinatoriality in the laboratory
It is very rare for linguists to have the opportunity to observe
and record a new language in its early stages, making such in-        Figure 1: Screenshot from early stage of game. The screen on

would play as “sender” and the other as “receiver”. The

this referent to the receiver so that the receiver could select
