                           Abstract
    Chess experts remember meaningful chess positions bet-
    ter than novices (de Groot, 1978; Chase & Simon,
    1973). This can be explained with a larger number
    of chunks in experts’ long-term memory (Gobet & Si-
    mon, 1998). These chunks are mainly based on visual
    representations—that is, pieces on squares. However,
    a recent experiment highlighted that experts prefer to
    group chess positions by abstract similarities that can-
    not be explained purely visually (Linhares & Brum,
    2007). Based on these data it was claimed that chess
    expertise, in addition to chunks, crucially relies on ab-
    straction and analogies. These data and the conclusions
    were heavily criticized because the instructions strongly
    biased the participants to group positions in a certain        Figure 1: The left panel shows the game Rosentalis-

abstract-level relations and analogies are more impor-
tant for understanding expert performance (Linhares &
Brum, 2007). Chess experts excel because their repre-
sentations are on a high level of abstraction and these
representations are not explainable by chunking alone.
   In other areas of expertise it is well established that

concentrate on superficial aspects. Chi, Feltovich, and

perts grouped problems based on physical, non-obvious
principles (conservation of energy vs conservation of mo-
mentum). Inspired by this work, Linhares and Brum
(2007) constructed a set of chess positions that could be
grouped either by superficial, visual similarity or based
on abstract principles. In their experiment they showed
subjects 20 positions that formed 10 pairs based on 10
abstract ideas, like “material gain due to a double at-
tack” or “endgame with bishops of the same color.”
These pairs are fairly natural as they consist of well-
established categories in chess. Importantly, they con-       Figure 2: Four of the positions presented in the experi-
