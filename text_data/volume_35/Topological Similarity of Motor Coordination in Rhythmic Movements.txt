hypothesis views motor control underlying human
movements as a set of dynamical systems, that is, a
sequence of interactions between elements involved in
controlling movements such as body joints, muscles, neural
systems, etc. Our hypothesis can be best understood in the
context of the dynamical system perspective on the motor
coordination (Shaw et al., 1996; Turvey, 1998; Smith &
Thelen, 2003). The properties retained in dynamical systems
for long term can be captured with invariant measures such
as attractor dimension or Lyapnov exponent (Kantz &
Schreiber, 1997).
   We define a higher dimensional space, i.e., phase space,
within which all possible combinations between elements
involved in controlling movements can be found. An action
is then defined as a trajectory on the space. Trajectories can        Figure 1: Phase space of (a-1) the Hennon map, (a-2) the

as well. Importantly, it is easier to compute similarity
between two symbolic spaces than that between two high-
dimensional phase spaces. This mathematical property is
applied in our data analysis. By estimating the symbolic
dynamics for each of the samba attractors, we estimated the
probability of state space transition on the estimated
symbolic space (Figure 4). Each of the top left two-by-two
panels shows a probabilistic distribution (stationary
distribution) of the symbolic states for each musician and
condition. Each symbolic state is defined by a binary
symbol series of length 5 (e.g., “01100”), and the
distribution over its 32 possible states is shown in the figure.
   In Figure 4, we show the analysis concerning a pair of
musicians and conditions as representative results. Each
distribution of symbolic states reflects the topological nature
of the underlying dynamical systems – transitivity or
connectivity of states in the system. As shown in Figure 4,             Figure 3: The reconstructed phase space embedding in

   As a baseline comparison, we performed cross correlation

axis of the 3D motions with the most variance). By taking a
time lag maximizing correlation, the average cross
correlation was 0.453 across musicians and trials (0.462
across musicians (the same tempo) and 0.478 across tempos
(the same musicians)). These results showed the temporal
correlation of the shaker movements were not as high as the
correlation of the symbolic state space (0.831) even with the
time lag optimally adjusted and the playing tempo being
held constant. This result means that the similarity of
movements as physical properties cannot explain the
topological similarities shown above.                                Figure 4: Stationary distributions of states in each of

systems) the actions have. In other words, this is to abstract
the actions from their physical properties. In order to test the
hypothesis, we investigated the samba playing action, which
is repetitive rhythmic movement. The samba rhythm
fluctuates within a certain range, showing a complex accent
pattern, even if an auditory cue is given to keep the tempo
constant (Figure 2). No common property was found in
movements across musicians in physical movements of the
right arm.
   Subsequently, we analyzed the same data from a
perspective of actions as dynamical systems. In the analysis,
we define a higher dimensional space in which the action is
mapped as a trajectory. We analyzed time-delay vectors,
which embed the time series of movements, i.e., lower                    Figure 5: A drawing by the expert in his introspective
