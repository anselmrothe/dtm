Abstract

Porcelli and Delgado (2009) argue that stress enhances
decision biases such as the reflection effect (i.e., people
are more risk seeking in the loss domain than in the gain
domain, Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). In the current
research we follow up on this result, suggesting that stress
enhances preexisting preferences for risk. That is, in
decision situations in which people usually are risk
seeking, they should become even more risk seeking
under stress, whereas in decision situations in which
people behave risk averse, they should become even more
risk averse. We test these hypotheses in a financial risktaking task.
As a second goal we aimed to examine the mechanism
underlying changes in risky decision making under stress.
One mechanism by which stress could enhance
preexisting preferences is by narrowing the focus of
attention to the piece of information that is considered as
most important. In line with this idea stress has been
shown to reduce cognitive resources and narrow the focus
of attention as well as the amount of information that can
be processed (Friedman & Förster, 2010; Kelly, Ashleigh,
& Beversdorf, 2007; Wichary & Rieskamp, 2011). Thus,
stress could influence risky decision making by changing
the amount of attention given to the attributes of the
choice options such as the possible outcomes (gains or
losses) and the probability of the outcome (Ben Zur &
Breznitz, 1981).

Many decisions under risk and uncertainty are made under
physical or emotional stress. Recent research suggests that
stress influences decisions between risky options, but that
the direction of the influence depends on the characteristics
of the gambles. For instance, stress increases risk taking for
loss gambles, but decreases risk taking for gain gambles. In
the current project we investigate: (1) whether the riskiness
of gambles influences the direction of the stress effect and
(2) whether changes in risk taking can be linked to changes
in attention. Participants who gave relatively more
attention to gains than to losses, as indicated by eyetracking data, were more risk seeking than participants who
gave less attention to gains. Stress did not influence
participants’ attention. However, stressed participants
became more risk seeking when considering gambles with
relatively low risk, but less risk seeking for gambles with
relatively high risk.

Introduction
Every day we make decisions involving risk and
uncertainty ranging from buying a gamble ticket to
investing in stocks, gold, or real estate. Many of these
decisions are not made in cold blood, but under physical
or emotional stress. How stress and stress-related release
of hormones such as cortisol influence risk preferences,
however, is far from clear. Research has found that men,
but not women, tend to become more risk seeking under
stress (Lighthall, Mather, & Gorlick, 2009; Preston,
Buchanan, Stansfield, & Bechara, 2007; Starcke, Wolf,
Markowitch, & Brand, 2008). Similarly, studies on
financial risk taking have found divergent results. For
instance, offering participants choices between risky and
relatively safe options, Porcelli and Delgado (2009) found
that participants became more risk seeking under stress
when choosing between options involving losses, but less
risk seeking when choosing between options involving
gains. In a similar vein, Carr and Steele (2010) found that
stereotype threat reduced risk taking in women. Von
Dawans, Fischbacher, Kirschbaum, Fehr, & Heinrichs
(2012), however, found no influence of stress on
decisions between gambles involving gains and losses.

Variability in Outcomes as a Measure of Risk
The vast majority of research on financial risk taking
involves the choice between gambles; that is, options with
various outcomes that occur with a specific probability
and that differ in valence (e.g., gains or losses). The risk
of a gamble is commonly defined by the variability of the
outcomes, with higher variability implying higher risk.
For instance, finance models such as the capital-assespricing model equate risk with outcome variance (Sharpe,
1964). However, other variability measures such as the
coefficient of variation, a measure based on the relative
variance of a gamble, have been proposed to measure risk
(Weber, Shafir, & Blais, 2004). In sum, if stress amplifies
people’s risk preferences by narrowing their attention to
the subjectively important aspect of the decision situation,

then stress should lead to more risk-taking behavior for
gambles with little outcome variability and to less risk
taking for gambles with high outcome variability.

sufficient sample size in the stress condition. 48 were
females. Participants received a participation fee of 20
CHF per hour (approx. 22 US-$). Additionally one of the
participant’s decisions was randomly chosen and the
preferred gamble was played. Participants received/paid
10% of the gamble’s outcome. One participant was
excluded from the analysis because he always chose the
reference gamble. Overall, testing took 1 h and 30 min.

Attention in Risky Decision Making
The attention given to positive and negative attributes is
an important predictor of decisions under risk. For
instance, Ben Zur and Breznitz (1981) found that how
often people looked at information about how much they
could win or lose was related to their choices. This
suggests that if stress narrows attention to the information
the participant considers most important, increase in risky
choices could be related to more attention being given to
gains than to losses, whereas choice of safe options may
be related to increased attention to losses over gains.
A non-intrusive way of measuring the relative attention
given to gains or losses is by recording eye movements.
In general, visual attention is strongly coupled to eye
movements (e.g., Hoffman, 1998) and has been
successfully used to understand the processes underlying
decision making (Glaholt & Reingold, 2011). In
particular, two measures of eye movement have been
successfully used to predict decisions. First, the time
spent looking at an option is positively related to choosing
this option (Glaholt, Wu, & Reingold, 2009). Similarly,
the time spent looking at specific pieces of information
has been linked to the importance assigned to it (Rehder
& Hoffman, 2005). Secondly, choices are often reflected
by gaze cascade effects; that is, over time attention
wanders to the preferred option (Glaholt & Reingold,
2011; Fiedler & Glöckner, 2012). In particular, the last
focus is related to choice; that is, the option fixated last
before making a decision is chosen more frequently than
other options (Krajbich, Armel, & Rangel, 2010). Thus in
the current study, we considered the time that gains and
losses were looked at as well as the last information that
was fixated before making a decision.

Financial Decision-Making Task. The financial
decision-making task consisted of 40 decisions between
two gambles. In each trial participants chose between a
reference gamble (Gamble A), in which participants could
win 15 Swiss Francs (CHF) or lose 5 CHF with a
probability of .5 (EV = 5 CHF), and a target gamble
(gamble B). The reference gamble was the same in each
decision, but there were 40 different target gambles
structured in two sets: (1) high outcome gambles (e.g.,
win/lose 60 with a probability of .5) and (2) low outcome
gambles (e.g., win/lose 30 with a probability of .5). For
each gamble type (high or low outcome) we created sets
of gambles by varying the expected value of the target
gamble from -5 to 15/30 in steps of 5. The expected value
was varied by changing either (1) the amount that could
be won, (2) the amount that could be lost, or (3) the
probability with which each outcome could occur (see
Table 1 for an overview).

The Study
We investigated the influence of stress on risk taking
with a financial decision-making task consisting of 40
decisions between two gambles that contained positive
and negative outcomes. Mixed gambles present an
interesting problem, because increased risk taking with
cortisol has been shown in particular when high gains and
high losses were at stake (Putman, Antypa, Crysovergi,
& van der Does, 2010). Within the 40 gambles we varied
the variability in the outcomes.

Method
Participants. 70 participants (40 in the stress condition
and 30 in the no stress condition, MAge = 24.4, SDAge =
5.3) were recruited at the University of Basel. We
expected that for a substantial number (approximately one
third) of the participants the cold pressor task would not
result in an increase in cortisol. Therefore we collected
more participants in the stress condition, to ensure a

Procedure. After participants arrived we determined
whether they met the inclusion criteria for the study and
gave them approximately 8 fl. oz. of water to drink. Then,
we took the first saliva sample and measured mood and
arousal (T1). Following the measurements, participants
immediately proceeded with the first session of the
financial decision-making task. After that participants
gave the second saliva sample and again completed the
mood and arousal measures (T2). Next, participants
proceeded with the stress manipulation. 15 min after the
stress manipulation, so that cortisol levels had time to
rise, we took the third saliva sample and measured mood
and arousal (T3). Immediately afterwards, participants
performed the financial decision-making task again
(Session 2). After that we again measured mood and
arousal and took the fourth saliva sample (T4). Figure 2
provides a schematic overview of the experimental
design.

Note: p(win) = probability of receiving the positive
outcome (Gain); p(loss) = probability of receiving the
negative outcome (Loss). EV = gamble’s expected value.
The order in which the target gambles were presented
was randomized. For half of the participants gains
appeared on the left side and for the other half on the right
side. Reference and target gambles were presented
sequentially to allow better measures of the relative
attention given to each attribute (win, loss, probability) of
each gamble (see Figure 1 for a screenshot). Each trial
started with a fixation cross (100ms). Then the reference
gamble was presented until participants pressed the return
key. The target gamble appeared until participants made a
choice by pressing “1” for the reference gamble or “2” for
the target gamble. The task was implemented in

Eye Movements. We recorded participants’ eye
movements while they solved the financial decisionmaking task by using a remote eye-tracking device
(SensoMotorics Instruments LLC), using the iViewX
software and a remote binocular sampling rate of 120Hz.
The stimulus material was presented on a screen with a
resolution of 1680×1050 pixels and a refresh rate of 60Hz.
The eye tracker was calibrated before the decisionmaking task and calibration was checked and if necessary
repeated after each decision (20 pixel tolerance). Further
analysis was done in Matlab. Fixations were identified
using a 20 pixel tolerance (i.e., added max-min deviation
for x- and y-coordinates) and a minimum fixation time
threshold of 50 ms (see Fiedler & Glöckner, 2012 for a
similar procedure).
We defined areas of interest (AOI) as circles with a
radius of 120 pixels around each piece of information;

Stress Manipulation. In the stress condition, we
induced stress with the cold pressor task (CPT; Lovallo,
1975). The CPT is a standard method to induce a stress
response and has been shown to reliably increase
subjective stress and cortisol levels (McRae et al., 2006).
In the CPT participants immersed their right hand in ice
water (0° – 4° C, M = 1.86° C, SD = 0.67) for as long as
possible, up to 3 minutes. In the no stress condition
participants immersed their hand in warm water (37° –
40° C, M = 38.98° C, SD = 0.81).
Measurement of Mood, Arousal, and Stress. We
measured mood and arousal with the Self Assessment
Mannequins (SAM; Hodes, Cook, & Lang, 1985). To
measure the physiological stress response we took saliva
samples collected using Salivettes (Sarstedt, Nuembrecht,
Germany) to determine cortisol levels. Saliva samples

option with the higher expected value should have chosen
the target gamble in 67.5% of the trials). In a first step we
analyzed whether stress influenced the proportion of risky
choices with a mixed ANOVA with session (before/after
the stress induction) as within-subject factor and stress
condition as between-subjects factor. We did not find a
main effect of session (F(1,67) = 0.89, p = .35) or stress
(F(1,67) = 0.43, p = .51), nor an interaction between them
(F(1,67) = 0.10, p = .75; for means and SD see Table 3).
In the next step we tested whether the difference in
outcomes of the gambles influenced how stress affected
risky decision making. We focused on the choices where
target gambles offered a higher expected value than the
reference gamble (i.e., EV>10), to account for
participants’ overall risk aversion. A mixed ANOVA with
session and gamble type as within-subject factors and
stress condition as between-subjects factor showed that
participants chose the target gamble more frequently for
the low outcome gambles than the high outcome gambles,
F(1,67) = 70.96, p < .001. Additionally we found a threeway interaction between stress condition, session and
gamble type, F(1,67) = 5.87, p = .02. As illustrated in
Figure 3, repeated measurement ANOVAs for stressed
and not stressed participants separately showed an
interaction between time and gamble type for participants
in the stress condition, F(1,39) = 7.53, p = .01, but not in
the no stress condition, F(1,28) = 0.76, p = .39. This
suggests that in the second session compared to the first
session participants in the stress condition—but not
participants in the no stress condition—took more risks
with low outcome gambles, but less risk with high
outcome gambles.

Mixed analyses of variance (ANOVAs) on mood,

within-subject factor and stress condition as betweensubjects factor showed that arousal and cortisol levels
increased in the stress group but not in the no stress

decreased, suggesting that participants’ initial excitement
decreased during participation. This was indicated by

The Influence of Stress on Decisions under Risk. We
measured risk taking as the proportion of trials in which
the risky option (i.e., the target gamble) was chosen. On
average participants chose the risky option in 44% of the
choices in the first session and in 46% in the second
session, indicating that participants were rather risk averse
(a risk neutral decision maker who always chose the

Because previous literature has shown that men and
women react differently to stress (e.g., Lighthall et al.,
2009), we ran additional analyses including gender as a
further between-subjects factor. We found a main effect

frequently than men (Mmen = .79, SE = .05, Mwomen = .63,

last fixation before making a decision also showed no
main effects of session, gamble type or stress condition
(all ps > .45), but indicated a significant interaction
between gamble type and stress condition, F(1,67) = 4.09,
p = .05.
Follow-up analyses for participants in the stress
condition and the no stress condition separately showed
an effect of gamble type in the no stress condition,
F(1,28) = 4.24, p = .05, indicating that the participants
more frequently looked to gains compared to losses for
the low outcome gambles than for the high outcome
gambles (see Table 3). In the stress condition, however,
we did not find an effect of session or gamble type (all ps
> .37).

Eye Movements. Can the influence of stress on risktaking be explained by the relative attention given to
gains and losses? To answer this question, we considered
two measures of eye movements: (1) the relative duration
with which gains were fixated compared to losses
(FixationGainLoss) and (2) the relative proportion of
trials on which the last fixation before making a decision
was to the gain information or the loss information
(LastGainLoss). We calculated the measures for high and
low outcome gambles separately. Because the reference
gamble was always the same, we focused on the target
gambles. The FixationGainLoss was calculated by
measuring the duration of fixations in each AOI (gains,
losses and probabilities) for each trial. Next, we computed
how long gains were fixated relative to losses and
calculated the average for trials with high and low
outcome gambles with an expected value of 10 or higher.
The LastGainLoss was calculated by taking the difference
between the proportion of trials with high and low
outcome gambles with an expected value of 10 or higher
in which the last focus was to the gain AOI relative to the
loss AOI; see Table 3 for means and SD.
We then investigated whether the two measures of eye
movements were related to the proportion of risky
choices. Correlations indicated that the longer gains were
fixated compared to losses and the more often the last
fixation was to the gain AOI relative to the loss AOI, the
more participants chose the risky option, particularly in
the high outcome gambles (see Table 4).
To investigate whether the attention to gains and losses
changed with stress, we conducted two mixed ANOVAs
with session and variance as within-subject factors and
stress condition as between-subjects factor.
We did not find an effect of session, stress condition or
variance for the relative time gains and losses were

Discussion
The effect of stress on decisions under risk seems to
depend on the risk the decision involves. Whereas we did
not find an overall influence of stress on Although taking,
a detailed analysis showed that the influence of stress
depended on the variability in the gambles’ outcomes.
After immersing their hand in ice-cold water, participants
chose the risky gamble more frequently when the
difference between outcomes was relatively low, but less
frequently when the difference between outcomes was
high. This suggests that the influence of stress on risk
taking depends on the riskiness of the decision-making
task, resonating with research showing that stress
increases risk taking in the loss domain but decreases risk
taking the gain domain (Porcelli & Delgado, 2009). These
results can help reconcile the diverse effects of stress on
risky decision making in the literature by showing that to
understand the influence of stress it is necessary to take
task characteristics such as the involved risk of a decision
into account.
A second goal of the research was to investigate
whether the relative attention given to gains and losses is
a potential mechanism underlying the influence of stress.
Overall, participants who gave relatively more attention to
gains than to losses tended to choose the risky option
more frequently. This resonates with previous work
suggesting that the time spent on information is related to
its importance for the choice (e.g., Ben Zur & Breznitz,

1550

1981; Glaholt et al., 2009). Additionally we found that the
last fixation before making a choice was related to risk
taking, dovetailing with research on gaze cascade effects
in risky decision making (e.g., Fiedler & Glöckner, 2012).
Moreover, it suggests that gaze cascade effects extend to
the attribute that was most important in determining
choice.
We did not find any evidence, however, that stress
changed the relative attention given to gains over losses
or the last information looked at. This could suggest that
the influence of stress is not mediated by the attention
given to gains and losses. On the other hand, the effect of
stress could have been masked by noise given to the
relatively few gambles in our task.
In sum, our results suggest that stress changes how
risky decisions are made. Although the mechanism by
which stress exerts its influence requires further research,
it becomes clear that the effect of stress can only be
understood when considering the characteristics of the
decision task.
