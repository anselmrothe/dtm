draws their attention to shared commonalities. For example,
when two objects are given the same name, children will
extend this common name to new objects that share the
same perceptual features with the named exemplars (e.g.,
Samuelson & Smith, 1999). Importantly, these findings
demonstrate that exposing children to multiple, variable
exemplars labeled with a common, novel name allows
children to detect the similarities between objects and
therefore facilitates categorization.
    However, it remains unclear whether comparison
facilitates children’s ability to retain category names
because the existing studies on the effect of presenting
multiple category exemplars on word learning have focused
largely on generalization. For example, in a longitudinal
category training study, toddlers who encountered multiple
perceptually variable exemplars experienced a significant
acceleration in vocabulary growth and were able to                                  Figure 1: Novel stimuli
