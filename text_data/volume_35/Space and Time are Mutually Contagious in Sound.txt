the playback sound. In this second part of each trial, the
playback sound provided the medium for the participant’s
response. The playback sound began in the final location of
the preceding target sound and moved in the reverse
direction. So, if a target sound moved rightward, the
playback sound moved leftward, and vice versa. On
distance trials, participants were instructed to respond when
the playback sound reached the start location of the target
sound, thereby reproducing the distance from head to start
point. In this manner, the participant’s head provided a
fixed reference point for judging distance. On duration
trials, participants were instructed to respond when the
playback sound duration was equal to the target sound
duration. The playback sound lasted for a fixed 8500ms and
moved 3.5m past the starting location of the target sound or
until the participant responded. The playback sounds were
designed in such a manner as to allow participants the
possibility to both overshoot and undershoot their estimates.
Participants heard each target sound in both duration and
distance conditions for a total of 162 trials.
                                  Results
The results (Fig. 1) demonstrate that actual durations
affected estimates of spatial displacement (Fig. 1A: y =
0.0002x + 1.4208, r2 = .98, df = 7, p < .01) and that actual
spatial displacement affected estimates of duration (Fig. 1B:
y = 128.97x + 2532.8, r2 = .88, df = 7, p < .01). On distance
trials, for stimuli of the same average duration (3000ms),
sounds shorter in length were judged to be of shorter
duration, and sounds longer in length were judged to be of
longer duration. On duration trials, for stimuli of the same
average displacement (2.5m) sounds of shorter durations
were judged to be shorter in length, and sounds of longer
durations were judged to be longer in length. Time and
space were mutually contagious in that irrelevant
information in the task-irrelevant domain affected
participants’ estimates of both duration and spatial
displacement.           Compatible effects were found using
multiple regression analyses. Duration was significantly
correlated with distance judgments even when variance
associated with each trial’s actual distance was removed
[ρr(81) = .81; p < .01]. Distance was significantly
correlated with duration judgments when variance
associated with actual duration was removed [ρr(81) = .64;
p < .01]. There was no effect of direction (left-moving vs.
right moving trials).
