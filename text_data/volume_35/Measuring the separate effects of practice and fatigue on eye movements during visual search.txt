Procedure Each participant received 600 trials which were
divided into 12 blocks of 50 trials. Eye tracking calibration
was conducted before each block. Additionally, drift
correction was conducted every 10 trials. Each target letter
appeared in 25% of the target present displays. The displays
were randomized for each participant. The visual search
task consisted of the search for one of the target letters
amongst either 6 or 13 distractor letters. Trials began with a
500 ms display indicating the target to be searched for on
that trial, followed by a blank screen for 200 ms and then
the search display. The participants were instructed to
search for the target letter and press the right button on a
gamepad if the target was present and the left button if the
target was absent. The display remained on the screen until               Figure 1: Change in RT as a function of Block relative to
