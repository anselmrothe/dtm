Abstract
Two experiments were conducted to examine how time-ontask (i.e., practice and fatigue) influences eye movements
during visual search. In Experiment 1, we examined how
practice influences eye movements during an extended visual
search task. Results replicate the findings that over the course
of a visual search task, performance improves and fixation
duration increases. Yet changes in fixation duration did not
correlate with changes in search performance. In Experiment
2, we examined how fatigue influences eye movements
during an extended visual search task. To manipulate fatigue,
participants either did or did not receive breaks. Those who
did not receive breaks replicated the findings in Experiment 1.
Critically, participants who did receive breaks showed no
increase in fixation duration over the course of the visual
search task. These results indicate that the increase in fixation
duration with time-on-task reflects fatigue, and that this
measure of fatigue can be derived independent of measures of
performance improvements, such as shorter response times.
Keywords: Visual Search, Attention, Practice, Fatigue, Eye
Movements.

Previous research (Horowitz, Cade, Wolfe & Czeisler,
2003; Wolfe et al, 2007) has shown that after long passages
of time, critical items are missed during visual search. Given
that many studies have shown that fatigue negatively
impacts the ability to allocate attention across a broad
spectrum of tasks (Casagrande, Violani, Curcio & Bertini,
1997; Dawson & Reid, 1997; Drumer & Dinges, 2005;
Fairclough & Graham, 1999; Lyznicki, Doege, Davis &
Williams, 1998; Marcus & Loughlin, 1996; Williamson &
Feyer, 2000), it is reasonable to think that the fatigue which
arises over time while engaging on a task contributes to
search performance failures over time. Fatigue can be
manifested in a number of different ways. For example,
fatigue is considered to result from working (e.g., Winwood,
Winefield, & Lushington, 2006), mental stress (Baumeister,
2002), psychopathology (Berrios, 1990), boredom (Wyatt &

Langdon, 1937), disease (Whitehead, 2009), and lack of
sleep (Durmer, & Dinges, 2005). In the present context, we
refer to the fatigue that is associated with time-on-task (e.g.,
Neri, et al., 2002; Stern, et al., 1993; Wilkinson, 1961).
Pinpointing the role of fatigue on search performance is
inherently challenging, given that a) the negative effect of
fatigue overlaps with the positive effect of practice on a
task, and b) the same behavioural measures (e.g., response
time, RT) are used to assess both the positive and negative
effects of time on task. Further, several studies have found
that RT measures are actually insensitive to fatigue (Baulk,
Reyner & Horne, 2001; Gillberg, Kecklund & Akerstedt,
1996; Milosevic, 1997). Utilizing the fact that fatigue
appears to influence oculomotor control (Bocca & Denise,
2006; De Gennaro, Ferrara, Urbani & Bertini, 2000; Galley
1989; Galley & Galley, 1998; Hoffman, 1946; Luckiesh &
Moss, 1937; Morris & Miller 1996; Saito, 1992; Schleicher,
Galley, Briest & Galley, 2008; Sirevaag & Stern 2000;
Stern, Boyer, & Schroeder, 1994; Summala, Häkkänen,
Mikkola, & Sinkkonen, 1999), and could lead to an increase
in fixation duration, the present paper investigated the
intriguing possibility that fixation duration could provide an
index of fatigue over time that is separable from the
beneficial effects of practice on a task.
To achieve this aim, in two experiments the eye
movements and performance of individuals were monitored
as they performed a visual search task. Experiment 1
confirmed that changes in fixation duration are not
correlated with the improvements in search that come from
practice. Experiment 2 manipulated levels of fatigue, and
showed that as fatigue levels increased, so did fixation
duration, and that this could be separated and measured
reliably from the positive effects that practice has on search
performance. Collectively these data provide evidence that
eye movements can be used as an indicator of fatigue that is

2820

independent of other performance changes, in particular, the
positive performance changes that accompany practice.

(4.5%). The remaining analyses were conducted on the
correct responses only. Each measure was analyzed using an
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Target Presence
(present vs. absent), Set Size (7 vs. 14 items), and Block (1
to 12) as within participant factors. We report all significant
main effects and interactions. Because the focus of the study
relates directly to time-on-task, we focus on the main effect
of block and its interactions with other variables.

Experiment 1
Participants performed a standard attentionally demanding
visual search task, whereby search time increases with set
size, and indicating that a target is absent takes longer than
reporting a target’s presence (Wolfe, 1998). An SR
Research EyeLink 1000 desktop mount eye tracking system
measured fixation duration.

Performance Change in RT is plotted as a function of block
(i.e., practice) in Figure 1. For RT, there was a main effect
of Target Presence, F(1, 11) = 84.29, MSE = 809646.70, p <
.001, whereby responses were shorter on target present trials
than target absent trials. There was a main effect of Set Size,
F(1,11) = 190.71, MSE = 303531.15, p < .001, with
responses shorter on set size 7 trials than set size 14 trials.
In addition, there was a Target Presence by Set Size
interaction, F(1, 11) = 103.96, MSE = 147848.77, p < .001,
indicating that the effect of target presence was greater on
set size 14 trials than set size 7 trials. Critically, there was a
main effect of Block, F(11, 121) = 5.18, MSE = 31649.60, p
< .001, reflecting that responses became faster as block
increased. No other main effects or interactions were
significant. For errors, there was a main effect of Target
Presence, F(1, 11) = 28.02, MSE = 0.01, p < .001, whereby
fewer errors were made on target absent than target present
trials. No other main effects or interactions were significant.

Method
Participants Twelve undergraduates (8 female) received
course credit for participating.
Design A 2 (Target presence: present vs. absent) x 2 (Set
size: 7 vs. 14 items) x 12 (Block: 1-12) within design was
used.
Stimuli The stimulus displays were presented on a 24-inch
monitor set at a resolution of 1920 by 1200, with
participants seated 80 cm from the screen. The visual search
display consisted of target and distractor letters in an
imaginary 6 x 6 grid, with cell-centres separated by 170
pixels horizontally and 128 pixels vertically. The only
letters used as targets were ―E‖, ―K‖, ―P‖, and ―Z‖. Target
letters never appeared as distractors in the visual search
displays. All letters were presented in 36-point Lucida
Console font, measuring approximately 0.6 cm horizontally
and 1.2 cm vertically, subtending 0.6 degrees of visual
angle.
Procedure Each participant received 600 trials which were
divided into 12 blocks of 50 trials. Eye tracking calibration
was conducted before each block. Additionally, drift
correction was conducted every 10 trials. Each target letter
appeared in 25% of the target present displays. The displays
were randomized for each participant. The visual search
task consisted of the search for one of the target letters
amongst either 6 or 13 distractor letters. Trials began with a
500 ms display indicating the target to be searched for on
that trial, followed by a blank screen for 200 ms and then
the search display. The participants were instructed to
search for the target letter and press the right button on a
gamepad if the target was present and the left button if the
target was absent. The display remained on the screen until
a response was made, at which point a blank screen was
presented for 200 ms. The experiment took approximately
40 minutes.

Results & Discussion
Participants were encouraged to familiarize themselves with
the task for the first 12 trials of the study, so those trials
were removed from analysis. If the pupil was undetectable
at any point during a trial (this includes blinks) then the trial
was removed (8.4% of the trials). An error analysis was
conducted on the remaining trials on which errors occurred

Figure 1: Change in RT as a function of Block relative to
the first Block in Experiment 1.
Eye Movements Change in fixation duration is plotted as a
function of block (time-on-task) in Figure 2. Measurement
of fixation duration revealed a main effect of Target
Presence, F(1, 11) = 40.60, MSE = 1403.60, p < .001,
indicating that fixation durations were shorter on target
absent than target present trials. There was a main effect of
Set Size, F(1,11) = 8.40, MSE = 350.20, p < .02, with
fixation durations being shorter on set size 14 trials than on
set size 7 trials. Note that the average RT on trials without

2821

targets and with 14 items was approximately 2-3 seconds,
and our understanding of fatigue does not operate on this
time scale. In other words, fatigue gradually increases
throughout a task and, as such, is not measured over the
course of a single trial. Critically, there was a main effect of
Block, F(11, 110) = 3.10, MSE = 261.40, p < .002,
indicating that participants’ average fixation duration
increased as block increased.

As time-on-task increases the effect of fatigue on
performance also increases. Providing subjects with a break
reduces the amount of fatigue experienced throughout the
task (Neri, et al., 2002; Stern, et al., 1993). If changes in
fixation duration are related to fatigue, then we would not
expect fixation duration to increase as a function of block in
the Break group. However, in the No Break group, we
would expect fixation duration to increase as a function of
block as it did in Experiment 1.

Method
Participants Thirty-two undergraduate students (14 female)
received course credit for participating.
Design A 2 (Break condition: breaks vs. no breaks) x 2
(Target presence: present vs. absent) x 2 (Set size: 7 items
vs. 14 items) x 12 (Block: 1-12) mixed design was used.
The break condition was manipulated between participants;
target presence, set size and block were manipulated within
participants.

Figure 2: Change in Fixation Duration as a function of
Block relative to the first Block in Experiment 1.
Relation Between Performance and Eye Movements
Finally, we calculated the change in both fixation duration
and RT as a function of block for each participant. We then
correlated these measures to examine the relationship
between changes in RT and fixation duration over time.
There was no correlation between the change in RT and the
change in fixation duration as a function time on task, r(12)
= 0.37, p = 0.234, demonstrating that the positive effect of
practice on visual search is not driving the change in
fixation duration1. Our working hypothesis is that this
increase in fixation duration reflects an increase in fatigue –
a factor that increases with time-on-task, but is qualitatively
distinct from those factors that benefit from time-on-task
and lead to a performance improvement. Experiment 2 put
this interpretation to a direct test.

Experiment 2
As in Experiment 1, participants performed a standard
attentionally demanding visual search task while their eye
movements were monitored. Critically, half of the subjects
received a three-minute break between each block of trials
and the other half of the subjects did not. Fatigue is
associated with time on task (Wilkinson, 1961; 1963; 1965).

We speculated that there may not be sufficient power to a detect a
significant relationship in the present analysis. In Experiment 2, we
report a follow-up analysis that pools the data from Experiment 1
and 2. This result is convergent with the present conclusion.

Stimuli and Procedure The stimuli and procedure were the
same as those used in Experiment 1, except that each
participant now received 576 trials which were divided into
12 blocks of 48 trials. The drift correction was now
conducted every 12 trials. In addition, half of the
participants now received breaks and half did not.
Participants in the break condition received eleven 3 minute
breaks, one at the end of each block of trials. Participants in
the no break condition did not receive breaks throughout the
task. The experiment was approximately 40 minutes in the
no break condition and 75 minutes in the break condition.

Results & Discussion
Analysis was preceded by the same trial removal procedure
used in Experiment 1 resulting in the removal of the first 12
trials and trials on which the pupil was undetectable (9.5%)
or errors occurred (3.1%). Each measure was analyzed using
a mixed ANOVA with Breaks (No Breaks vs. Breaks) as a
between participant factor and Target Presence (present vs.
absent), Set Size (7 vs. 14 items), and Block (1 to 12) as
within participant factors.
Performance Change in RTs for the break and no break
conditions are plotted as a function of block in Figure 3. For
RT, there was a main effect of Target Presence, F(1, 30) =
219.84, MSE = 836634.27, p < .001, and Set Size, F(1, 30)
= 447.56, MSE = 367483.96, p < .001. In addition, there
was a Target Presence by Set Size interaction, F(1, 30) =
255.93, MSE = 128222.02, p < .001, which indicates that
search was more efficient when the target was present than
when it was absent. Critically, there was a main effect of
Block F(11, 330) = 12.94, MSE = 78443.64, p < .001,
whereby search became more efficient, that is, the time to
determine whether a target was present or absent, became
faster as block increased. This finding replicated the practice
effect on performance observed in Experiment 1. There was

2822

also a Block by Set Size interaction F(11, 330) = 4.88, MSE
= 18439.20, p < .001, which indicates that search became
more efficient over time. No other main effects or
interactions were significant. For errors, there was a main
effect of Target Presence, F(1, 30) = 43.16, MSE = 166.03,
p < .001, and Set Size, F(1, 30) = 16.14, MSE = 29.59, p <
.001. In addition, there was a Target Presence by Set Size
interaction, F(1, 30) = 14.15, MSE = 30.30, p < .001,
indicating that the effect of target presence was greater on
set size 14 trials than set size 7 trials. No other main effects
or interactions were significant.

group in Experiment 2, reflect increasing fatigue as a
function of increased time-on-task2.

Figure 3: Change in RT as a function of Block relative to

Eye Movements Change in fixation duration is plotted as a
function of block (time-on-task) in Figure 4. Measurement
of fixation duration revealed a main effect of Target
Presence, F(1, 30) = 132.73, MSE = 1739.87, p < .001, and
a main effect of Break, F(1, 31) = 2.88, MSE = 14847.77, p
< 0.01, such that fixation durations were shorter in the no
break condition than in the break condition. There was a
Target Presence by Set Size interaction, F(1, 30) = 28.84,
MSE = 197.40, p < .001, and a Block by Target Presence
interaction, F(11, 330) = 4.09, MSE = 161.66, p < .001,
Most critically, there was a main effect of Block, F(11, 330)
= 2.41, MSE = 289.61, p < 0.007, whereby participants’
average fixation duration increased as block increased and a
Block by Break interaction, F(11, 330) = 1.87, MSE =
289.61, p < 0.042. No other main effects or interactions
were significant.
To further assess the interaction of Block with Break, we
calculated the slope relating Fixation Duration to Block.
The effect of block was larger in the no break (1.14)
condition than in the break condition (0.08), t(30) = 2.57, p
< .015. The slopes were significantly different from zero in
the no break condition, t(15) = 3.43, p < .005, but not in the
break condition, t(15) = .32, p = .752. This interaction
confirms our hypothesis that the increases in fixation
duration observed in Experiment 1, and in the No Break

Relation Between Performance and Eye Movements in
Experiment 1 and 2 Our argument that the increase in
fixation duration reflects an increase in fatigue over the
course of the task was based in part on the absence of a
correlation between the changes in fixation duration and RT
as a function of time observed in Experiment 1. Experiment
2 provides strong and convergent support for this argument
by dissociating fixation duration and RT (i.e., a Block x
Break interaction in fixation duration, and the lack of this
interaction in RT). Finally, to increase the power of the
original analysis in Experiment 1 we pooled the data from
Experiment 1 and the no break condition of Experiment 2.
There was a significant correlation, r(28) = 0.386, p < 0.04,
demonstrating that improvements in RT over time are
related to decreases in fixation duration over time in
individual subjects. As such, the positive effect of practice
on visual search (i.e., shorter RTs) is not driving the
increase in fixation duration, as individuals who improved
the least or became slower over time also showed the
greatest increase in fixation duration over the course of the
task. This finding supports the notion that an increase in
fixation duration is related to an increase in fatigue that
results from an increase in time on task.

We did conduct a parallel set of analyzes to those reported using
fixation number, saccadic amplitude, blinks, and saccadic duration.
There was no effect of block or the critical block by break
interaction on saccadic amplitude or saccadic duration. However,
we did find an effect of block on fixation number such that fixation
number decreased over the course of the task in both Experiment 1
and in both break conditions in Experiment 2. In Experiment 2, we
did not find an interaction between Break and Block. Taken
together, these data suggest that decreases in fixation frequency
over time are not indexing the negative effect of fatigue, but rather
may be indexing the positive effect of practice

General Discussion
Many everyday tasks require looking for objects over
extended periods of time. For example, security officers
may be required to conduct searches for the larger part of
the workday. Given that performing even the most basic
task for an extended period of time can lead to fatigue, and
ultimately performance failures (Dawson & Reid, 1997;
Drumer & Dinges, 2005; Williamson & Feyer, 2000), the
present study provides a measurement tool for assessing this
change in state even when it is co-occurring with the
positive effects of practice.
There are a number of reasons that fatigue might
influence fixation duration. The increase in fixation duration
may reflect an oculomotor disengage deficit. Bocca and
Denise (2006) demonstrated that the effect of fatigue on
saccadic latency was more pronounced when the fixation
remained on the screen than when the fixation was removed
prior to appearance of an eye movement target (see also
Versace et al., 2006). This pattern of results has typically
been interpreted as reflecting a difficulty in disengaging the
oculomotor system from fixation (e.g., Kingstone & Klein,
1993). Further, there is evidence that damage to the parietal
lobe leads to problems disengaging attention (Olk,
Hildebrandt & Kingstone, 2009) and fatigue is known to
disrupt parietal lobe function. Thus, fatigue may influence
the ability to initiate an eye movement.
Another possibility is that fatigue influences the decision
to move the eyes from one location to another. In the
present context, the decision to move from one location to
another is dependent on the decision that the target is not at
the currently attended location. The ability to make this
decision may be disrupted by fatigue induced as time-ontask increases. For example, a number of studies have
demonstrated a selective impairment of frontal lobe function
when an individual is fatigued (e.g., Harrison and Horne,
2000; Jones & Harrison, 2001). The frontal lobe has also
been associated with goal maintenance (e.g., Miller &
Cohen, 2001). Thus, activation of the goal ―find the letter
X‖ may decrease when individuals become fatigued as timeon-task increases. This decreased goal activation may lead
to lapses resulting in longer fixation durations. Lapses have
long been associated with fatigue and are thought to arise
because of transient disruptions in cognitive control (e.g.,
Lim & Dinges, 2008).
One important goal of future research will be to tease
apart which of these mechanisms, or combination of
mechanisms, drive the oculomotor mechanisms (e.g.,
fixation duration) that are sensitive to the effects of fatigue
in search, even when it overlaps with the positive effects of
practice on a task. This is a finding of potentially great
importance because it means that one could use fixation
duration as a means to detect the presence of fatigue well
before its inevitable negative effects begin to override the
positive benefits of time on task. For instance, security
guards at airports might be performing their examinations of
luggage x-rays quickly and effectively, but measures of
fixation duration could determine that the searcher is

growing fatigued and a break would be well advised.
Similarly, it is clear that driving requires one to constantly
be searching the visual world and yet the dangers of fatigue
are no less profound. In principle measures of fixation
duration could be obtained noninvasively while one is
driving, and when reliable increases in fixation duration are
detected, a driver could be encouraged to take a small
restbreak at the next opportunity, with the potential that
lives on the roadways could be saved. In sum, while the
ability to sustain attention in both fatigued and non-fatigued
individuals has attracted a great deal of research recently
(e.g., Lim and Dinges, 2008), the relations between indices
of sustained attention and spatial attention (i.e., eye
movements) have received little consideration. This is
surprising given the importance of vision to the performance
of everyday tasks. The present work represents an initial and
significant step forward in understanding how oculomotor
measures of sustained attention vis-a-vis fixation duration
can be used to detect the presence of observer fatigue
independent of the beneficial effects that time-on-task can
have on visual search performance.
