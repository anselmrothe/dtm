software takes this specification and creates a biologically
realistic neural model, including various cortical areas, the
basal ganglia, and the thalamus.
   An example model using the SPA is shown in Figure 1. It
is able to follow basic commands such as “WRITE TWO”
and “REMEMBER THREE <long pause> WRITE
NUMBER”. When run in Nengo, this creates a model with
48,000 spiking neurons and produces predictions of spike
patterns, firing rates, fMRI time-courses, accuracy, and
reaction times. Complete details can be found in the book
How to Build a Brain (Eliasmith, 2013).
