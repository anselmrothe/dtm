Toddlers were assigned to either the Spontaneous condition
or the Explained condition (n = 16/condition). There were
no age differences between the conditions (p = ns).
Materials The light box was constructed from a black box
(6 in x 6 in x 6 in) with a small blue lamp (2 in diameter)
emerging from the front panel which was controlled
surreptitiously by the experimenter. An orange button box
was connected to the black box by a long orange rod (15 in).
A black screen served as an occluder throughout the
procedure. An additional black screen was placed behind
the black box to obscure the experimenter’s surreptitious
activation of the blue lamp.
Procedure Figure 1 presents a schematic depiction of the
procedure from Experiments 1-3. Upon entering the testing
space, all children saw the button box connected to the light
box. The experimenter directed the child’s attention to all
components of the novel toy (the button box, the connected
rod, and the light box) without labeling the specific items
(e.g., “Look at this”) (see Figure 1, top panel). The button
was then occluded from the child’s view with the black
screen. In the Spontaneous condition, toddlers saw the light
box light up and flash blue (4 flashes, approximately 1 s
total) apparently spontaneously. In the Explained condition,
the experimenter touched the rim of the light and then light
box lit up and flashed blue.
   In both conditions the experimenter then moved the
occluder to reveal the button box and occlude the light box.
The experimenter then pushed the button for 1 s.
   During the test trial, the experimenter removed the
occluder from in front of the light box so that all
components were visible to the child. The experimenter                        Figure 1: Procedure for Experiments 1-3.
