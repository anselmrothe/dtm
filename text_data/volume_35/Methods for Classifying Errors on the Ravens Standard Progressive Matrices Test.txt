  Performance is generally measured in terms of overall
score, i.e. number correct, which can then be used as an
index into normative test data to determine an IQ score or
percentile ranking for that individual. While total score is
certainly an important variable, serving as a coarse measure
of an individual’s overall ability, there are alternative
dimensions of performance that may provide a finer-grained
view of an individual’s cognitive processing:
  1) Per-item accuracy, e.g. differential item functioning,
       takes into account potential variation even when
       individuals may obtain the same total score (Facon &
       Nuchadee, 2010; Lynn, Alik, & Irwing, 2004; Van
       Herwegen, Farran, and Annaz, 2011).
  2) Reaction time can be used to understand the stages of
        processing in solving a single item (Bethell-Fox,
        Lohman, & Snow, 1984) or to compare performance                          Figure 1: Example of an RPM-like problem.

answers had been marked, and raters assigned every
distracter to one of categories #1-10 in Table 1. Kind II
classification used another test booklet copy in which the
correct answers had been marked and the matrix portions of
each problem had been cut off, so only the answer choices
were visible; raters assigned each distracter to one of
categories #11-17 in Table 1, or left it uncategorized.
   Initial agreement between the two raters was 82% for
Kind I errors and (coincidentally) 82% for Kind II errors.
