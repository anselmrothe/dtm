junctions, the precuneus, and the anterior paracingulate
cortex (Ciaramidaro et al., 2007). This model is based
on a novel theoretical distinction among varieties of
intention, which differ by the nature of an individual’s
pursued goal (private or social) and by the social
interaction’s temporal dimension (present or future).
The intentionality network, which is independent from
modality of expression, either linguistic or gestural
(Enrici, Adenzato, Cappa, Bara & Tettamanti, 2011),
shows different activation patterns in relation to the
nature of the intentions. The theoretical model of
intention proposed contributes to enlarge our
knowledge on the neurobiological bases of intention
processing, in both healthy people and in people with
impairments to the neurocognitive system that
underlies intention recognition (Bara, Ciaramidaro,
Walter & Adenzato, 2011).
