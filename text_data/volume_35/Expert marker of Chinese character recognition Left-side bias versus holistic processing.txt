Holistic processing and left-side bias are both behavioral markers of
expert face recognition. In contrast, expertise in Chinese character
recognition involves left-side bias but reduced holistic processing
(Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009). Here we examine whether the reduction in
holistic processing associated with expert Chinese character
