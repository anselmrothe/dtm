claimed to be the key to the mystery of human evolution and
cognition.
       At first sight, such a groundbreaking point would be
expected to lead to an intensive debate and to meet strong
criticism from the less radical researchers. However, in fact,
there are no heated debate around conceptual blending the-
ory. We can find a number of papers raising some objec-
tions (Gibbs 2000; Harder 2003; Brandt 2005; Oakley,
Hougaard 2008, 12; Ferguson, Sanford 2008, 610), but a
comprehensive analysis of the theory’s underpinnings,
methodology, and heuristic potential is a matter of the fu-
ture. This paper can be considered as a step in that direction.
    Theoretical underpinnings and structure of
                conceptual blending theory

readers, I will start with a coarse-grained description of the                 Fig. 1. The basic schema of the Buddhist Monk
