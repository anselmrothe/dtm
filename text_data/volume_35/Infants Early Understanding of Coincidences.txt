   In the Free Play phase, the infant was shown a white box
containing three different colored balls. She was encouraged
to play with the balls for approximately 30 seconds, and the
experimenter ensured that the infant touched every ball.
This phase was to allow the infants to become familiar with
the balls used in the experiment.
   The Familiarization phase that followed consisted of two
trials. To begin each trial, the experimenter placed the large
box on the stage with its front curtain down. Then, she lifted
the curtain to reveal a population of 6 different colored
balls, saying “See this?” She proceeded to shake the box
side to side 4 times, and then set the box back to the center
of the stage. While the infant was looking at the stage, the
