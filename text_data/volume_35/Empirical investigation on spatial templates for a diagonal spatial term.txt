Abstract
The meaning of spatial relations have been intensively studied in cognitive science research. A spatial template is one
of the typical representations of spatial relations, which maps
a position of a located object to its acceptability for the corresponding spatial term. Spatial templates have been investigated for several orthogonal spatial relations. However, diagonal spatial relations have attracted less attention. The present
study aims at empirically determining the spatial template for
a Japanese diagonal spatial term, “migiue (upper right)”. The
data was collected with various geometrical conditions changing the size of objects and the aspect ratio of the background.
The analysis of the data revealed that the reference axis for
“migiue (upper right)” was the direction of 45◦ , and the acceptability of the diagonal relation could be affected by the
acceptable regions of the adjacent orthogonal relations.
Keywords: spatial language; diagonal spatial term; spatial
template;

Introduction
There have been numerous studies on language and spatial relations in cognitive science (Talmy, 1983; Herskovits, 1985;
Tversky & Lee, 1998; Levinson, 2003; Coventry & Garrod,
2004). Understanding a spatial relation involves reference
objects (RO), located objects (LO), selection of an appropriate reference frame with respect to the context (CarlsonRadvansky, 1997; Carlson-Radvansky & Jiang, 1998), and
the meaning of the spatial relation. As a representation of the
meaning of spatial relations, Logan and Sadler (1996) proposed a spatial template that maps an LO position to the acceptability for the corresponding spatial term. They determined the spatial templates for six projective spatial terms (
“above”, “below”, “left of”, “right of”, “over” and “under”)
and four topological spatial terms (“next to”, “away from”,
“near to”, and “far from”) through experiments. The LO positions were discretised by a 7 × 7 grid and each cell was assigned to an acceptability scale from 1 (bad) to 9 (good).
Surprisingly, diagonal spatial relations have attracted less
attention than orthogonal spatial relations. One reason might
be the fact that spatial terms expressing diagonal spatial relations tend to be lengthy in English, e.g. “the LO is in front
of and to the right of the RO”. In contrast, as Gapp (1995)
noted, such combinations of spatial terms were very common
in German and could be expressed in a simple form. This is
also the case in Japanese, the target language of the present
study. For instance, “migi (right)” and “ue (above)” can be
directly combined to make a term “migiue (upper right)” for
representing the upper right direction.

Another reason could be related to the so-called oblique effect, which claims humans show greater sensitivity to ratings
with the orthogonal orientations, i.e. vertical and horizontal,
than to other diagonal orientations (Appelle, 1972; Furmanski & Engel, 2000; Meng & Qian, 2005). The orthogonal
spatial relations are more important for humans, thus these
relations might have been intensively studied.
For investigating the acceptability of spatial relations, several researchers have used a radial grid layout (Huttenlocher,
Hedges, & Duncan, 1991; Gapp, 1995; Hayward & Tarr,
1995; Crawford, Regier, & Huttenlocher, 2000; Huttenlocher,
Hedges, Corrigan, & Crawford, 2004) instead of a square
grid layout as Logan and Sadler (1996) did. They were interested in how angular deviation affected the acceptability
of spatial terms. The spatial terms they were mainly concerned with were, however, still limited to orthogonal spatial
terms1 . They did not explicitly concern themselves with the
acceptability of diagonal spatial terms such as “migiue (upper
right)”.
Against this background, the present study discusses the
acceptability of a Japanese diagonal spatial term. More
concretely, we aim at determining a spatial template for a
Japanese term “migiue (upper right)”2 with taking into account three geometrical factors: the size of RO and LO, and
the aspect ratio of the background. The background aspect
ratio has rarely been taken into account in past studies.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants Thirty four undergraduates and graduates (30
males and 4 females) from Tokyo Institute of Technology participated in the experiment. Each participant received 1,000
JPY for his/her participation. All participants were native
Japanese speakers.
Material and design We have four quadrants to consider
for diagonal spatial terms: “upper right”, “upper left”, “lower
right” and “lower left”. Assuming symmetric acceptability
1 Gapp (1995) investigated diagonal spatial terms as a combination of two orthogonal spatial terms. He did not, however, take into
account the dominance of orthogonal relations over diagonal relations.
2 Although we denote this target term as “upper right” in the rest
of the paper, the actual term used in the experiments was the original
Japanese term “migiue”.

We had two variations for the object size: large (50 × 50 pixels) and small (25 × 25 pixels), and three variations for the
background aspect ratio: 5:5, 5:7 and 5:9. Depending on the
background aspect ratio, the cells from the first column to
the fifth column (5:5), the cells from the first column to the
seventh column (5:7) and the cells from the first column to
the ninth column (5:9) were used for the LO position respectively. The total size of the background was 500 × 500 pixels
for the 5:5 case, 500 × 700 for the 5:7 case, and 500 × 900
pixels for the 5:9 cases. The number of LO positions varied
depending on the background aspect ratio: 24 for the 5:5 case,
34 for the 5:7 case and 44 for the 5:9 case3 . The total number of trials for the acceptability rating became 408 ((#RO
size) × (#LO size) × (#LO position for the three aspect ratios) = 2 × 2 × (24 + 34 + 44)). In addition to these trials, 136
fillers were added in which the LO was placed in other quadrants with the sentences being changed accordingly. The total
number of the trials for a participant was 544 (408 + 136).

The circle is at the upper right of the square.

Figure 1: Example of stimulus
among these four quadrants, we investigated spatial templates
for the upper right quadrant only. To obtain spatial templates
for “upper right”, we basically followed the goodness rating
experiment described in (Logan & Sadler, 1996). Figure 1
shows the interface of a trial that was presented to the participants. Against the coloured background, a square (the reference object: RO) is placed in the center, and the circle (the located object: LO) is placed someplace within the upper right
quadrant of the background. A sentence describing the spatial relation between the RO and LO is presented below the
figure; “En ha seihôkei no migiue ni aru. (the circle is to the
upper right of the square.)” in this example. The participants
were instructed to rate the relevance of the sentence describing the spatial relation between two objects on the scale of 1
(bad) to 7 (good) by clicking one of seven buttons.

Procedure The 544 trials were presented to each participant one by one on a 24 inch computer display of an iMac.
The sequence of the trials were pseudo randomly generated
with the occasional insertion of fillers for each participant.
At one third and two thirds of the trial sequence, the participants were allowed to take a short break as long as he/she
wanted. The participants finished their task within 20 to 40
minutes.

(Experiment 1)

Figure 3: Spatial template for “migiue (upper right)”
(Experiment 1, R=large, L=large)

The grid for the upper right quadrant with the origin at
the RO position was configured as shown in Figure 2. The
size of a cell was 50 × 50 pixels. The LO was placed one
of these cells with its centroid at the center of the cell. The
RO was placed with its centroid at the left bottom corner of
the cell A1. The grid lines were invisible to the participants.
We considered three geometrical factors: the RO size (R),
the LO size (L) and the aspect ratio of the background (A).

Results Figure 3 shows spatial templates for “upper right”
with a large RO and LO. Each cell denotes the average rating
across all participants. The mean standard error of the averages in Figure 3 is 0.217. This value is comparable to the
result from (Logan & Sadler, 1996), which is 0.271. From

that the RO is fixed at the A1 position.

these templates, we can see that the direction of a 45◦ angle
is the most relevant as a reference axis for “upper right” (red
coloured cells) regardless of the background aspect ratio. In
addition to these three templates, we had nine more templates
for a combination of three geometrical factors: the RO size,
the LO size and the background aspect ratio. We omit the
other templates due to space constraints. The tendency of the
other templates is similar to Figure 3.

Analysis We conducted a four-way ANOVA with average
ratings as the dependent variable, and the background aspect
ratio (A: 5:5, 5:7 and 5:9), the RO size (R: large and small),
the LO size (L: large and small), and the LO position (P: 24
positions) as the independent variables. Since the cells in the
four right-most columns in Figure 2 were not included in the
5:5 aspect ratio configuration, we adopted only 24 cells in the
column 1 to 5 for the analysis. Table 1 shows the result of
the multivariate ANOVA indicating significant main effects
of the LO position (P) and the RO size (R).

LO size

Figure 4: Interaction between object sizes
To investigate the effect of the aspect ratio (A) and the RO
size (R) at each LO position (P), we conducted multiple comparisons for the interactions, P-A and P-R. The result of the
multiple comparisons (Bonferroni’s method) is shown in Table 2. Table 2 reveals that the effect by the RO size (R) is

Discussion Although there is no significant main effect of
the background aspect ratio (A) in Table 1, several positions
show a significant main effect of the aspect ratio in Table 2,
i.e. B3, B4, D3, E3, E4 and E5. Among these positions, the
ratings for the positions above the reference axis of “upper
right”, i.e. the 45◦ line, (D3, E3, and E4) were the highest
with the aspect ratio 5:5. In contrast, the ratings for the positions below the reference axis (B3 and B4) were the highest

3565

with the aspect ratio 5:9. This tendency was observed at other
cells. Figure 5 shows an overlaid spatial template for “upper
right” with different background aspect ratios (5:5, 5:7 and
5:9, i.e. three templates in Figure 3). The upper, middle and
lower figures in a cell denote the acceptability ratings for the
background aspect ratio 5:5, 5.7 and 5.9 respectively. The red
coloured cells denote the reference axis for “upper right” and
the dotted line denotes the diagonal line of the background
with aspect ratios 5:7 and 5:9. This figure suggests that although the reference axis for “upper right” remains at the
45◦ direction regardless of the background aspect ratio, the
acceptability for the positions below the reference axis is affected by the boundary of the background, i.e. the diagonal
line of the background.

Figure 6: Effect by the RO size (Experiment 1)
Considering the earlier research results (Gapp, 1995;
Regier & Carlson, 2001; Kobayashi, Terai & Tokunaga,
2008), given a fixed size of the background, a larger RO is
expected to give a higher average rating, since the good region would enlarge according to the RO size. Figure 4, however, indicates the opposite result; the smaller RO gives the
higher average rating. This would be explained by the effect
of other spatial relations, “above” and “right” in this case. A
larger RO enlarges the good region for “above” and “right”
as well as that for “upper right”. Considering the oblique
effect, the orthogonal (“above” and “right”) relations would
be dominant over the diagonal (“upper right”) relation, thus
the enlargement of the good region for the diagonal relation
would be suppressed by those of the adjacent orthogonal relations. The main effect of the RO size at positions A2 and
C1 in Table 2 also supports this hypothesis. Figure 6 illustrates this explanation. When the RO is large (the left figure),
the centroid of the LO is at the edge of the good region for
“right” (the gray area), while when the RO is small (the right
figure), the LO centroid is out of the good region. Thus, the
acceptability of “rightness” in the right figure could be lower
than that in the left figure, and the good region for “right” interferes less with that of “upper right”. This hypothesis would
explain the reason why the small RO gave a higher rating.
The interaction between the RO and LO sizes can be also
explained in terms of the interference by the good region of
the adjacent orthogonal spatial relations. As Figure 4 shows,
when the RO is small, the average rating for the small LO is
significantly higher than that for the large LO (p < .05), and

Figure 7: Interaction between the RO and LO sizes

when the LO is small, the average rating for the small RO is
significantly higher than that for the large RO (p < .01). Figure 7 illustrates the explanation for this observation. Two LOs
are depicted as white circles in the same cell for comparison.
The centroid of the LOs moves relative to the good region for
“right” according to the combination of object sizes. When
the RO is small (the right figure), the centroid of the LOs is
out of the good region for “right”, and the overlapping area
between the LO and the good region drastically decreases as
the LO becomes small (the inner circle). Actually, there is
no overlap in this case. When the RO is large (the left figure), the centroid of the LOs is at the edge of the good region,
and the difference of overlapping areas is less than that of the
small RO case. The ratios of the overlap against the LO are
the same; both overlapping areas are half of the object sizes.
Thus, the good region for “right” has less effect on the good
region for “upper right”. That leads to the higher average rating for the small RO and LO. Table 2 shows a significant difference by the RO size (R) at the lowest horizontal cell (A2),
which falls into the good region for “to the right of the RO”.
The difference is also significant at the leftmost vertical cell
(C1), which falls into the good region for “above the RO”.
These significant interactions support the above explanation.
In summary, we have drawn a hypothesis that since orthogonal relations are dominant over diagonal relations, the good
region of the former would interfere with that of the latter.
We conducted a follow up experiment in order to verify this
hypothesis, which is described in the next section.

because the relative position of the LO centroid does not vary
even though the RO size changes as shown in Figure 9.

Method
Participants Thirty three graduates and undergraduates (28
males and 8 females) from Tokyo Institute of Technology participated in the follow up experiment. There was no overlap
in participants between the two experiments. Each participant
received 1,000 JPY for his/her participation. All participants
were native Japanese speakers.

Material and design The experimental setup is the same
as Experiment 1 except for the grid configuration. In Experiment 2, the position of the RO was shifted by 50 pixels both
downward and leftward as shown in Figure 8. The column 1
and row A were also shifted accordingly. This configuration
is more similar to that of Logan and Sadler (1996) than the
configuration of Experiment 1. The procedure of the experiment is the same as that of Experiment 1.

Analysis and discussion We conducted a four-way
ANOVA in the same manner as Experiment 1. Table 3 shows
the result of the multivariate ANOVA. As we expected, the
main effect of the RO size (R) and the interaction between
the RO and LO size disappeared. This supports our hypothesis described in the previous section.

Result Figure 10 shows the spatial templates for “upper
right” with three different aspect ratios. The other conditions
are the same as Figure 3. In this configuration, the participants tend to give very low ratings in the horizontal and vertical aligned cells, i.e. column 1 and row A. This is obviously
because these cells are completely located within the good
region for “above” and “right”.

The present study discussed the acceptability of the LO positions for a Japanese diagonal spatial term “migiue (upper
right)” based on the empirical data. The data was collected
through the experiments taking into account three geometrical factors: the size of RO and LO, and the background
aspect ratio. Our findings through the data analysis can be
summarised as follows.

Figure 10: Spatial template for “migiue (upper right)”
(Experiment 2, R=large, L=large)
If our hypothesis is correct, the effect of the RO size and
the interaction between the RO and LO sizes would disappear

• The reference axis of “migiue (upper right)” stays at the
direction of 45◦ even though the aspect ratio of the background varies. This seems robust as far as the aspect ratios used in the experiments (5:5, 5:7 and 5:9). However,
according to the horizontal extension of the background,
the acceptability of the area below the reference axis tends
to be higher, and that of the area above the reference axis
tends to be lower. This would be the effect by the diagonal line of the background. This tendency is particularly
remarkable in the distant area.

Interestingly, this observation is contrary to the finding by
Gapp (1995), which claimed that the acceptability was not
affected by the distance, although it became slightly higher
when the LO was close to the RO within the area where
the angular deviation from the reference axis is less than
45◦ . In our data, the angular deviation is less than 45◦ in
all positions, but the distant positions tend to show higher
acceptability. For instance, the pairs of cells A2 and B5,
and B1 and E2 have the same angular deviation from the
reference axis, about ±26.5◦ . As Figure 3 shows, the ratings of the distant positions (B5 and E2) are consistently
higher than that of the close positions (A2 and B1) in
all aspect ratios. An ANOVA on the average ratings at
these four positions showed a main effect of the distance
(F(1, 33) = 20.2, p < .01).
• The acceptability of the diagonal spatial relation is affected
by the adjacent orthogonal spatial relations. In our case, the
acceptable regions of “above” and “right” interfere with the
acceptability of “upper right”. This hypothesis was confirmed by the main effect of the RO size, and the interaction
between the RO and LO size.
The above-mentioned contradiction between the results of
ours and Gapp (1995)’s would be also explained by the
interference by the orthogonal relations. The closer the LO
is to the RO, the closer the LO is to the reference axis of
the adjacent orthogonal relations (“above” and “right”) as
well, thus the acceptability would be affected more by the
orthogonal relations.
Considering these findings together, we would say that the
acceptability of diagonal spatial terms is determined by the
interaction among four axes, namely, the horizontal axis, the
virtical axis, the diagonal axis at 45◦ and the diaglonal axis of
the background. Among these axes, the two orthogonal axes
are most dominant as past studies suggested. The diagonal
axis of the background seems most recessive but still affects
the diagonal axis at 45◦ .
Future research directions include the evaluation of existing computational models for spatial relations against the diagonal spatial relations. According to our preliminary experiments in which the Proximal and Centre-of-mass model and
Attention Vector Sum model (Regier & Carlson, 2001) were
applied to our data for “upper right” with setting its reference
axis at 45◦ , these models fit quite well to the data. We found,
however, the deviation from the data enlarged as the deviation of the diagonal axis of the background from the reference
axis at 45◦ increased. As described above, these two diagonal axes should be taken into account in these computational
models for diagonal spatial terms. We need further investigation to determine the quantitative effect of the interaction
of these axes on the acceptability of the diagonal relations for
building a computational model.
