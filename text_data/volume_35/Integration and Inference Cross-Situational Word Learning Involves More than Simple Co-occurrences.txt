thought of as learning from negative evidence, as it entails
noting the absence of particular objects and labels.

ability to use the available information in the three processes
of co-occurrence tracking, forward integration and
backward inference. The tasks were designed to look
specifically at how trial-by-trial information is retained and
processed. We also relate performance on the miniature
