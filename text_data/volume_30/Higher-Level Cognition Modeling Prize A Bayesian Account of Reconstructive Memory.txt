Methods
Participants were undergraduate students at the University
of California, Irvine. There were 18 participants in the
norming phase and 25 participants in the test phase.
   For the norming phase there were 37 images in 2
categories: fruits and vegetables. For the test phase, 24 of
the objects from each of the norming categories were used.
See Figure 4 for examples. Another class of stimuli was also
developed: abstract shapes created by drawing outlines of
objects and filling with blue. See Figure 3 for examples.
