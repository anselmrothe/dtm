"conformity," it has been shown that the tendency to imitate
others rather than innovate (“conformity bias”) can be
adaptive in uncertain environments (Boyd & Richerson,
1985; Kameda & Nakanishi, 2002). Cultural conventions
are thought to be a form of large-scale imitation of
behaviors that evolve along with their associated
populations, subject to accompanying adaptive pressures
(Boyd & Richerson, 2005).
Humans' rare talent among animals for direct and flexible
imitation has been called "no-trial learning" (Bandura,
1965). This talent allows an imitator to add new behaviors
to his or her repertoire without the costs of trial-and-error
learning. However, the population-level benefits of
imitation are not necessarily straightforward. A simulation
by Rogers (1988) of agents in a nonstationary environment
showed that if the avoidance of learning costs is the only
benefit of imitation, then the addition of imitators to a
population of individual learners does not improve the
average fitness of the population.
Boyd & Richerson (1995) confirmed and extended this
result, but showed conversely that imitation provides a net
population fitness benefit if it makes individual learning
more accurate or less costly (e.g. by allowing selective
learning or cumulative improvements). Kameda &
Nakanishi (2003) found that if agents can selectively switch
between individual learning and imitation, a "cultural"
population has a mean fitness advantage over an
‘‘acultural’’ population. Even though it operates at the
individual level, imitation can generate substantial
population-level effects when iterated over time and space.
Laland (2004) reviews studies of several strategies for the
selection of imitation ("copying") over innovation ("asocial
learning") in terms of when to copy, and who to copy. The
when category includes the copy when asocial learning is
costly strategy, which selects imitation when innovation
entails excessive known costs in energy, time or risk, and
copy when uncertain, which selects imitation when the
environment or the payoff for innovation is uncertain. The
who category includes the copy successful individuals
strategy, which selects imitation of the action taken by
successful observed models; and copy if better, which is
similar to the latter but entails a comparison with one's

Abstract
In this experiment, we implemented a problem-solving task in
which groups of participants simultaneously play a simple
puzzle game, with score feedback provided after each of 24
rounds. Each participant in a group is allowed to view and
imitate the guesses of others during the game. Results show
that when the utility of others' innovations is unambiguous,
individuals base their own solutions on personal innovation
and productively imitate other players' innovations early on,
and that this tendency to imitate is proportional to the relative
amount of information available from others. Average trends
of innovation and imitation decreased across rounds as player
guesses stabilized and scores increased. Mean scores and
imitation increased with group size, while individual
innovation decreased. Results are consistent with previously
studied social learning strategies in several taxa.
Keywords: Social learning; innovation; imitation; problem
solving; innovation diffusion.

Background
In uncertain situations, one can often obtain useful
information from others that would be inaccurate or
inefficient to procure on one's own. A particularly important
use of this kind of socially-mediated information is "social
learning," which has been defined by Boyd & Richerson
(2005) as "the acquisition of behavior by observation or
teaching from other conspecifics." Common examples of
this include learning "rules of thumb" for accomplishing a
task from a more experienced practitioner, or soliciting
recommendations for restaurants or films from friends.
Evidence has been presented for social learning in many
nonhuman animals, including foraging choices in starlings
(Templeton & Giraldeau, 1996), foraging sites and escape
routes in guppies (Reader, Kendal & Laland, 2003), food
preferences in various rodent species (Galef & Giraldeau,
2001), mate choices in black grouse (Höglund, Alatalo,
Gibson, & Lundberg, 1995), and many others.
But resources must generally be spent in gathering or
creating new information before it can be shared. Thus an
apparent trade-off develops between individually learning or
producing locally novel information (innovation) and social
learning (imitation). Despite the negative connotations of
583

previous actions. Though many theoretical and animal
accounts of these strategies exist, the empirical evidence for
them in humans is still somewhat unclear.
The present experiment explores the dynamics of
selective learning and cumulative improvements using a
simple problem-solving task, in which guesses are
composed of sets of discrete units, and each player can view
and imitate the guesses of other players. Players receive
round-based score feedback about the quality of their
guesses, and the score function takes into account linear and
interaction terms for the guess units to create a complex
problem space. Players can see their own and each others'
most recent guesses and scores, and may copy entire
guesses or parts thereof from other players (see Figure 1).
As in a precursor to this study (Wisdom & Goldstone,
2007), the in-game interaction between players was
intentionally impoverished so as to allow examination of
imitation and innovation behavior unencumbered by more
complex social interactions, such as direct communication
among players. This paradigm can be considered a general
case for specific group interactions like explicit competition
or cooperation, in which task goals are more structured by
incentive. The principal differences between the present
study and the precursor study referenced above are (1) direct
recording rather than estimation of occurrences of
innovation, imitation, etc., (2) use of a more challenging,
interesting, and general task, and (3) the addition of an
“assistive memory” (last round / best round) display to
reduce effects of participant memory limitations.
Though the task environment within each condition does
not vary over time as in many studies of imitation, the
problem space is designed to be sufficiently large and
complex so as to provide substantial uncertainty about
optimal guesses and strategies. In addition, the difficulty of
the problem is manipulated across conditions by changing the
size of the problem space, via the size of the set of units to be
chosen from and the size of the subset that may be chosen and
evaluated at one time. A range of group sizes is tested to
investigate the effects of the availability of other players’
guess information on individual performance and strategies.
We expected to confirm the following results from a
previous, similar experiment which used a different task
(Wisdom & Goldstone, 2007): there should be an increase
in the rate of imitation with group size, and a qualitative
deficit in the performance of isolated individuals compared
to those in groups. Furthermore, it was anticipated that
participants would use the copy when uncertain strategy, so
that there would be more imitation earlier in each game
when the problem space is relatively unexplored, as well as
in the more difficult condition. It was also expected that
participants would use the copy successful individuals
strategy, so that the participants with the highest scores
would be copied most often. The two strategies above were
selected because of their confirmed prevalence in nonhuman
social learning, and their relative scarcity in the human
social learning literature, in addition to their anticipated
simplicity of detection using this task.

Method
Participants were recruited from the Indiana University
Psychology Department undergraduate subject pool, and
were given course credit for taking part in the study.
Participants populated each session by signing up at will for
scheduled experiments with a maximum capacity of 9
persons. 49 sessions (containing a total of 201 participants)
were run. 9 sessions (containing a total of 39 participants)
were discarded due to network or software problems. The
remaining 162 participants were distributed as shown in
Table 1.

We implemented the experimental game using custom
software programmed in Java and Flash, which runs in a
web browser. Each participant uses a mouse to interact with
the game. All participant computers communicate with a
game server, which updates score and team information for
participants at the end of each round, and records data. In
the game itself, participants attempt to maximize the
number of points earned by their chosen subsets ("teams")
from a set ("league") of creature icons over 24 rounds. The
display includes an area for the participant's own current
team, another that can be toggled to show the participant's
previous round team or best-scoring team so far in the game
(along with the associated score), a league area which shows
all of the icons (team members) that can be chosen from,
and indications of the current round in the game and the
amount of time remaining in the current round.
In games with more than one participant, each
participant's display also shows the teams and associated
scores of all other participants in the previous round. Icons
can be copied from any part of the display to the
participant's current team by dragging and dropping them
with the mouse, except for those already on the current
team, which are faded in the display and non-clickable.
Icons may be present on more than one participant’s team in
the same round. The current team can be replaced entirely
by another team by using the score box above the latter as a
"handle" and dragging it to the current team area. A
screenshot of the participant interface for a game with 5
participants is shown in Figure 1.
At the beginning of each session, players are given a
hands-on demo of the game (including the various ways to
move creatures to one's current team), and further informed
about the mechanics of the game, including the following
information. Each game consists of 24 rounds, and each
round is 10 seconds long. Score feedback is given after each
round: if the participant's score has improved from the

associations with the point distribution are shuffled
randomly for each game, so that their appearance and
placement in the display will not give clues as to their point
values during the course of an experiment session.
In each round, the following data are automatically
recorded for each player: the icons on the current team at the
end of the round, the source of each icon, and the resulting
score. The source information indicates whether each icon is
unchanged from the previous round (Incumbent), copied
from the player's own previous round team after initially
being removed from the team (Previous Round), copied
from the player's own best-scoring team so far (Best
Round), chosen from the league display (League), or copied
from another player's team (Copy). The latter includes the
persistent identifier of the copied player, to allow further
analyses of imitation decisions. Though any creature icon
may always be copied from the League display, it is
assumed that this action is not substituted for copying from
another intended source with any significant frequency, due
to the additional effort required.

previous round, the display counts up to the new score and
turns green, and if it has worsened, the display counts down
to the new score and turns red. At the end of each game, the
display shows the player's final score, along with a table of
the scores of each player in each round of the game, which
is sorted by average score. The player's own scores are
highlighted to provide a notion of their relative performance
without placing competitive emphasis on it. Players are
instructed to do their best to find a high-scoring team in
each round. At the beginning of each game, each player’s
team is a random selection of creature icons from the
league.
Each participant group plays 8 games, of which half have
a large league and team size (48 and 6, respectively), and
half smaller (24 and 5). These two parameter settings are
intended to vary the level of difficulty of the game, with the
former being more difficult because the score distribution
and combinatorics make high-scoring teams rarer than in the
latter case, even though higher scores are possible.
In each game, each icon is associated with a certain
positive number of points, and several special pairs of icons
are associated with separate score bonuses or penalties. The
score for a team is computed by summing the individual
point values for each icon and then adding or subtracting the
value of any special pairs present. The pairs do not overlap,
and the distribution is designed to be challenging: pairs
which give large positive bonuses are distributed among
icons with small individual point values, and pairs which
give large negative penalties are found among icons with
large individual point values (see Figure 2).
Individual point values per icon range from 1 to 8 points,
and pair interaction values range from -20 to 20 points, so
that the possible score ranges for the large and small league
and team size combinations are [-6,60] and [-6,51],
respectively. Participants are not given information about
the maximum score, the score distribution, and the identity
of the interaction pairs, though they could conceivably
be deduced during play. The icons' display position and

Results
Dependent variables were averaged across participants to
give measures for the group’s aggregate activity in a
session.

Score
Scores for each game were normalized to the range [0,1]
according to the score range possible with the associated
league and team size. The average score for all participants
in all rounds was .597. Curve fit estimation for a linear
regression of score data against game round showed a
significant positive relationship (F(1,958)=1015, p<.0001)
(see Figure 3). The average improvement in score over the
course of a game was .261, and there was a significant but
comparatively small average increase (.051) in scores across
game order within a session (F(1,318)=11.9, p<.001).
Trends in score over rounds did not significantly differ with
group size. Scores increased significantly with group size
(F(1,38)=70.5, p<.0001), with an average score difference
of .101 between isolated participants and those in the largest
group size of 9 (see Figure 4). In similar analyses against
league size, scores decreased significantly from the smaller
to the larger league size (F(1,78)=31.7, p<.0001), from .607
to .54, an average difference of .067.

Choice Source

The proportion of the Previous Round choice source was
negligible on average (approximately .01 or less). No
significant relationships were found between the use of any
choice source and League Size, or game order within
sessions. The overall imitation rate (the proportion of
rounds for all participants in which the Copy choice
proportion was greater than zero) was .293. When imitating,
participants copied a participant with the highest score
82.6% of the time, and copied participants with higher
scores than their own 92.4% of the time.

The first two rounds of choice source data were excluded
from round-based analysis due to artifacts related to the
beginning of the game (neighbor score data not provided
in the first round, etc.) Regression analyses of the
remaining data showed that across rounds, there were
significant increases in the average proportions of the
Incumbent (F(1,878)=5.8, p=.016) and Best Round
(F(1,878)=26.6, p<.0001) choices in each team, while
significant decreases were observed in the League
(F(1,878)=61.6, p<.0001) and (F(1,878)=18.5, p<.0001)
choices (see Figure 5). As group size increased, the
proportion of the choice increased (F(1,38)=75.6,
p<.0001), while accompanying decreases were observed
in proportions of the Best Round (F(1,38)=15.4, p<.001)
and League (F(1,38)=24, p<.0001) choices (see Figure
6).

League Coverage
In order to measure the heterogeneity of the solutions within
a group, we calculated the League Coverage, defined as the
proportion of icons in the league represented on one or more
participants' teams during a given round, normalized by the
participant group size.

memory for successful (or at least satisfactory) guesses for
each participant. This also shows that the improvements in
score within games were due to cumulative improvements
by participants employing the uncertainty-reduction
capability of social learning (Kameda & Nakanishi, 2002).
Since the ratio of innovation to imitation did not change
significantly across rounds, it may be that they were treated
as complements for one another rather than substitutes. This
may have been due to the relatively low cost to innovation
in terms of risk. Though it was possible to pursue fruitless
innovation and thus lower one’s score relative to neighbors,
there was always the possibility of copying the highestscoring participant and “catching up” with the rest of the
group.
The increase in imitation with larger group sizes implies
that copying is more attractive when there are more
neighbors from which to copy, perhaps simply because
there is a greater probability of encountering a neighbor
with a score greater than one's own. A different kind of
consistency with the copy when uncertain strategy is shown
here: imitation is favored when the payoff for innovation is
relatively uncertain, compared to the abundant unambiguous
information available about the content and utility of
neighbors’ guesses. The accompanying decreases in
innovation and retrieval in larger group sizes imply that
individual learning accordingly becomes less attractive than
social learning when there are more neighbors to imitate. A
related interpretation is that having more neighbors may
simply make it more likely that one of them will imitate and
improve upon one's own guesses more productively than
oneself, and thus that recourse to a previous best guess is
not as useful.
In any case, the correlation of score increase with
increasing group size implies that the above strategy
changes are advantageous under these conditions. This in
turn implies that the adaptive value of imitation in this
context is due to its facilitation of selective learning and the
generation of cumulative improvements (Boyd &
Richerson, 1995; Kameda & Nakanishi, 2003).
The use of the copy-successful-individuals strategy was
confirmed by the tendency of imitators to copy the highestscoring individuals. Furthermore, equally successful
individuals do not simply copy each other at random, since
nearly all imitation results in score increases for the
imitator, confirming the use of the copy-if-better strategy.
It is slightly curious that the difference in difficulty
between the two League Size conditions did not produce an
accompanying difference in guessing strategies. In
particular, this is in conflict with the findings of Baron,
Vandello, & Brunsman (1996), which indicate that copying
increases with task difficulty.
The decrease in guess heterogeneity among participants
(League Coverage) within games, and the accompanying
increase in average score, confirm the intuition that
participant guesses will tend to converge toward similar
higher-quality guesses over the course of a game. The
increasingly negative round-based trends in guess

Figure 7: Normalized League Coverage vs. Round, by
Participant Group Size.
Regression analyses showed that average League
Coverage decreased with game round (F(1,958)=19.3,
p<.0001) and with increasing league size (F(1,78)=20.6,
p<.0001). League Coverage also decreased with increasing
group size (F(1,38)=194, p<.0001), and trends over rounds
were more strongly negative for increasing group size (see
Figure 7).

Discussion
Overall, the results show changes in strategy and
performance, both over time and across group sizes. The
positive relationship of score with game round confirms that
participants were improving during the game. Despite the
fact that a higher maximum score is possible in the larger
league size condition, the significant drop in average scores
in this condition confirms that it was indeed more difficult,
as intended. No qualitative differences were found in the
performances of isolated and grouped individuals.
The Incumbent, Best Round, League, and Copy choice
sources will hereafter be discussed respectively as retention
of guess information, retrieval of information from a
previous best guess, innovation, and imitation. The
increases over rounds in the proportions of retained and
retrieved information and accompanying decreases in
innovation and imitation show that individual solutions
were established over the course of the game, rather than
being produced by random behavior or exclusively by
copying. Larger amounts of innovation and imitation
occurred early on, and less in later rounds when better
guesses were found and smaller changes were made. This is
consistent with the copy when uncertain strategy in that
imitation occurs more often early on in each game when
participants have less experience with the current problem
space. Though innovation decreased over rounds as well,
the increases in retrieval and retention show that individual
learning was taking place, as they function as a kind of

heterogeneity with increasing group sizes show that the
convergence of guesses occurs more quickly and to a greater
extent with larger groups. This is in accordance with the
above-noted increase in copying with larger group sizes.
The fact that average final scores are less than 70% of the
maximum possible score implies that, especially in larger
groups, participants are settling on good but suboptimal
solutions due to insufficient search of the multimodal,
“rocky” problem space. This result agrees with the findings
of Mason, Jones, and Goldstone (2005), that fully-connected
groups (like the ones in this experiment) performed
relatively poorly on a multimodal problem space, while
more sparsely-connected groups (small-world networks)
found optimal solutions more reliably, though more slowly.
The use of differing network structures was not examined
in this experiment, nor were other potentially interesting
manipulations such as adding noise or explicit costs to
information gained by individual or social learning; varying
the “rockiness” of the problem space; changing the problem
space over time; or allowing more complex forms of social
communication between participants. The development of
selective learning strategies and cumulative improvements
are likely to be strongly affected by such variations, and this
paradigm can be extended to pursue them.
Tomasello (1994) contends that human capabilities for
selective and cumulative learning constitute a “ratchet
effect” that allows culture to develop stably across
generations, and that this effect may be unique to humans.
Though this study presents a greatly simplified environment
for such learning, it confirmed and extended several
previous theoretical and empirical results in the field of
social learning. Further understanding of the structure and
dynamics of these phenomena is vital to the study of
technological and cultural development.
