in a Hierarchical Problem Solving Task

To discover whether the effect of the spatial resource
distribution prime also influenced other levels of search in
the lexical task, we analyzed how sequential search
decisions were made within letter sets (see Figure 1). We
first modeled sequential search in a set via competing
multiple cognitive hypotheses about how words were
formed (e.g., edit distance) starting from the letter set or
from previous solutions. We found the best fit to the data
when subjects were assumed to use prior solutions as
starting points for subsequent explorations.
Using this finding, we examined how the two spatial
treatment conditions (correlated/clumpy or not) influenced
search within the lexical problem space. Subjects who
experienced spatially correlated resource distributions had
less similarity between word solutions than subjects who
experienced uncorrelated distributions. However, this was
not the case when subjects only had to harvest (not search
for) resources from the spatial display. We constructed a
model of working memory search using a single parameter
change between treatment groups to explain both letter set
leaving times and inter-item similarity. The model posits
that subjects can leave a letter set at any time, but also
switch from the letter set to work with the previous solution
at a rate related to the same parameter.

Abstract
People may use similar search processes for a variety of
cognitive tasks. The theoretical basis for these generalized
cognitive search processes rests on molecular and
psychophysical evidence for shared processes in cognitive
search across domains—e.g., visual search, problem
solving, spatial search, and decision making. To investigate
the extent of generalized cognitive search processes in a
single task, we studied how subjects’ experiences in 2-D
spatial search influenced their search strategies in a
subsequent lexical problem-solving task (sequential
SCRABBLE) involving hierarchical levels of decision
making. These levels included when to leave a letter set
(patch) and what strategies to use when looking for
subsequent words within a letter set.
When the spatial resource discovery required search (i.e.,
resources were not visible until subjects moved the icon
over them), subjects took longer to leave letter sets if they
had previously experienced spatially-correlated (versus
uncorrelated) resource distributions, replicating a previous
finding. However, when resources were visible, requiring
simply harvesting rather than search, lexical patch leaving
times were unaffected, suggesting that generalized cognitive
search processes were primed via hypothesis-driven
exploration in the spatial search phase.
