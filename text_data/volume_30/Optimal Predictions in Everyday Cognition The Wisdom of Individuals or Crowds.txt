Figure 1: Human and simulation results on eight everyday prediction tasks. The blue squares indicate median human responses
from the experiments of Griffiths and Tenenbaum (2006). The G&T Bayesian-model prediction is indicated by the dashed red
line. The Min2Samples prediction, with g = 0.3, is indicated by the solid green line. The error bars surrounding the human
data and the Min2Samples predictions at the query points denote ±2 standard deviations in experimental outcome. The error
bars for the human data were obtained by G&T via bootstrap sampling; the error bars for Min2Samples were obtained via 100
replications of the simulation experiment.
