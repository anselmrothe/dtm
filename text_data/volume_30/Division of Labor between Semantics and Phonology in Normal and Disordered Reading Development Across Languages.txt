Discussion
The results demonstrate that differences in the role of
semantics in learning to read can be simulated as the result
of differences in the computational demands of learning to
read English and Chinese in the context of the same
functional architecture. This provides an account of the
differential role of pre-existing skills in phonological and
semantic processing in predicting individual differences in
typical reading development. Simulation 2 extends this

phonological and semantic processing for the two writing
