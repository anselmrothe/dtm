the prototypes of corresponding monolingual categories.
   In Study 2, we examined how the boundaries of bilingual
categories were affected by semantic convergence. If
convergence is manifested in category boundaries, bilinguals
could either have more complex categories by incorporating
boundary exemplars of each language in both languages, or
simpler categories by dropping boundary exemplars in both
languages. We found that fewer dimensions were needed to
linearly separate bilingual categories than monolingual
categories. Furthermore, the number of outliers (i.e., objects
more similar to the prototype of another category than to the
prototype of their own category) for bilinguals was smaller
than for monolinguals. Together these results indicate that the
boundaries of bilingual lexical categories are simplified, and             Figure 2. Schematic representation of the monolingual
