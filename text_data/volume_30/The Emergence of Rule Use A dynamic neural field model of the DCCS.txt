spatial dimension is shown along the x-axis in these figures.
The y-axis for the spatial fields shows the strength of
activation at each site in SWM and its LTM. Because the
FWM fields are 2-dimensional, however, we indicate the
degree of activation using the color scheme shown to the
right, where red indicates strong activation.
   There are two different kinds of input to the model. The
target input (see Fig 3) goes into both the SWM and FWM
fields. This sub-threshold input captures the spatial locations
of the sorting trays (input to SWM), as well as the features
located at each spatial position (input into the FWM fields).
In Figure 3 (see also, Fig 1 and 4) the target inputs are a red
