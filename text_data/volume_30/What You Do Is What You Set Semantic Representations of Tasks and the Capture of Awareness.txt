Methods
Participants One hundred and thirty one participants (52
men, 79 women) were tested from a pool of undergraduate
students at Vassar College. All participants ranged between
the ages of 18 to 24, had normal or corrected to normal
vision, and were screened for diagnosed attentional
disorders. The participants were recruited either via an email
informing them about an opportunity to participate or
through an online posting available to the Introductory
Psychology students, who participated for course credit.
Stimuli and Apparatus Participants were presented stimuli
on a computer monitor 30 cm wide and 24 cm tall (Dell
D1025TM), which was set to a resolution of 1024 x 768 and
a refresh rate of 85 Hz. All stimuli were presented using
SuperLab Pro v.1.75 on a Macintosh running OS 9.
   All presented stimuli were black and white. The stimuli
