above studies have focused on patterns of fixation, a variety
of recent studies have examined influences on saccade
trajectories that link these patterns of fixation. This work
has demonstrated that saccade trajectories are influenced by
the presence of information in the environment (e.g. Doyle
& Walker, 2001) as well as a result of remembered
information (Theeuwes, Olivers, & Chizk, 2005); saccades
to visual targets have also been shown to curve in the
presence of both auditory and tactile distractors (Doyle &
Walker, 2002). Saccade trajectories can deviate from
straight lines in a variety of tasks (see Van der Stigchel,
Meeter, & Theeuwes, 2006 for a review). Thus, Van der

and after every 16 trials. In addition, a drift correction
procedure was performed after each trial.
Experimental There were two possible visual targets (left
and right). These targets were always presented in the same
locations. In addition, the hand on the left hand-rest or the
hand on the right hand-rest received stimulation for each
trial. Participants were instructed to place the vibro-tactile
device on their index and middle finger tips. Tactile
stimulation was never delivered to both hands
simultaneously during a trial. Thus, there were four possible
trial types (L/R Target x L/R Tactile Stimulation) within
each condition (crossed or uncrossed hand positions).
   Twenty (20) trials of each type were presented in random
order within tactile/body position condition: hands crossed
and hands uncrossed. In the uncrossed-hands condition,
participants placed their right hand on the right hand-rest
and the left hand on the left hand-rest. In the crossed- hands
condition, participants were instructed to place their right         Figure 2a: Spatially incongruent, uncrossed trial to the left

(crossed or uncrossed-hands) before moving onto the other
condition with the order of conditions counter-balanced
across participants. See Figure 2 for schematic of trial types
and hand position conditions for the left target for both the
crossed and uncrossed-hands conditions.
   A trial commenced with fixation of the fixation cross.
The fixation cross was presented for a variable duration
between 1,000 and 1,500ms as in Groh and Sparks (1996).
Participants were asked to maintain fixation until the
fixation cross disappeared at which time either the left or
right target appeared and tactile stimulation commenced.
Participants were instructed to move their eyes as quickly
and rapidly as possible to the visual target. The visual target

Analysis of Eye Movements
After recording, time points in addition to horizontal (x) and
vertical (y) positions were exported using SR Research
analysis software and converted to ASCII files using the SR
Research Toolbox (Cornelissen, Peters, & Palmer, 2002)
using MATLAB (The Mathworks Guide, M.R. Inc., Natick,
MA, 1998). The remaining analysis took place in
