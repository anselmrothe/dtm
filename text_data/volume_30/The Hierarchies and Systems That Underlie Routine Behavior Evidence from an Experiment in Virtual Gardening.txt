   Notwithstanding the popularity of the Dual Systems
framework it has to be acknowledged that it stands on a
somewhat limited empirical basis. Data with regard to the
normal population comes almost exclusively from diary
studies (Reason, 1979, 1984) or anecdotal collections
(Norman, 1981), and, by virtue of the sole dependent
measure of erroneous actions, is necessarily indirect with
regard to the usually correct performance in highly
overlearned, if complex, tasks. Further complications arise
with respect to the interpretability and comparability of
erroneous actions in the context of non-standardized
everyday behavior, which may involve routinized behavior
interspersed with sporadic control. For example, do slips of
action reflect breakdown at the level of CS, SS, or the
interaction of the two?

The online measure of action selection latencies, moreover,
allowed for more detailed analyses to reveal reliable effects
for other factors within the experimental design. The
transparent pot, for example, was informative only at one
point: because the color of the liquid encoded which
ingredient had been added in subsequence B, it could be
used as a reliable disambiguation cue for the choice between
ingredient C1 and C2 in the last subsequence. As can be
seen in Figure 4, this choice was facilitated when the liquid
color was visible (comparison of get actions over                      Figure 5: Detailed picture of latencies at three interesting
