30th Anniversary Symposia:
Cognitive Science: The Past 30 Years and the Next 30 Years
Organizer: Lawrence W. Barsalou

Symposium II: Trajectories of Cognitive Science
Disciplines

The 2008 Conference in Washington DC represents the
30th anniversary of the seminal conference at UC San
Diego in 1979. In recognition, the Society is sponsoring
back-to-back symposia that address the trajectory of
Cognitive Science from its inception through the present
into the future. The first symposium will address the
trajectories of major perspectives in Cognitive Science;
the second will address the trajectories of major
disciplines. Each speaker will be asked to address:

Dedre Gentner (Psychology)
Kenneth D. Forbus (Artificial Intelligence)
William Bechtel (Philosophy)
Elissa L. Newport (Linguistics)
Douglas L. Medin (Anthropology)

1. What was your perspective/discipline like at the
time of the 1979 conference?

Other perspectives and disciplines not listed explicitly are
likely to be addressed, such as neuroscience, education,
application, formal models, etc. Each speaker will
present for 15 minutes, followed by a 3 minute question
period.

2. How has the perspective/discipline changed over
the past 30 years to what it is today?
3. How do you foresee the perspective/discipline
changing in the next 30 years?

John R. Anderson (Cognitive Architectures)

Discussions about where cognitive science is going are
important to hold periodically. We hope that these
symposia stimulate thought and discussion about the
future, and that they produce positive influence on future
research in the community. We encourage the audience
to contribute their thoughts during the question periods
and in discussion after the symposia.
