means to reduce choice related uncertainties.
   Threshold models take a different view on when people
stop acquiring information (For an excellent discussion see
(Hausmann & Lage, 2008)). The core idea is that people
stop searching for information when their confidence that
one of the decision alternatives outperforms the rest reaches
or exceeds a threshold. In our model we utilize a similar
‘desired level of confidence’ criterion of stopping opinion
seeking. We assume that prospective purchasers stop
reading opinions, i.e. they stop searching for information,
when they have decided which product is best given some
desired level of confidence.

  (iii) Calculate p(t): The distribution of p(t), the probability
        that the product with the current highest mean
        estimated utility will turn out not to be so is Normally
        distributed as is the difference of two Normal
        distributions. Calculating p(t) is then straightforward4.
  (iv) Decision whether to stop the search process and make
        a choice or not: The search process stops either if p(t)
        is bellow a threshold value k, or if all the reviews of all
        of the products have been obtained. In any of the two
        situations the product with the highest mean estimated
        utility is chosen. If it has been decided not to stop the
        search process the model moves on to the next time
        step.
Predictions
The model predicts the relative number of reviews that
people will read given prior beliefs and three parameter
values, k, θ, and τ0. To verify its behavior we created                          Figure 2: Model Predictions: The average number of
