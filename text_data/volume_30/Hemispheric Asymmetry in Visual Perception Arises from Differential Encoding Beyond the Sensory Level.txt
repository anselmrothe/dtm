                          Introduction
The way we analyze and process the global and local forms
of visual stimuli has been extensively examined. Navon
(1977) proposed the "global precedence hypothesis",
suggesting that the global form of a visual stimulus is
unavoidably recognized before the local forms. This effect
was later shown to depend on both the characteristics of the
local and global forms and the hemispheric asymmetry in
the perception of local and global features (Hoffman, 1980).           Figure 1: (a) Stimuli in Sergent’s experiment (1982). “H/L”

   For both the autoencoder networks and the perceptron, the
training algorithm is gradient descent with back-propagation
(Rumelhart et al., 1986). The initial learning rate is 0.05 for
the autoencoder networks and 0.001 for the perceptron, and
is flexible during training: if the error decreases in the
current epoch, the learning rate for the next epoch is the old
learning rate multiplied by 1.01; if the error increases, the
new learning rate is the old learning rate divided by two.
The training stops when the number of training epoch
reaches 1,000 for the autoencoder networks and 1,500 for
the perceptron; the numbers of epochs are chosen so that the
error will have converged before the training stops.                   Figure 6: (a) Modeling results. The error bars show standard
