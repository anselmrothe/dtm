The Interactive Routine as Key Construct in Theories of Interactive Behavior

interleaving of components of different interactive routines is
also observed by Land (1999) who in his study of tea making
notes that movements lead action by about 1/2 s and action
continues after the eye has moved on.

Somewhere between 1/3 and 3 seconds, the cognitive,
perceptual, and motor elements of embodied cognition come
together in dependency networks of constraints to form
interactive routines (Gray, Sims, Fu, & Schoelles, 2006).
Interactive behavior proceeds by selecting one interactive
routine after another or by selecting a stable sequence of
interactive routines (i.e., a method) to accomplish a unit task.
We see interactive routines as the basic elements of embodied
cognition (Ballard, Hayhoe, Pook, & Rao, 1997).

Innate Timing of Interactive Behavior. Recent work
(Joiner & Shelhamer, 2006) suggests the existence of two
timing systems in the brain. A predictive timing system that
operates on events under 3 s and a reactive timing system that
operates above that level.

The selection, assembly, and execution of interactive
routines is typically non-deliberate and non-conscious. The
contrast is between deliberative actions performed for some
purpose of their own versus routine actions performed as a
means rather than as an end.

The Dark Side of Interactive Routines
The soft constraints hypothesis (Gray et al., 2006) claims that
the selection mechanism for interactive routines optimizes
locally, not globally. This local optimization may result in the
human-computer interaction phenomena called the Paradox
of the Active User (Fu & Gray, 2004) in which experienced,
daily users of software consistently fail to optimize their use.
In more basic research settings, this phenomenon is referred
to as stable, suboptimal performance.

I will argue that interactive routines should be viewed as
the key construct in theories of interactive behavior. To this
end, I review data in the following five categories.
The Natural Unit of Interactive Behavior. Newell (1990)
defined immediate behavior as, “responses that must be made
to some stimulus within very approximately one second (that
is, roughly from ~300 ms to ~ 3 sec).” Regularities at this
level of analysis across four cultures led Schledit (1988) to
refer to this interval as a “universal time constant”. The
prevalence of simple object-related acts that take about 3 s to
complete led Land (1999) to suggested that this interval has
“something to do with the intrinsic time scale over which the
brain prefers to operate” (p. 1325).

Unconscious Attention in the Control of Interactive
Routines. Acts of routine interactive behavior are often
considered to represent “automatic” not “controlled”
processing. To the contrary, considerable evidence suggests
that it is controlled (Schwartz, 1995), though not as much as
less routine behaviors. Labeling this phenomena as
unconscious attention (Land et al., 1999) Land concludes
that, “even if the subjects themselves are not attending to the
task, their oculo-motor systems are” (p 1326).
Role of Memory in Guiding Eye Movements during
Interactive Behavior. If the eyes dart around 4 or 5 times per
sec, perhaps internal memory is not needed. Perhaps the
world itself forms an outside memory. I will argue that during
routine interactive behavior the level of encoding required for
getting about in the world is both selective and shallow. It
does not encompass the entire world (no Blu-Ray™ Discs inthe-head) and what is encoded is not encoded for the ages, but
for the instant. It is information for use, not reflection.
Interleaving of Interactive Routines. With experience, the
operations of successfully executed interactive routines
become interleaved thereby increasing the speed and
efficiency with which interactive behavior is executed. This
