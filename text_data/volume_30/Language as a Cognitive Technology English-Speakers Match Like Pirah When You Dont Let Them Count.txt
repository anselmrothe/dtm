Table 1: Statistical comparison of results between Pirahã and Boston participants. Percent correct refers to the total proportion
of trials of a particular type that were correct. Mean error is the average difference between the mean of participants’ responses
and the target value (small values indicate that participants’ estimates were correct across the group, despite being variable for
any individual trial). Mean COV refers to the mean coefficient of variance (mean divided by standard deviation) for a task;
a smaller COV indicates more precise estimates. COV slope is the slope of the best linear fit to the coefficient of variance
for that trial. COV r2 and p-value are the r2 and p-values assigned to the linear trend in the coefficient of variance (larger r2
values indicate growth in the coefficient of variance as the quantities being estimated grow, indicating that analog magnitude
estimation may not be responsible for the errors.
