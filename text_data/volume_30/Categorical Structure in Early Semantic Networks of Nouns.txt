MacArthur Communicative Developmental Inventory
(Fenson, Dale, Reznick & Bates, 1994), Toddler version.
This inventory contains at least 50% of children’s
productive vocabulary by 30 months. Our study used the
130 common nouns from this inventory for which there
were available feature norms from McRae et al., (2005).
These 130 nouns over-represent (with respect to the
inventory as a whole) animals (33 nouns, 25% of the subset
versus 15% of whole inventory) and under-represent food
(17 nouns, 13% of the subset versus 23% of the whole
inventory). Nonetheless, the sample includes a broad array
of nouns across several different superordinate categories.
The features. The features were taken from the feature
norms reported by MacRae et al. (2005). That study
collected feature norm for 541 concepts from a total of 725
adult participants with 30 participants providing features for
each concept. The participants in that study were given
each noun and 14 blank spaces to fill with features and were
prompted to provide physical properties (how it looks,
smells, sounds etc), functional properties or uses, internal
properties, and other pertinent facts. Cree and McRae                Figure 1: The noun graph. Edges represent (w = 2) two or

   Functional and perceptual networks were generated by
creating networks that only used functional or only used
perceptual features. These networks therefore represent
different kinds of semantic information that could structure
the system of early noun categories in different ways.
Figures 2 and 3 present the functional and perceptual
networks, with w = 1 for the functional network and w = 2
for the perceptual network. At w = 1 the perceptual network
is one large component with no visible local structure.
   As is apparent from Figures 2 and 3 (and the associated
threshold w), the perceptual network is far denser than the
functional network. On average, a node in the perceptual
network at the lowest cut-off threshold is connected to 27%
of the other nodes; the average node at the same cut-off
threshold in the functional network is only connected to 5%
of the other nodes. Perceptual information is therefore more
