Results
After learning, we assessed network classification ability by
presenting all 40 training exemplars and computing the NIP
between each output vector and each of the four concept
prototypes. An exemplar was considered to be classified into
the concept yielding the highest NIP. We tallied the number
of correctly classified examples out of ten possible for each of
the four concepts. The numbers of correct classifications were
subjected to a mixed ANOVA where the between-network
factors were prototype flips (1 or 2) and example flips (1, 2,
or 3), and the within-network factor was concept (with 4

dispersed examples. Isolated concepts were less affected by
example dispersion than more crowded concepts were.
Goldstone (1996) reported a similar example-dispersion
effect in experiments where people were trained in
classification, rather than in recognition memory as here.
     Simulation 2: Effects of Defining Features
Simulation 2 was designed to test the idea that defining
features would protect otherwise probabilistic concepts
against the effects of concept crowding and example
dispersion obtained in simulation 1.                                        Figure 4: Defining features protect against concept

Concept Coding and Network Training
After coding concepts as in simulation 1, we gave each
concept two additional binary features that uniquely defined
the concept. Defining features for the four concepts were
coded as (-0.5 -0.5), (-0.5 0.5), (0.5 -0.5), or (0.5 0.5),
respectively, by random assignment without replacement of
these four binary codes to the four concepts. These defining
features were present in each example, and were unaffected
by the probabilistic feature flipping used for the other ten
features. As in simulation 1, we trained 20 networks in each
of the six conditions for 700 or fewer epochs.

After learning, we assessed network classification ability as in
simulation 1. The numbers of correct classifications were
subjected to a mixed ANOVA that included the results of
simulation 1 and an additional between-network factor
representing the presence or absence of defining features. All
four main effects (defining features, prototype flips, example
flips, and concept) were significant, p < .0001, and defining
features interacted with each of the other three variables. As
shown in Figure 4, without defining features, the familiar
signatures of concept crowding were evident. Performance on
examples from the crowded trio concepts was worse than
performance on the isolated concept. With defining features,
performance was nearly perfect for every concept, interaction

Instead, there was perfect performance in isolated
probabilistic concepts with tightly dispersed examples, and
less than perfect performance in all defining-feature concepts
with more widely dispersed examples. It would be interesting
to see how well these simulations predict human results in
these respects.

Concept Coding and Network Training
Concepts were coded as with the defining-features concepts
of simulation 2, using 10 probabilistic features and 2 defining
features. Twenty networks in each of the six conditions were
trained up to a maximum of 100 epochs. These networks
were then compared to the more fully trained networks of                    Figure 8. Characteristic-to-defining features shift for
