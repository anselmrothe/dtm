ber of cues TTB needed to look up for all possible decisions                       since it ignores uncertainty about the value of φ, but with 69 tests at
about heights, weights and speeds of animals, as well as the                       sample size 300 each, this seems a minor issue.

agreement. More importantly, in 53 of the 69 cases (indicated in             (T), and by the question asked, namely height (H), weight (W), or
