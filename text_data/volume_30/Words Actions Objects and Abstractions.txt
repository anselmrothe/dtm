chapter is about one early form of inventiveness that has
long intrigued developmentalists –what is some times
symbolic play, but more narrowly, is also known as “object
substitution in play.” The specific phenomenon consists of
young children using some object –not for what it is --but
as a “stand in” for something else in play – a banana as a
phone, a box as a doll bed, a shoe as a toy car. Piaget
considered object-substitution in play – the using of a
banana as phone, for example – as “symbolic” because the
substituted object could be interpreted as as “standing for”
the real thing. This view that object-substitution is a form
of symbolizing (whatever precisely that means) has been
disputed. Regardless on one’s stand on this issue, object
substitution in play remains a signal developmental
achievement, emerging at the same time (18 to 24 months)
as children’s spoken vocabulary also expands. Perhaps
most critically, object substitution in play is strongly linked
to individual children’s language development with the lack
of this behavior is a strong predictor of significant
subsequent language delay. At one level, this talk is about
how and why these object substitutions may be linked to
