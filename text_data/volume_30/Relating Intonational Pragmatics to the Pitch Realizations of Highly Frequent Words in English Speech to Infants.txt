rise-fall contours than okay, while okay has more falling
tokens.
  To quantify the differences between the 8 words, we first
divided tokens into the categories flat versus contoured. We
used the standard deviation (SD) of each token’s F0
samples: if it fell above 0.275, the token was categorized as
contoured; otherwise, it was characterized as flat. Figure 3
demonstrates that the particular SD threshold mainly affects
the proportions of flat versus contoured tokens rather than
the distributions of different contour types.           At any
particular SD threshold within a reasonable range, the same
differences between words like good and no emerge. We
then further categorized contoured tokens as falls, rises,
rise-falls, fall-rises, or complex. We first normalized each
token’s list of pitch samples by its length, then divided the    Figure 4: Examples of the five contour types. Each token is

occurred in the first region (near the start of the word) and
the F0 minimum occurred in the third region (near the end),
the token was categorized as falling. Conversely, rises had      Table 1: Contour-type distribution and average F0 mean (in

fall-rises were the opposite: minima in the middle and
maxima on either end. Finally, tokens that fell into none of
these categories were deemed complex. Figure 4 illustrates
the three regions and example contours of each type.
   By describing each token as falling, rising, etc., we can
compare the 8 words’ distributions of contour types. Table 1
displays, for each word, the proportion of tokens categorized
in each contour type, and the average mean F0 (converted to
Mels, and z-normalized to control for each mother’s pitch
characteristics). The first thing to notice is the prevalence of
flat tokens across all the word types, which is surprising
considering that we excluded utterance-initial and utterance-
medial tokens (which we would expect to be flatter than
utterance-final tokens).
   The contour-type distributions and F0 means in Table 1
mostly reflect the patterns observed in the F0 plots from
