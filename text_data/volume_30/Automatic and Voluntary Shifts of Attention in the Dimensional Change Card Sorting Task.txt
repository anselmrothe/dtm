  Children were randomly assigned to the Color-to-Shape
condition (in which they were asked to sort by color in the
pre-switch phase and by shape in the post-switch phase) or
to the Shape-to-Color condition (in which they were asked
to sort by shape in the pre-switch phase and by color in the
post-switch phase). Overall, it was expected that switching
from sorting by a less salient dimension to sorting by a more
salient dimension (Color-to-Shape condition) should result
in an automatic shift of attention to the relevant dimension,
thus leading to decreased perseveration compared to the
condition requiring voluntary attention shifting (Shape-to-
Color condition).

                       Experiment 2
Studies of attentional flexibility in 3-year-old children have
traditionally used target objects differing on two dimensions
(e.g.,, color and shape), with each dimension represented by
two values (e.g., red and blue for color; boats and bunnies
for shape). However, learning in natural settings is rarely
narrowed down to a binary choice between two values of a
dimension. What effect would increase in the number of
