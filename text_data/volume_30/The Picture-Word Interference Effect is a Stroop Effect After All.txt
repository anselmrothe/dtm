third congruency condition is a neutral condition (actually,
two neutral conditions, which can be considered identical
for current purposes: one for color naming in which a series
of x-s is written in colored ink, and one for word reading in
which a color word is written in black). This follows a
prototypical experimental setup for the Stroop task (M. O.
Glaser & Glaser, 1982), as well as for picture-word
interference (W. R. Glaser & Düngelhoff, 1984).
   The model performs a typical word reading trial as
follows: In the perceptual encoding stage, the stimulus
features are transferred to the perceptual buffer and at the
same time, the relevant chunks are being retrieved from
memory. This reflects the observation that perceptual cues
can be processed before they enter awareness (Marcel,
1983; Merikle, Smilek, & Eastwood, 2001). Because the
model’s task is to read the word (and ignore the color), the
model retrieves a chunk that encodes the syntactic
properties of the stimulus (that is, the lemma chunk, Levelt,
Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999). For word reading it is not
necessary to retrieve a concept chunk, since words can be
pronounced without active access to the word’s meaning.
   Although perceptual cues can influence processing before
they enter awareness (e.g., Marcel, 1983), it seems that
processing of the complete visual stimulus cannot                             Figure 2: Model predictions and data for the

believe that this model is a convincing theory of the process
of both tasks. The model is constrained by integrating it in a
cognitive architecture that has proven its merits (ACT-R,
Anderson, 2007), and implemented the tasks in a relatively
straightforward way (c.f., Newell and Simon’s “listen to the
architecture” argument, Newell & Simon, 1972). However,
we deviated from the central ACT-R assumptions with
respect to memory retrieval processes, and extended the
standard system with RACE. As we have argued earlier
(Van Maanen & Van Rijn, 2007b), default ACT-R cannot
account for interference patterns found in PWI and Stroop
tasks. In addition, the model parameters were chosen to fit
the Stroop data, and afterwards only the perceptual encoding
speed was adapted to fit the PWI data.
