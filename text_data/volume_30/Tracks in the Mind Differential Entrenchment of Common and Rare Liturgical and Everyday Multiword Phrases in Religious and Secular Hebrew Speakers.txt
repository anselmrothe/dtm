       Praying Customs in Orthodox Judaism
Observant Orthodox Jews are required by their religion to
recite three prayers every day. On Saturdays, which is the
Jewish holy day of the week, the prayers are longer and the
service is substantially different. The prayers recited over the
annual High Holy Days are further prolonged and modified.
Prayers can be recited in privacy, without a quorum, or
preferably in a synagogue, where the service is longer. The
High Holy Days service carries a higher emotional charge
than the more frequent mundane prayers.
   The majority of the Jewish population in Israel is secular.
Generally, secular people do not pray at all, although a
substantial proportion does attend some of the services in the
High Holy Days. In the religious sector, the variability in
praying customs is high: some people attend all services
mentioned above in a synagogue, others pray daily in private,
and some only pray on a weekly basis or even less often.
Furthermore, within the religious sector, there are pronounced
cultural differences between the sexes: traditionally, men are       Figure 1: Mean experiment Score (ExpScore) and standard
