each conceptual category (Martin & Chao, 2001;
Pulvermüller, 2002). These results led to theoretical
proposals such as Pulvermüller’s ‘word web’ idea (2002),
according to which concepts are represented in ‘neuron
webs’ with distinct cortical topographies. This suggests the
need for some form of synchronization between the firing of
these neurons, either in the form of time synchronization or
of frequency synchronizations. ERP studies such as Kiefer
(2001), and later Paz-Caballero and colleagues (2006) found
category specific differences in event-related potentials

reasons for its success are: i) its high classification accuracy
and very good generalization capability with respect to other
classifiers; ii) the limited effort required in architecture
design (i.e., it involves few control parameters) and low
processing time overhead in the learning phase compared to
other algorithms; and iii) its effectiveness in ‘ill-posed’
classification problems (those which have a low ratio
between number of training samples and number of
features).
   The rationale of this classifier is to transform the original
feature space into a space with a higher dimensionality,
where a separation between the two categories by means of
an optimal hyperplane is searched for, defined as:
             f ( x ) = w * ⋅ Φ ( x) + b *          (3)
           *
where w is a vector orthogonal to the separating
hyperplane, b* is a scalar value such that the ratio b*/||w*||
represents the distance of the hyperplane from the origin,
and the function Φ represents a non-linear transformation,
called a ‘kernel function’. The optimal hyperplane is the one
