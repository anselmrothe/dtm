The Feature-based Network
As an initial test of the hypothesis that words learned during
the earliest stages of development have more connections
during later stages—consistent with a model for growth
with preferential attachment—we plotted the mean degree
for each word in the 30-month network against the age of
acquisition for the word (Figure 2). The figure provides no
evidence that words learned earlier are more likely to have
higher connectivity during later stages of development (up                     Figure 3: The log-log plot of the cumulative degree
