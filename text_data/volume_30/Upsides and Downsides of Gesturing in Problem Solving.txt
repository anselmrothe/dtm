  Practice Problem. Participants were first presented with
a practice problem, a two-disk variant of the ToH. The
problem required two moves to complete and was intended
to familiarize the participant with the movement rules and
with how to verbalize their moves while solving.
  Tower of Hanoi Problem. Participants saw either a 4-
disk unsolved (15-move) or a 4-disk partially-solved (7-
move) version of the ToH in paper form. (See Figure 2.)
These particular variants allow for the size of the problem
space to be manipulated using the same number of objects.
  Working Memory Span. Participants received a battery
of three working memory span tasks, including Reading
Span, Operation Span and Symmetry Span, in a separate
session either immediately prior to or immediately
following their ToH session. (For information on these span
tasks, see Kane et al., 2004.) The main purpose of this
battery was to derive a domain-general measure of WMC.                Figure 2. The 15-move (a) and 7-move (b) ToH variants.

Move Analysis
In order to examine the efficiency of solution for correct
solvers, all move attempts were categorized as either legal,
illegal, or restart. Illegal moves were any moves attempted
that violated the rules of the task. Subjects were corrected if
they made illegal moves and had to state a different, legal,
move in order to proceed. Restarts were recorded at any
point that the solver stated that they were beginning again
from the initial problem state.
