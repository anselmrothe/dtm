Heuristic Elicitation
Given the problems with elicitation and the observation that
question format has a large impact on the elicited responses,
it is worth considering more radical departures from the
standard elicitation methods. For example, the work of
Gigerenzer and others (Gigerenzer & Selten, 2001;
Gigerenzer & Todd, 1999) on bounded rationality has
yielded insights into the sorts of questions that the human
mind seems most comfortable working with.
   One observation is that people are better at making                                   Figure 1. MOLE GUI

2001). This is consistent with Winman et al’s (2004)                   For each of the elicitation techniques, the same basic GUI
observation that people are better at evaluating than               layout was used, with only the questions being asked and
