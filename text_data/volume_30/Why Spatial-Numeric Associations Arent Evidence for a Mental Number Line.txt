Section 3: Spoken Magnitude
Finally, each subject completed an explicit magnitude task,
in which ‘yes’ and ‘no’ responses mapped onto whether the
number was less than or equal to 4, or greater than or equal
to 5. Again, median RTs for correct responses were
computed for each target number, response code, and
subject. These data were analyzed in a parity × correctness
× magnitude ANOVA. Figure 4 displays the mean
difference in accurate response times as a function of
number magnitude.
   The full ANOVA revealed a significant interaction of
correct response and magnitude (F(1,32)=19.1, p<0.001),
such that participants responded more quickly when saying
‘yes’ to large numbers and ‘no’ to small numbers. This
pattern held across both even and odd numbers, and, indeed,
there were no significant main effect of parity, nor
