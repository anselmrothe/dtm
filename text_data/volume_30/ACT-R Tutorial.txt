ACT-R (Anderson, Bothell, Byrne, Douglass, Lebiere & Qin,            Rule learning
2004) is a cognitive theory and simulation system for                Models in which new production rules are learned on the

overview of the theory, and on the other hand offer some
direct demonstration of ACT-R models. Although half a day
is not sufficient to cover all material, it can whet the appetite
for and serve as a kick-start to the full ACT-R tutorial that is
available online at http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/. This website also
provides the necessary software, and overview of researchers
using ACT-R, and it has a list of ACT-R publications (many
of them downloadable).
During the tutorial, following Taatgen, Lebiere and Anderson
(2006) four popular research paradigms within ACT-R will
be used as a vehicle both to explain the architecture and to
explain how ACT-R accounts for these phenomena.
Instance learning
Learning by retrieving old experiences from memory, similar
to Loganâ€™s instance theory.                                                   Figure 1: Overview of the ACT-R architecture
