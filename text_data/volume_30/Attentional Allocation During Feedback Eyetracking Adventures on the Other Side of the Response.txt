   The present studies were intended to explore participants'
use of feedback in categorization tasks. We used a standard
categorization paradigm with consecutive trials of stimulus-
response-feedback sequences. Our primary interests were in
understanding how participants allocate their attention to
different aspects of feedback, how this changes throughout
learning, and what this might indicate that they are trying to
do with the information they access.
   We used an eye-tracker to measure participants’ overt
attentional allocation, which allowed us to record its
development throughout feedback. This is an improvement
over the previous practice of inferring attentional allocation
based on participants’ responses, a method that is indirect
and gives no fine-grained temporal information. To our
knowledge, eyetrackers have not previously been used to
study attention during feedback processing. We use mean
total fixation durations to response feedback and to features
of the re-presented stimulus as our primary data. We will
