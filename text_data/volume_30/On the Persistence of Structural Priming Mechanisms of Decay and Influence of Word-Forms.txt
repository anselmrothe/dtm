Short-term memory. The simulation is divided into two
trials: the priming trial and the target trial. At the begin-
ning of the priming trial the network was set to the rest state,
i.e., both nodes in the syntax layer were turned to the OFF
state. In equation 2 this corresponds to the initial conditions
Ei = 0. The external input to each node, Ki is chosen based
on the prime sentence. After this, the equilibrium state is cal-
culated by simulating the dynamical equations of both layers.
Once the network has settled, the bindings are stored in the
STM. This is done by simulating the dynamical equations of
the mutually excitatory networks and a constant external in-
put. This external input is positive (and above threshold) if
both the lexical and structural nodes connected to the binding
node are active (ON), and zero otherwise.                            Figure 2: Experimental design for testing long-term priming and
