I will describe an approach to the recognition of object categories and individual objects, as well
as their meaningful parts structure. Staring with a collection of images containing examples of an
object category, such as 'face', 'car', or 'horse', the scheme constructs a category representation, and
then uses it to identify novel members of the category as well as their parts and sub-parts at
multiple levels. The acquired object representation uses a hierarchy of shared sub-structures called
fragments, selected by maximizing the information delivered for categorization. Recognition of
objects and their parts is obtained by a feed-forward sweep from low to high levels of the
hierarchy, followed by a top-down sweep which exploits global context to resolve local
ambiguities. For the purpose of individual object recognition, fragments representing different
appearances of the same object part are combined in the representation into abstract 'semantic
features', which are invariant to large changes in appearance. I will describe results of learning
novel categories and objects, and discuss future directions at the boundary of vision and cognition.
