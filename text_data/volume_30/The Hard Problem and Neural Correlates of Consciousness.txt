The ‘Hard’ Problem and Neural Correlates of Consciousness

Place (1956) under the heading “the phenomenological
fallacy” in the paper that inaugurated modern materialism.
The error is a version of the notorious sense-datum fallacy,
and precisely the same complaint was made in the
seventeenth century by Arnauld against Malebranche,
repeated later by Reid against Hume, Austin against Ayer,
and onwards (Slezak 2004, 2006a). Significantly, the same
error is the one that Pylyshyn (2003) has repeatedly charged
against pictorial theories of mental imagery and his critique
has been supported by my own experiment on mental rotation
(Slezak 1995, 2002c). Indeed, the seductiveness of the error is
seen in its independent emergence in other domains of
cognitive science such as language (Slezak 2002b) and
decision theory (Slezak 2006b) which thereby serve to
reinforce the Place’s analysis of the ‘Phenomenological
Fallacy’ as the source of perplexity about consciousness.

Keywords: Consciousness; Hard Problem; Neural Correlates.

“Astonishing Hypothesis”?
The puzzle of consciousness arises, as Fodor (2002) puts it
because: “details aside, Lucretius had things about right.
What there really is is atoms-and-the-void, and there’s really
nothing else.” This is the idea that Crick (1994) refers to as
“The Astonishing Hypothesis.” However, perhaps the most
remarkable feature of the staggering intellectual,
philosophical effort devoted to this puzzle is just how unastonishing the raw intuition should be. As Loar (1997),
Lycan (1990), Rorty (1979), Dennett (1991) and Papineau
(2002) have all asked: Why should we expect the subjective
contents of experience themselves to reveal anything of their
physical basis or causal origins. Nevertheless, a burgeoning
literature attests to the seriousness with which the “hard
problem” of consciousness is being approached in
philosophical and scientific research. Hameroff (2007) has
recently defended his conception of the brain as a quantum
computer, and the search for the neural correlates of
consciousness (NCC) is being undertaken as a meaningful, if
optimistic, goal (Koch 2004). I suggest that the vast, growing
literature has nothing new to say since the 17th century – a
symptom of the fact that the puzzle is a pseudo-problem, the
Phenomenological Fallacy (Place 1956). The originality of
my own argument consists, ironically, in pointing out that
there is nothing new to be said.

Phenomenological Fallacy
Although deserving to be seen as a reductio ad absurdum,
these puzzles have been taken to suggest panpsychism. Thus,
Nagel (1979), Chalmers (1996), Hameroff and Penrose
(1996) consider the subjectivity of consciousness to be a
fundamental feature of the world just like space-time, mass,
energy, charge and so on. Apart from entailing that even a
thermostat is conscious, this view makes the search for neural
correlates of phenomenal consciousness in the circuitry of the
brain pointless. If Lycan (1990) is right about the subjectivity
of this sense of “the mental” and its instrinsically perspectival
character, the entire, vast philosophical industry has
succumbed to a “qualia sickness” after slipping on his
“Banana Peel” (Lycan 1990). Lycan blames the slip on an
“inadvertent act-object” model in which sensations are
construed as things which appear to us as if encountered
externally – the error I have characterized as the ‘tripartite
model’ (Slezak 2002a). Jackson (2007, 55) now confesses
that this was his own error when he believed in
epiphenomenal qualia on the basis of his famous Mary
Knowledge Argument. The complaint was made by U.T.
