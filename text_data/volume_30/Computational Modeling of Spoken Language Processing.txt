Computational models provide a means for concretely
specifying theoretical assumptions, and examining their
complex interactions via simulation. Ideally, models help
explain existing data and provide novel predictions that guide
further research. In this tutorial, we will cover principles of
conducting simulations, and assessing model success and
failure. We will use the domain of spoken language
processing for our examples. Models have been particularly
useful in the domains of speech perception and spoken word
recognition, where theories and the signal are both complex.
The TRACE model (McClelland & Elman, 1986) has the
greatest breadth and depth of any model in those domains,
and despite well-known shortcomings, continues to be used
