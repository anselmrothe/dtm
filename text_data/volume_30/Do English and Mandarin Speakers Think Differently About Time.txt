Procedure & Materials
                                                                    horizontally from left to right (as English), were still seven
All participants were tested on the same three questions            times more likely to arrange time vertically than were

and said (for example) “If I tell you that this here is
TODAY, where would you put YESTERDAY?” The
experimenter waited for the participant to point and then
asked “And where would you put TOMORROW?” Three
sets of durations were tested with each participant. In
addition to Yesterday/Today/Tomorrow, participants were
also asked to locate Breakfast and Dinner with respect to
Lunch, and September and October with respect to August.
The central time point was always mentioned first (e.g.,
today), followed by the earlier time point (yesterday), and
then the later time point (tomorrow). No spatial language
was used to describe the time points in either English or
Mandarin (e.g, participants were not asked which is the “up
month” or the “down month” in Mandarin).
Results
  The results are shown in Figure 2. Overall, Mandarin
speakers were more than 8 times more likely to lay out time
vertically than were English speakers, t(68)=3.87, p<.0005.
Across the three temporal durations tested, English speakers
produced horizontal arrangements 95% of the time, and
vertical arrangements only 5% of the time. In contrast,
Mandarin speakers tested on the same stimuli produced
vertical arrangements 42% of the time. This was true even
though no vertical spatial language was used in the
Mandarin testing stimuli. Even when tested entirely in
English, Mandarin-English bilinguals produced vertical
arrangements 37% of the time.
  The proportions of vertical and horizontal points found in
this study correspond well with patterns found in language.
For example, recent analyses of Mandarin corpora reveal
that around 40% of time descriptions in Mandarin contain
vertical metaphors (Chen, 2007).
