                             Abstract
People typically use language expecting the result to be
meaningful comprehension. People also expect their
perceptions of the world to make sense. For example, the
word “up” expresses useful meaning about spatial relations,
just as perceiving distance to an object enables useful spatial
reasoning. Links between language and perception have
been studied in cognitive development (Gelman, Croft, Fu,
Clausner & Gottfried, 1998). We studied the relation of
language and perception in the context of adult visual search
by representing spatial altitude as icons of varying size and
contrast (Palmer, Clausner & Kellman 2008, Figure 1).
   Language can express magnitude in terms of vertical
space: Metaphors in cognitive semantic theory are largely

metaphor MORE IS UP is a correspondence between vertical
space and magnitude. The strength of a metaphor’s semantic
relation varies positively with the number of distinct
conceptualizations expressible in language (Clausner &                                        References
