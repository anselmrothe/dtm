we know little about how infants represent function. One
possibility is that what infants actually represent are actions
that cause outcomes. This assertion is supported by research
showing that 10-month-old infants associate the actions
performed on objects with the surface features of objects
(e.g., you can squeeze round, purple objects), but they do not
associate the outcomes with the surface features of objects
(e.g., round purple objects squeak when acted on) (Perone &            Figure 1. An example of the stimuli used in all experiments
