organization is strongly shaped by experience. On this view,
the functional specialization of brain regions is graded
rather than absolute and reflects the consequences of a set of
general principles and constraints on neural computation.
The consequences of these principles go beyond explaining
why neither pure alexia nor prosopagnosia is entirely pure,
and why the FFA and VWFA show substantial responses to
stimuli other than faces or words, respectively. They also
lead to otherwise unexpected predictions---tested in the
current work with a combination of computational and
empirical studies---concerning the partial co-mingling of
face and word processing, including face recognition
impairments in pure alexic patients, word recognition
impairments in prosopagnosic individuals, and graded
participation of the FFA and VWFA in normal observers.

With the explosive growth of neuroimaging in recent years,
theorizing within cognitive neuroscience has increasingly
moved away from a search for domain-general principles
toward a view in which the brain mechanisms supporting
cognition are organized into distinct modules dedicated to
narrowly-defined functions. A clear case in point concerns
visual recognition of faces and words, where neuroimaging
observations of selective activation for faces in the fusiform
face area (FFA), and for words in the visual word form area
(VWFA), dovetail with classic neuropsychological findings
of selective deficits in face recognition (prosopagnosia) and
in word recognition (pure alexia) following damage to these
areas. The current research examines and elaborates an
alternative perspective---that cognitive behavior is
supported, not by dedicated modules, but by a highly
distributed and interactive cortical network whose
