Given the delicate nature of the phenomenon we are trying to
study, care had to be taken to make sure no extraneous
sources of stimulation occurred during the experiment. One
participant was heard singing during the study, resulting in
the exclusion of her data as well as that of two other
participants who were run at the same time (in separate, but
adjacent rooms) as they may have heard her. Several other
participants had to be excluded due to a loud radiator in one
experimental room and other unforeseen circumstances
arising during the study. Consequently, only data from 36
participants (11 females and 25 males) was used for the
analysis, 18 in each condition.
