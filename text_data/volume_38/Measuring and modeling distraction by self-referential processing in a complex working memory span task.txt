letter stimulus, which the participants could use to rehearse.
We hypothesized that distraction caused by the processing
in the SRP condition interfered with this rehearsal process.
During this period, distraction competes with rehearsal.
Because the processing phase ended if there was less than
700ms remaining for a to be presented stimulus, this time
was added to the inter-trial interval, making this phase on
average 1.3s in duration.
   Distraction was modeled as follows. During the
processing phase of the task, memory retrievals are required
to answer either the shoebox question or the self-referential
question. The assumption of the model is that self-
referential words are associated with operators that elaborate
these words. Elaboration involves additional memory
retrievals, and representing the results in working memory,
which in its turn can prime additional elaboration.
   The probability that elaboration happens is much larger in             Figure 3: Comparison of partial-credit score between the
