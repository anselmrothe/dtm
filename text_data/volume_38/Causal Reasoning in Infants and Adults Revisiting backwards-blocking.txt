   perception and causal reasoning are underpinned by a
   Bayesian mechanism, associative mechanism, or both. It has
   been suggested that a Bayesian mechanism, rather than an
   associative mechanism, underpins causal reasoning because
   such a mechanism can better explain the putative backward-
   blocking finding in children and adults (e.g., Sobel,
   Tenenbaum, & Gopnik, 2004). In this paper, we report two
   experiments to examine to what extent infants and adults
   exhibit backward blocking and whether humans’ ability to
   reason about causal events is underpinned by an associative
   mechanism, a Bayesian mechanism, or both.
