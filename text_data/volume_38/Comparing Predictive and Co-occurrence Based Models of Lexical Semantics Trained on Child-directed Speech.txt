Results
Figure 1 shows the accuracy of the model with different
parameter considerations in the categorization task. As
expected, the skipgram architecture learned similarity
between the words better than the cbow architecture,
resulting in superior categorization performance.
Interestingly, considering a larger context window size
(changing from 2 to 12 context words from each side of the
target word) did not enhance the performance of the cbow
model significantly. On the other hand, the skipgram model
did benefit from more context words. When compared
against the cbow results, this suggests that the size of our
corpus is small for the connectionist model to learn the
similarities between the words in our categorization dataset.

Setup of the Models
We trained each model with its optimal parameter settings.
As we found in Experiment 1, for W2V this meant using the
skipgram architecture with a window size of 12 and 200
nodes for the hidden layer. For comparison, the optimal
performing NDL model had a window size of 3, and like
W2V, performed better predicting contexts from words
rather than vice-versa (Shaoul et al., 2016). NDL has no
hidden layer, and therefore is not comparable in terms of
vector size. Since the co-occurrence models do not use
error-driven learning, direction (word predicting context vs.
context predicting word) was not a feature of these models.
However, these models were both trained using a window          Figure 4. Mean classification accuracy on the 30 different
