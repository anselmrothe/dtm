    Rules and Respect           It is very important that children learn to respect adults, such as parents and teachers.
                                It is important for young children to learn to control their impulses (e.g., waiting when told to
                                wait).
                                Children should be taught to be grateful to their parents.
                                Children should not be punished for breaking small rules.*
                                Parents should follow their children’s lead rather than imposing structure in the form of rules.*
                                Young children should be allowed to make their own decisions, such as what to eat for dinner.*
    Affection and               Parents need to provide safe and loving environments for their children.
    Attachment                  Holding and cradling babies is important for forming strong bonds between parent and child.
                                Children should be given comfort and understanding when they are scared or unhappy.
                                Parents do not need to talk to their child about his or her emotions.*
                                Children become spoiled if they receive too much attention from parents.*
                                Too much affection can make a child weak.*
    Early Learning              Children can learn about things like good and bad behavior from a very early age.
                                Young children can teach themselves things by exploring and playing.
                                Babies repetitive behaviors (e.g., banging a cup on the table) are a way for them to explore
                                cause and effect.
                                It is not helpful for adults to explain the reasons for rules to young children because they won’t
                                understand.*
                                Children don’t need to learn about numbers and math until they go to school.*
                                Reading books to children is not helpful if they have not yet learned to speak.*

                              A) More structured time in which children are taught lessons and skills.
                              B) More time spent memorizing things that will be helpful later, such as the ABCs.
                              C) More time for children to play outside and with toys.*
