    Even though there is accumulating evidence on how
people talk and gesture about time, detailed investigations of
temporal expressions in both speech and gesture in
languages other than English are still insufficient and there
is room for new findings. In languages, several categories
such as duration, tense, sequence time, deictic time, and
metaphors are used to define time (Le Guen & Balam,
2012). This paper focuses on two time concepts: duration
and spatial metaphors to express time.
