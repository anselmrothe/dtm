sible ABX triplets of utterances from a language pair, where
A corresponds to an utterance of L1, B corresponds to an ut-
terance of L2, and X can be either L1 or L2. For each triplet,
X is classified as belonging to L1 or L2 based on whether the
cosine distance between X and A is smaller or greater than the
distance between X and B. The percentage of correct classi-
fications serves as an index of the discriminability between
the two languages. Additionally, we performed a Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) for each language pair as a way
of visualizing the variance and distance of the i-vectors that
compose each language.

Habituation task
We ran the habituation model for both language pairs, and
within each pair we tested the model with both possible lan-
guages in the initial habituation phase. The average amount
of steps to reach habituation was similar for all languages
(French: 2.1, English: 1.8, Spanish: 1.7, Catalan: 1.7).
   As previously observed in infant experiments, the results
of 100 trials for each test (presented in Figure 1) show a dif-

pairs. In the case of Spanish-Catalan (bottom panels), the p-
