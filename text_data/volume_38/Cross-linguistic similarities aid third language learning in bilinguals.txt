Abstract
Learning a new language involves significant vocabulary acquisition. Learners can accelerate this process by relying on
words with native-language overlap, such as cognates. For
bilingual third language learners, it is necessary to determine
how their two existing languages interact during novel language learning. A scaffolding account predicts transfer from
either language for individual words, whereas an accumulation account predicts cumulative transfer from both languages.
To compare these accounts, twenty English-German bilingual
adults were taught an artificial language containing 48 novel
written words that varied orthogonally in English and German
wordlikeness (neighborhood size and orthotactic probability).
Wordlikeness in each language improved word production accuracy, and similarity to one language provided the same benefit as dual-language overlap. In addition, participants’ memory
for novel words was affected by the statistical distributions of
letters in the novel language. Results indicate that bilinguals
utilize both languages during third language acquisition, supporting a scaffolding learning model.

Introduction
Knowledge of multiple languages is a desirable skill. Eighty
percent of Americans (Rivers, Robinson, Harwood, & Brecht,
2013) and 84% of Europeans (European Commission Special Barometer, 2006) believe that adults should be fluent in
a second language, but multilingual rates are far lower than
desired levels. Bilingualism in the United States is estimated
at 20-26% (United States Census Bureau, 2007), and even
in the European Union, where primary and secondary school
instruction in two foreign languages is widespread, only 56%
of adults report fluency in a second language (European Commission Special Barometer, 2006).
One factor that makes language learning difficult for adults
is prior language knowledge. In particular, first language (L1)
experience tends to sharpen the mind to features and regularities of future L1 input, such as word forms (Schmitt, 1997).
A consequence of this linguistic sharpening is that adults become particularly attuned to learning new vocabulary in their
native language (Long & Shaw, 2000). Throughout life, people rapidly learn new vocabulary; a professional psycholinguist quickly learns words like morpheme, electroencephalogram, or aphasia. Because of their similarity to existing
words and patterns, acquisition comes relatively seamlessly,
even to people who may have struggled to learn a foreign language.
While linguistic sharpening can facilitate acquisition of
native-like words, it can also interfere with learning of words

that do not match native language patterns. This has important implications for novel language learning, because lexical
similarity drops across languages. Written English words,
for example, have on average 5-7 times fewer neighbors
(i.e., words that differ in a single letter) in related languages
like Dutch, French, German, or Spanish than they do English neighbors (Marian, Bartolotti, Chabal, & Shook, 2012).
Thus, when attempting to learn a new language, the L1 is less
likely to confer a benefit.
When overlap between languages does exist, it can be a
powerful tool. For example, cognates, which overlap in both
form and meaning across languages, are easier to acquire (De
Groot & Keijzer, 2000). Partial similarity is also beneficial,
with learners better able to retrieve words with L1-familiar
patterns during immediate recall (Storkel, Armbrüster, &
Hogan, 2006; Thorn & Frankish, 2005). Novel words’ L1
overlap can be characterized in several different ways; two
useful metrics are neighborhood size and orthotactic probability. A broad definition of a word’s neighborhood size is the
number of known words that differ from it in the substitution,
addition, or deletion of a single letter, and orthotactic probabilities calculate how often individual letters or sequences of
letters are used in a language.
Complete word learning is a complex, protracted process,
and only after a period of memory consolidation is a new
word fully integrated into the lexicon (Gaskell & Dumay,
2003). Acquisition of a word’s form, though, occurs relatively quickly, making form a useful target for investigating
the initiation of word learning. The mechanism by which
form similarity benefits language learning is the focus of the
current investigation. In this study, we compare two possible
models for how long-term knowledge affects novel vocabulary learning: the Scaffolding and the Accumulation models.
The Scaffolding model predicts that the ability to create
a direct association between a newly-encountered word and
an existing word or concept drives memory strength. Novice
learners rely heavily on L1 translations during L2 vocabulary
learning (Liao, 2006; Schmitt, 1997), which anchors the relatively weak novel word to a strong existing memory. In the
Revised Hierarchical Model of bilingual language processing, these word-to-word associations are strongest at the onset
of L2 learning (Kroll & Stewart, 1994). Beyond translation
equivalents, other lexical associations can be used to remember discrete aspects of a word. For example, the keyword
learning method (Shapiro & Waters, 2005) is a pedagogical

2735

approach that emphasizes using a known word as a form intermediary between a novel word and its meaning (e.g., the
word steel can be used to remember the phonological form of
the French word stylo, meaning pen). A novel word with a
more native-like form is more likely to have closely related
L1 keywords available that the learner can select from to create a personally meaningful association. The scaffolding account thus emphasizes the learner’s ability to directly utilize
their existing linguistic framework during language acquisition.
In contrast, the Accumulation model proposes that a novel
word’s consistency with lexicon-wide patterns affects the fidelity with which it is represented in short-term memory and
retrieved from long-term memory. When a new word is first
encountered, it is vulnerable to disruption, but rehearsal processes maintain the trace in the phonological loop until it
can be stored in memory. How well information is represented and maintained in the phonological loop is affected
by interactions with prior knowledge, as detailed in Baddeley’s Working Memory model (Baddeley, 1986). As applied to word learning, this long term knowledge may be
used to enhance the strength of the initial temporary storage during encoding (Gathercole, 2006). Novel words with
more native-like features are easier to repeat and maintain
in working memory, because the sequencing of their letters
or sounds is more predictable. In addition, newly-learned
words that are composed of high probability patterns can benefit more from redintegration, the process of reconstructing a
partially decayed short-term memory using long-term knowledge. Thus, a word that was incompletely encoded may nevertheless be accurately produced, reinforcing the target representation. To again use the French word stylo as an example, it contains common English bigrams st and lo, and the
frequency of these features can facilitate accurate encoding
and retrieval. These sub-lexical effects are distinct from the
one-to-one whole word associations that drive learning in the
scaffolding model.
In order to compare the Scaffolding and Accumulation
models of word learning, we make use of a population with
unique language experience and investigate acquisition of a
third language in bilingual adults. We taught English-German
bilinguals 48 words in an artificial language that varied orthogonnaly in their similarity to English and German. The
two models make different predictions for how the three
languages interact during word learning and retrieval. The
scaffolding account predicts comparable learning benefits for
novel words that resemble one or both known languages, because a single lexical-level link to existing knowledge is sufficient to advance learning. For each new word, quality links
in either language may be available, but only one is utilized.
In contrast, the accumulation account predicts tiered learning, where novel words that resemble both known languages
are learned better than those that resemble a single language.
This pattern is driven by cumulative sublexical frequency effects from each known language.

Methods
Participants
Twenty English-German bilinguals participated for monetary
compensation. Informed consent was obtained in accordance
with Northwestern University’s IRB. After the experiment,
participants completed the Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q, Marian, Blumenfeld, &
Kaushanskaya, 2007) to assess proficiency, age of acquisition, and percentage of current usage for each language. Participants also completed the LexTALE in English and German, which assesses vocabulary knowledge based on lexical
decision accuracy (LexTALE, Lemhöfer & Broersma, 2012)
(Table 1).

Materials
Forty-eight orthographic CVCC words were created in an
artificial language. The novel words’ English and German
wordlikeness were calculated as composite scores of English
and German orthographic neighborhood size and orthotactic
probability (sum of grams and sum of bigrams), calculations
from CLEARPOND (Marian et al., 2012), and English and
German word similarity judgments obtained from EnglishGerman bilinguals (N = 10, ratings on scales of 1-5). Words
were divided into four groups based on median splits of the
English and German wordlike composites. Fourteen words
had both high English and high German wordlikeness (E+G+,
e.g., nist or baft), ten had high English but low German wordlikeness (E+G- e.g., sumb or gonk), eleven had low English
but high German wordlikeness (E-G+ e.g., gach or kenf ), and
the remaining thirteen had low English and German wordlikeness (E-G- e.g., gofp or kowm). Each novel word was
paired with a color line drawing from the revised Snodgrass
and Vanderwart picture set (Rossion & Pourtois, 2004). Pictures were chosen to be highly recognizable (naming reliability: M = 99.1%, SD = 2.0%, Bates et al., 2003), and did
not overlap orthographically or phonologically in English or
German with their paired novel-language words. The names
of pictures used in each of the four conditions did not differ
on lexical frequency, orthographic or phonological neighborhood size, or gram, bigram, phoneme, or biphone probabilities in English or German (calculations from CLEARPOND,
Marian et al., 2012).

Procedure
Participants began training with a single exposure block of
48 randomized trials to familiarize them with the novel language. In each exposure trial, a picture was presented in the

2736

center of the computer screen, and the written novel-language
target appeared below the picture. Trials advanced automatically after two seconds. Following the exposure block, participants performed five blocks of word recognition with feedback, and five blocks of word production with feedback, alternating between the two tasks.
Word learning: Recognition. In 48 recognition trials, a
random target picture and three randomly selected foil pictures were displayed in the four corners of the screen, and
the written target word appeared in the center of the screen.
The participant clicked on the picture that matched the word;
accuracy and response time were recorded. After making a
response, the three foils disappeared, and the target picture
and written word remained onscreen for 1000 ms to facilitate
continued learning, followed by a 1000 ms inter-trial interval.
Word learning: Production. In 48 production trials, a random target picture was presented in the center of the screen.
The participant typed the name of the picture in the new language and accuracy was recorded (RTs were not analyzed due
to the continuous response nature of typing in the task). After
making a response, the picture and the participant’s answer
remained on the screen, and the correct name of the target
was printed below the participant’s response for 1000 ms as
corrective feedback, followed by a 1000 ms inter-trial interval. After completing all 48 trials, a new testing block of
recognition and production began. After the fifth series of
recognition and production blocks the experiment concluded.

ual deviances from the global mean and condition means. The
effects of individual differences in English and German background on learning were assessed by correlating each measure with individuals’ random effect estimates in each model.
The base Level-2 model included all time terms, fixed effects of English and German proficiency, and random effects
of participant and participant-by-condition on all time terms.
Additional Level-2 models were built that added three fixed
effects of English wordlikeness (E+/E-), German wordlikeness (G+/G-), and their interaction to each time variable in
turn. A significant improvement in model fit (a Chi-squared
test on the change in model fit using -2LogLikelihood) indicates an effect of condition on independent properties of the
curve (i.e., height, slope, or curvature). Parameter-specific
p-values were estimated by using a normal approximation,
treating the t-value from the model as a z-value.

Results
Word Production
Word production accuracy improved from 10.3% (SD = 14.8)
to 66.3% (SD = 26.1) over blocks one to five.

Data Analysis
Accuracy in each task was automatically scored by the computer. Response times in the recognition task were measured
from the onset of the display until the participant clicked on a
picture. RT analyses were performed on correct responses
only, in order to control for accuracy differences between
blocks and conditions. Outlier RTs within each combination
of Block and Condition were identified and replaced with the
threshold value (Mean + 2SD).
Change across blocks in recognition accuracy and RT, and
in production accuracy was analyzed using growth curve
analysis (Mirman, Dixon, & Magnuson, 2008), a form of
multilevel regression that simultaneously estimates the effects
of individuals and of experimental manipulations on timecourse data. Accuracy and RT were fit with two model levels. The Level-1 submodels captured the effect of time on
changes in the dependent measure over the course of training using second-order orthogonal polynomials. The intercept term describes the overall height of the curve, the linear term reflects the slope, and the quadratic term reflects the
curvature. The Level-2 submodels capture the effects of experimental manipulations and individuals on each of the time
terms present in the Level-1 model through a combination of
population means, fixed effects, and random effects. In the
current study, the fixed effects corresponded to English- and
German-wordlikeness. The random effects captured individ-

Figure 1: Novel word production accuracy (dots indicate observed values, and vertical lines standard error) and best fit
quadratic growth curve models. Both English and German
wordlikeness increased overall accuracy (intercept height),
but the two factors did not have an additive effect.
The production accuracy model (Figure 1) was improved
by adding English and German wordlikeness to the intercept
(∆LL = 25.82, χ2 (3) = 51.64, p < .001) and to the quadratic
term (∆LL = 4.89, χ2 (3) = 9.78, p < .05). The overall height
of the curve was increased by English (Estimate = 0.218, SE
= 0.023, p < .001) and by German wordlikeness (Estimate
= 0.087, SE = 0.023, p < .001), and there was a significant
interaction between the two terms (Estimate = -0.117, SE =
0.033, p < .001). The combination of the two terms revealed
that whereas Englishlikeness improved accuracy by 21.8%
and Germanlikeness improved accuracy by 8.7% relative to
the unwordlike baseline, they combined non-additively, as
the E+G+ double-wordlike condition was only 18.8% above
baseline. Additionally, the benefits of English and German

2737

wordlikeness were not equivalent, as the height of the learning curve for E-G+ words was significantly lower than both
the E+G- words (Estimate = 0.131, SE = 0.023, p < .001) and
the E+G+ words (Estimate = 0.101, SE = 0.023, p < .001).
The curvature of the learning gains over time (i.e., the
quadratic term in the model) was significantly affected by Englishlikeness (Estimate = -0.098, SE = 0.033, p < 0.01), but
not by Germanlikeness (Estimate = -0.045, SE = 0.033, n.s.).
The baseline quadratic term was also not significant (Estimate
= -0.029, SE = 0.031, n.s.), and together, these results indicate that whereas accuracy gains between blocks were nearly
linear for baseline words, Englishlikeness had a non-linear
effect on change in accuracy over time, with the largest accuracy gains between blocks occurring earlier during training.

Word Recognition
Participants’ recognition accuracy improved from 61.6% (SD
= 19.0) in the first block to 98.4% (SD = 3.7) in the fifth block.
RTs became faster over time, from 3325 ms (SD = 593) in the
first block to 2208 ms (SD = 493) in the fifth block.
The word recognition accuracy model (Figure 2) was improved by adding the wordlike predictors to the intercept
(∆LL = 4.52, χ2 (3) = 8.10, p < .05). Englishlikeness raised
the overall height of the curve (Estimate = .0.036, SE = 0.016,
p < .05), reflecting consistently higher accuracy for the Englishlike words compared to un-Englishlike words of 3.6%
over the course of training. For recognition RT (Figure 3),
there was a significant improvement to the base model by
adding English and German wordlikeness to the intercept
(∆LL = 22.16, χ2 (3) = 44.32, p < .001). English wordlikeness reduced RT relative to baseline (Estimate = -0.406, SE
= 0.061, p < .001), and there was a marginal decrease in RT
by German wordlikeness (Estimate = -0.109, SE = 0.061, p
< .1). Novel words that resembled English were thus correctly identified 406 ms faster than baseline words, whereas
words that resembled German were identified 109 ms faster
than baseline, with no interaction between the two factors.
These wordlike increases were stable across training, even as
RTs globally decreased by 1117 ms from blocks one to five.

Language Proficiency
The random effect terms in the accuracy and RT models quantify how much individual participants’ performances deviated
from the group mean. We correlated the random effects with
measures of language aptitude and relative language balance.
Relative differences in proficiency were associated with
differences between Englishlike and Germanlike learning
rates. Specifically, for production accuracy, higher proficiency in English relative to German was associated with
larger slopes (faster learning rate) for the Englishlike relative to the Germanlike words, and conversely, higher relative
German proficiency was associated with a faster learning rate
for the Germanlike words (r = .479, R2 = .217, p < .05).
Overall proficiency was associated with recognition accuracy. English vocabulary size (LexTALE score) was correlated with a higher intercept (r = .647 ,R2 = .419, p < .01) and

and best fit quadratic growth curve models. English
wordlikeness increased overall accuracy (intercept height).

values, and vertical lines standard error) and best fit quadratic

a shallower slope (r = -.624, R2 = .389, p < .01). English and
German self-rated proficiencies were each marginally correlated with higher intercepts (English proficiency, r = .423, R2
= .179, p < .1; German proficiency, r = .407, R2 = .221, p <
.1) and shallower slopes (English proficiency, r = -.470, R2
= .166, p < .05; German proficiency, r = -.433, R2 = .187, p
= .05). In each case, greater language knowledge increased
accuracy; the shallower slopes reflect reaching ceiling performance.

Discussion
In the current study, we found that lexical similarity to a single known language improved bilinguals’ learning of novel
written words as much as simultaneous overlap with two
known languages. These results indicate that vocabulary
learning in a third language benefits from each language, and
that bilinguals can flexibly transfer L1 and L2 knowledge to
the L3 as appropriate at early stages of instruction. The lack

2738

of an additive learning benefit for words with close lexical
neighbors and familiar patterns in both languages suggests
that early vocabulary transfer may occur through a process
of linking novel words to anchors in a single language. This
process most closely resembles the scaffolding model of word
learning, with limited evidence for the accumulation model.
Two tasks, word recognition and production, were used to
asses complementary aspects of novel word learning. The
recognition task probed the formation of word-meaning links,
whereas the production task assessed recollection of an exact L3 written word form. Recognition accuracy was high
even after a single training exposure. In the first block,
participants recalled roughly 30 of the 48 pairs correctly,
and quickly approached ceiling performance. English, but
not German, wordlikeness increased overall accuracy across
training relative to baseline words. In addition, participants
with larger English vocabularies performed better on the task,
with higher accuracies across training. Marginal correlations
between individuals’ proficiency in either language and accuracy suggest the possibility of a generalized vocabulary size
benefit on recognition learning. For word recognition, there is
more support for an effect of English similarity than of German; this difference between languages reflects the overall
higher English proficiency in our sample. Because the novel
words were presented in their entirety during the recognition task, accurate performance depended not on memory for
wordforms, but on the link between form and meaning.
The production task, in contrast, was designed specifically
to probe participants’ memories for the actual written forms
in the artificial language. With only a single picture prompt,
the participant’s task was to type the matching word from
memory. In this task, we saw evidence for strong effects of
wordlikeness both in English and in German. All three wordlike conditions (E+G+, E+G-, and E-G+) had higher curve
heights than the baseline (E-G-) words, indicating higher accuracy throughout the experiment. However, the combination of English and German wordlikeness was not additive,
as the E+G+ words were no different from the better of the
two single-wordlike conditions, E+G-. This pattern of results
provides support for the scaffolding account, by which the
novel words received a benefit to learning if they overlapped
with at least one of bilinguals’ known languages, but received
no additional benefit for overlapping both languages.
Bilingual third language learners appear to be especially
sensitive to perceived overlap, and will transfer vocabulary
knowledge from their two languages preferentially based on
typological similarity, regardless of other factors like age of
acquisition (Cenoz, 2003). As a result, we would expect
participants in the current study to transfer knowledge from
the language of overlap for E+G- or E-G+ words, and either language for E+G+ words. In post-experiment debriefings, 95% of participants reported using a keyword learning
method (Shapiro & Waters, 2005) to learn words’ meanings
by creating a mental image linking the meaning and word via
a similarly spelled existing word. Participants’ use of En-

glish and German anchors tended to overlap with the target
word’s proscribed category. For example, to learn that the
novel E+G- word sumb meant fork, one participant imagined
counting the sum total of forks in a drawer. Another participant learned that that the E-G+ word kenf meant goat by
thinking of a goat eating senf, the German word for mustard. Words that resembled both English and German, like
the word duch meaning eyeglasses, were sometimes learned
through an English linking word (a duck wearing glasses),
but other times a German link (using glasses to read a buch,
the German word for book). By not limiting themselves to
a single language of transfer, learners were able to maximize
the benefits they gained from their existing knowledge. This
pattern would also predict language-specific benefits for English or German monolinguals, and comparable performance
between monolingual and bilingual groups on dual-overlap
E+G+ words.
While both languages provided benefits to memory for
novel word forms, the sizes of the effects were not equivalent. English wordlikeness, compared to German, had a larger
effect on overall production accuracy, and led to a slightly
different curvature over the course of training. These patterns are consistent with participants’ proficiency asymmetry. Although participants were highly proficient in both languages, all participants were currently living and working in
the United States, and had slightly higher English proficiency.
Second language proficiency can affect the degree to which it
influences third language learning (Hammarberg, 2001), and
accordingly, the largest accuracy gains were seen for English
wordlikeness. At the individual level, however, we found that
learning patterns were influenced by relative proficiencies in
English and German. Bilinguals with higher proficiency in
English learned to produce the Englishlike words at a faster
rate than the Germanlike words, while the opposite was true
for those with higher proficiency in German. This difference
may reflect either the relative ease of acquisition of individual words, or an attention allocation strategy that prioritized
words resembling the learner’s dominant language.
To conclude, we found evidence for effects of wordlikeness in each of a bilinguals’ two languages on third language
orthographic word learning. Memory for word forms was
often improved by linking novel vocabulary to existing lexical anchors in either language, depending on the similarity
of the novel word to lexical patterns in English and German. Importantly, a novel word’s similarity to both of a bilingual’s known languages does not provide an additional learning benefit beyond similarity to a single language, suggesting that orthographic knowledge does not necessarily combine additively during third language learning. These results
provide support for the scaffolding account of word learning, in which existing language knowledge provides a framework upon which novel words in another language can be
built, accelerating early stages of language acquisition. The
persistance of these similarity effects on lexical integration
and long-term retrieval will be a critical test in applying these

2739

findings to language instruction. Foreign language instruction has long placed a premium on total immersion, but there
is growing evidence that comparisons to the native language
can benefit learning (Lin, 2015). We demonstrate here the
learning benefits to be gained by utilizing areas of overlap
between a known and a novel language.
