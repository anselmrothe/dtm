Accuracy in each task was automatically scored by the com-

from the onset of the display until the participant clicked on a

only, in order to control for accuracy differences between
blocks and conditions. Outlier RTs within each combination           Figure 1: Novel word production accuracy (dots indicate ob-

the E+G- words (Estimate = 0.131, SE = 0.023, p < .001) and
the E+G+ words (Estimate = 0.101, SE = 0.023, p < .001).
   The curvature of the learning gains over time (i.e., the
quadratic term in the model) was significantly affected by En-
glishlikeness (Estimate = -0.098, SE = 0.033, p < 0.01), but
not by Germanlikeness (Estimate = -0.045, SE = 0.033, n.s.).
The baseline quadratic term was also not significant (Estimate
= -0.029, SE = 0.031, n.s.), and together, these results indi-
cate that whereas accuracy gains between blocks were nearly
linear for baseline words, Englishlikeness had a non-linear
effect on change in accuracy over time, with the largest accu-
racy gains between blocks occurring earlier during training.           Figure 2: Novel word recognition accuracy (dots indicate ob-

   The word recognition accuracy model (Figure 2) was im-
proved by adding the wordlike predictors to the intercept
(∆LL = 4.52, χ2 (3) = 8.10, p < .05). Englishlikeness raised
