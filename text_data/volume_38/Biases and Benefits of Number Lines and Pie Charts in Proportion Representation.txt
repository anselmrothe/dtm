Abstract

Huttenlocher, 2008), and adults (Fabbri, Caviola, Tang,
Zorzi, & Butterworth, 2012; Matthews & Chesney, 2015)
suggests that even by a young age, we can understand
proportional information when presented non-symbolically.
However,
mapping
between
these
non-symbolic
representations and symbolic representations (fractions,
decimals) is not a trivial task. For example, the bipartite
structure of fraction notation can lead people to treat
fractions as two distinct whole numbers, rather than a
coherent unit (e.g., Ni & Zhou, 2005) and superficial
similarities between whole number and decimal notation can
lead children to make place-value errors, like “longer
decimal = larger value” (e.g., 0.313>0.43; Desmet,
Gregoire, & Mussolin, 2010). Despite the presence of
whole number biases in both fraction and decimal notation,
differences have been noted in the affordances of these
distinct representations. For example, the bipartite format of
fraction notation has been shown to better convey discrete,
part-whole information (DeWolf, Grounds, Bassok, &
Holyoak, 2014; Rapp, Bassok, DeWolf, & Holyoak, 2015).
Decimal notation, on the other hand, has been shown to
better convey continuous numerical magnitude information
(DeWolf et al., 2014; Hurst & Cordes, 2015), making it
more closely align with continuous quantities (Rapp, et al.,
2015). However, how these properties of the symbolic
representations (i.e., continuous magnitude versus discrete
part/whole information) align with conventional spatial
representations and in turn impact adults’ ability to use and
manipulate proportional information in both symbolic and
spatial forms is an open question.
Spatial representations, particularly pie charts and number
lines, are commonly used in educational instruction and in
every day communication of proportional information (e.g.,
pie charts in investment portfolios). Thus, investigating how
these spatial, non-symbolic representations are interpreted
and manipulated could shed light on numerical
representation and educational practices. Although
magnitude information in both pie charts and number lines
can be represented in a continuous fashion (meaning, not
broken up into unit pieces), these spatial representations are
perceptually distinct and may offer different advantages and

In two experiments, we investigate how adults think about
proportion across different symbolic and spatial
representations in a comparison task (Experiment 1) and a
translation task (Experiment 2). Both experiments show
response patterns suggesting that decimal notation provides a
symbolic advantage in precision when representing numerical
magnitude, whereas fraction notation does not. In addition,
pie charts may show some advantages above number lines
when translating between representations. Lastly, our findings
suggest that the translation between number lines and
fractions may be particularly error-prone. We discuss what
these performance patterns suggest in terms of how adults
represent proportional information across these different
formats and some potential avenues through which these
advantages and disadvantages may arise, suggesting new
questions for future work.

Introduction
How we learn and understand the relationship between
numerical symbols (i.e., number words or Arabic numerals)
and the quantities they represent is a critical component of
numerical cognition research. While the acquisition of
symbols representing discrete, countable sets (e.g., 5 ducks)
is well-studied, less is known about the acquisition of
symbols representing proportional information in our
environment, namely, fractions and decimals. The mapping
between symbolic fractions and the underlying quantity they
represent seems to be particularly difficult for both children
and adults (Hurst & Cordes, 2015; Ni & Zhou, 2005),
potentially due to the complicated nature of the symbolic
representation (e.g., bipartite structure of fractions, etc.), as
well as the variety of ways in which proportional
information is spatially depicted (e.g., number lines, pie
charts). In the current study, we investigated how adults
map between symbolic (fractions, decimals) and spatial
(number lines, pie charts) representations of proportional
quantity.
Evidence from infants (e.g., Denison & Xu, 2009;
McCrink & Wynn, 2007), children (e.g., Boyer, Levine, &

disadvantages for relating to decimal and fraction notation.
For example, substantial research suggests that number lines
may be best for representing continuous magnitude as it
aligns with the manner in which we are posited to represent
number – along a mental number line (e.g., Wang & Siegler,
2013). If so, rational number magnitudes presented in
decimal notation may more naturally translate to number
lines than those presented in fraction notation. On the other
hand, pie charts may be better at conveying part-whole
structure, since the “whole” refers to the complete circle
(“whole” may not be as spatially defined in a number line),
highlighting an alignment between fractions and pie charts.
In the current study we address how adults map between
symbolic and spatial representations of proportional
magnitude using a magnitude comparison task (Experiment
1) and a direct translation task (Experiment 2). In particular,
we address the question of rational number magnitude
representation in two ways: (1) the ease of magnitude access
in various forms and (2) the representational flexibility
offered by particular representations.

3.1 cm wide) were made up of four distinct positive integers
(e.g., 2/3 vs. 3/4 would not occur), in order to avoid the use
of denominator or numerator based strategies. On the DvD
trials one decimal value included digits to the thousandth
position (i.e., three digits after the decimal point; e.g., 0.635;
5.5 cm wide) and one decimal value included digits to the
hundredth position (i.e., two digits after the decimal point;
e.g., 0.76; 4cm wide). The longer decimal was larger on half
the trials in order to make length an unreliable strategy. Pie
chart stimuli were white circles (radius=3.4cm) with the
corresponding proportion filled in black (clock-wise). The
number line stimuli were 8 cm lines extending from the end
points of 0 to 1 (labeled under the left and right end points,
respectively) with a location on the line indicated by a 0.7
cm vertical line.
Procedure All participants completed a magnitude
comparison task in which they were shown two values and
asked to choose which was larger as accurately and quickly
as possible. There were 8 set orders of the six blocks and the
order was counterbalanced across participants with an
approximately equal distribution of participants in each
order. Each block contained four unique trials from each
ratio bin shown twice (once with the largest on the right and
once with the largest on the left) in a random order,
resulting in 96 total trials (4 comparisons x 2 shown twice x
2 ratios x 6 blocks).
Each stimulus remained on the screen until the participant
selected an answer by pressing the left or right arrow on the
keyboard corresponding to their response (left or right
quantity, respectively). Between each stimulus presentation
a fixation cross (0.5cm x 0.5cm) was presented in the center
of the screen for 1000ms. Each block started with an
instruction screen and two practice trials with feedback. The
experimenter remained quietly in the room with the
participant throughout the task and answered any questions
about the procedure prior to each block.
Data Analysis Reaction time (RT) was the primary
dependent variable because accuracy was fairly high with
low variability. Only RTs from correct trials and those that
were within 3 standard deviations of the individual’s mean
RT of that trial type were included in analyses. Only data
from those blocks in which the participant scored at or
above chance (4/8 questions correct) were included.
Participants who had missing data based on these criteria
were excluded from all analyses (N=9). At the group level,
average RTs for each cell that were more than 3 standard
deviations away from the group mean were replaced with
the next highest value that was not considered an outlier.
This resulted in 18/1080 data points being replaced (~1.7%).

Experiment 1
Methods
Participants Fifty-four Boston College students (18 to 24
years, M=19.2 years, 39 Female) participated in exchange
for course credit. An additional nine adults were excluded
based on our exclusion criteria (see Data Analysis).
Stimuli The magnitude comparison task stimuli were
fractions, decimals, pie charts, and number lines
representing proportions between 0 and 1. On each trial,
participants were presented with two proportion stimuli:
Fraction vs. Fraction (FvF), Fraction vs. Pie Chart (FvP),
Fraction vs. Number line (FvL), Decimal vs. Decimal
(DvD), Decimal vs. Pie Chart (DvP), and Decimal vs.
Number line (DvL). Each type of trial was presented in a
separate block. The two proportion stimuli presented on
each trial differed by one of two approximate ratios: Small
(approximately 1.125, ranging from 1.08 to 1.14) and Large
(approximately 1.5, ranging from 1.43 to 1.52).
The proportion magnitudes used in the fraction and
decimal trials were approximately matched (e.g., 1/3 would
be converted to 0.33). The magnitudes used in the symbolic
comparisons (FvF and DvD) were identical to the
magnitudes in the symbolic versus non-symbolic
comparisons (FvP, FvL, DvP, and DvL). However, in the
pie chart (FvP and DvP) and number line (FvL and DvL)
blocks, one of the values in each stimulus pair was
represented using a pie chart or number line (respectively)
instead of a symbol. The choice of which stimuli were
represented using a spatial representation was determined so
that the spatial representation conveyed the larger
magnitude on half the trials.
The symbolic fraction comparisons were created so that
on the FvF trials, the two symbolic fractions (4.7 cm high x

access (Hurst & Cordes, 2015). However, there was also a
Symbol X Comparison interaction, F(2,106)=55.8, p<0.001,
partial η2=0.5. Follow up tests indicated that participants
were much faster when comparing two decimals than
comparing a decimal with either a pie chart or a number line
(p’s<0.001). Conversely, comparisons involving two
fractions were slower than those involving a fraction and a
number line (p=0.024) or a fraction and a pie chart (p=0.07,
marginal). Thus, while decimal notation seemed to offer an
advantage over spatial representations (that is, performance
on trials involving two decimals was better than when a
spatial representation was involved), fraction notation
appeared to present a symbolic disadvantage when
processing numerical magnitude. Processing proportional
information in fraction notation may not only be more
difficult than decimal notation, but it may also be more
difficult than processing proportional information via
conventional, analog spatial representations. Given that the
purpose of numerical symbols is to provide a precise way to
communicate numerical magnitudes, it is counter-intuitive
that discrete fraction notation does not provide more precise
magnitude information than analog spatial representations.

There was a main effect of Ratio F(1,53)=161.8, p<0.001,
partial η2=0.75, Ratio X Symbol interaction, p=0.003,
partial η2=0.15, Ratio X Comparison interaction, p<0.001,
partial η2=0.4, and Ratio X Symbol X Comparison
interaction p<0.001, partial η2=0.15. Pair-wise comparisons
investigating whether there were ratio effects (significantly
slower RTs for Small ratio trials than Large ratio trials) in
each block separately, found significant ratio effects in each
of the six blocks (all p’s<0.001). However, comparisons
involving number lines (DvL and FvL) had significantly
larger ratio effects than those involving pie charts (DvP and
FvP; p’s<0.007) and than those involving only symbols
(DvD and FvF; p’s<0.03).
Thus, the existence of ratio effects in our data suggests
that adults did access the approximate magnitudes of
proportional values represented in decimal, fraction, pie
chart, and number line form. However, the size of the ratio
effects varied depending on the representational form. In
particular, those comparisons involving number lines had
the highest ratio effects, above those involving pie charts or
only symbols. This supports the general idea that number
lines are thought to communicate magnitude information
better than other representations (Cramer, Post, & DelMas,
2002; Wang & Siegler, 2013). Since number lines are
continuous, ordered, and approximate, adults may have been
more inclined to use magnitude-based strategies, leading to
those comparisons being more dependent upon the
particular magnitudes (i.e., higher ratio effects).
There was an overall main effect of Symbol,
F(1,53)=158.8, p<0.001, partial η2=0.75, with Fraction
comparisons taking longer than Decimal comparisons. This
finding is consistent with other work suggesting that

Comparison Biases Next, we were interested in whether
these distinct symbolic and spatial formats may give rise to
biases in the representation of proportional information.
That is, did performance differ depending on if the larger
value (i.e., the correct response) was symbolic or spatial?
We conducted a 2 (Spatial: Pie Chart (PC), Number line
(NL)) X 2 (Symbol: Fraction, Decimal) X 2 (Format of
Largest: Spatial, Symbolic) repeated measures ANOVA on
average RT. There was a main effect of Symbol,
F(1,53)=57.1, p<0.001, partial η2=0.5 and a Symbol X
Spatial interaction, F(1,53)=10.0, p=0.003, partial η2=0.16,
showing the same pattern of findings reported earlier.
However, the critical tests were those involving the format
of the largest value. There was a main effect of Format,

588

F(1,53)=29.6, p<0.001, partial η2=0.4, suggesting a bias
toward indicating that the symbol was smaller than the
spatial representation. However, this was was qualified by
two further interactions. A Symbol X Format interaction,
F(1,53)=4.1, p=0.048, partial η2=0.07, indicated that this
bias (faster responses when the symbol was smaller) was
greater when comparisons involved fractions (when fraction
symbol was the largest value: 2934ms vs. when the fraction
was smallest: 2579ms, p<0.001) than when the comparisons
involved decimals (when decimal symbol was largest:
2136ms; vs. when decimal was smallest: 1973ms, p<0.005).
Second, there was a Spatial X Format interaction,
F(1,53)=97.6, p<0.001, partial η2=0.65, which indicated
that this bias only held when comparing a symbol to a pie
chart. That is, participants were quicker to respond when
the pie chart represented the larger value (2097ms) than
when it was smaller (2747ms; p<0.001); but the reverse
pattern was found for number lines, where participants were
quicker to respond when the number line depicted a smaller
value than the symbol (2323ms vs. 2455ms; p=0.028).
Thus, adults may be biased toward thinking that pie charts
are larger than fractions and decimals, but that number lines
are smaller than fractions and decimals. Moreover, given
that the symbol bias was greater for fractions, it may be that
adults have a tendency to think a fraction represents a
smaller value than the equivalent decimal. However,
previous studies that had adults directly compare fractions
and decimals did not find evidence of this pattern (Hurst &
Cordes, 2015). Thus, it may be that these biases only arise
when adults are directly thinking about number lines and pie
charts in relation to the fractions and decimals.
Thus, in Experiment 1, we show that although adults
accessed magnitude information in all comparisons (as
evidenced by ratio effects), number lines in particular may
encourage magnitude-based comparison strategies (as
evidenced by largest ratio effects).
Most notably,
comparisons involving only symbols were privileged (i.e.,
faster) over those involving spatial representations, but only
for comparisons involving decimal notation; that is,
decimals provided a symbolic advantage for conveying
magnitude, but fractions did not. Furthermore, although
participants were asked to compare across formats, it is
unclear how they went about performing these comparisons.
Did they explicitly translate magnitude information across
representations in order to make the comparison? In
Experiment 2, we investigate performance when translating
across representational formats (spatial to symbolic and vice
versa) in order to shed light on the accuracy with which
proportional information is represented in each form.

additional adults participated but were excluded for not
following instructions properly. All participants received
course credit and none participated in Experiment 1.
Stimuli The same pie chart and number line stimuli from
Experiment 1 were used. The fractions and decimal values
were equivalent to the pie chart and number line magnitudes
so that the magnitudes used in all eight blocks were the
same (up to rounding error for decimal magnitudes). All
other aspects of the stimuli were identical to Experiment 1.
In order to input their answer, a text box was provided for
fractions and decimals. When translating to a number line, a
number line (7cm) from 0 to 1 (marked under the left and
right endpoints respectively) was shown and participants
could move a small vertical line (0.5cm) along the line to
select their response. When translating to a pie chart, an
empty circle (radius=3cm) was shown on the screen with a
3cm line extending from the top of the circle to the center.
Another line extended from the center of the circle to the
edge of the circle and moved around the circle
corresponding to the location of the participant’s cursor.
When the participant clicked with the mouse, the pie chart
filled in the portion between the top vertical line and the
participant’s adjustable line black.
Procedure Participants completed a Translation task in
which they were given a quantity represented using either a
fraction, decimal, pie chart, or number line, and asked to
estimate that quantity using a different representation. The
task included eight distinct blocks: Pie to Fraction (PtoF),
Fraction to Pie (FtoP), Line to Fraction (LtoF), Fraction to
Line (FtoL), Pie to Decimal (PtoD), Decimal to Pie (DtoP),
Line to Decimal (LtoD), and Decimal to Line (DtoL). There
were 8 trials per block, making the task 64 trials (8 trials per
block x 8 blocks). The blocks were presented in 8 set orders,
counterbalancing across participants.
Prior to each block, participants were shown an
instruction screen and the experimenter showed them how
to input their response in the correct format. On each trial,
the target value was displayed on the left and the empty
response (text box, empty line, or empty pie chart) was
displayed on the right. Participants could fill in their answer
by clicking in a location (number line and pie chart) or
typing in a response (decimal and fraction). Participants
pressed a button to move on to the next question. The
experimenter remained quietly in the room the entire time.
Data Analysis Mean Absolute Error (MAE), calculated as
the absolute value of the difference between the correct
proportion and the response, was the primary dependent
variable.
Exclusion criteria and outlier treatment was identical to
that of Experiment 1. At the group level, 8/328 data-points
(~2.4% of the data) were considered outliers and replaced
with the next highest non-outlier.

trials involving decimals resulted in lower error than those
involving fractions. There was no main effect of Direction,
however, there was a significant Symbol X Direction
interaction, F(1,40)=6.01, p<0.02, partial η2=0.1. Follow up
t-tests revealed that when translating proportional
information to a NL, performance was equally accurate
regardless of whether the starting value was a fraction or a
decimal (p=0.8). However, when translating proportional
information from a NL, performance was significantly better
when converting into a decimal compared to a fraction
(p=0.023). That is, adults were particularly inaccurate when
converting from a NL into a fraction, a finding that may be
attributed to two factors: (1) the fact that fractions are
particularly inaccurate for representing magnitude
information (Hurst & Cordes, 2015) and (2) a mismatch in
the way magnitude information is represented in fraction
form (part-whole) and in NL form (linear, continuous).

We conducted a 2 (Direction: Symbol to Spatial vs. Spatial
to Symbol) X 2 (Symbol Type: Fraction (F) vs. Decimal
(D)) X 2 (Spatial Type: Pie Chart (PC) vs. Number Line

General Discussion
In this study, we investigated adults’ representation of
proportional magnitudes across common symbolic
(fractions, decimals) and spatial (number lines, pie charts)
formats. In line with the exact precision offered by symbols,
decimal notation provided adults with the greatest level of
precision when comparing magnitudes in Experiment 1 and
when translating between different representations of
magnitude in Experiment 2. Thus, decimals seemed to offer
the symbolic advantage that is expected. In contrast,
fractions did not; comparisons involving exclusively
fraction notation took the longest, even compared to those
involving spatial, non-symbolic representations. These
findings of a symbolic magnitude advantage for decimals
adds to a growing literature (DeWolf et al., 2014; Hurst &
Cordes, 2015) by further suggesting that decimals are also
more accurate than analog spatial representations of
proportion and, conversely that fractions are potentially less
precise at conveying magnitude information than spatial
representations.
In addition, Experiment 2 suggested some advantage for
estimating proportional magnitude using pie charts over
using number lines. Given the literature suggesting that
teaching fractions using number lines is beneficial, this
finding is counterintuitive (e.g., Cramer et al., 2002; Wang
& Siegler, 2014). However, it is important to note that these
adults were not receiving instruction on number lines and
pie charts, and what’s more, in line with instructional
practices in the U.S. over the past 15 years, these adults
likely received a curriculum that relied heavily on pie
charts. Keeping this in mind, there are at least two potential
explanations for these findings. On the one hand, adults may
have attempted to engage in a partitioning strategy (i.e.,
dividing the image into the total number of parts) for both
pie charts and number lines, but executing that strategy may
have been easier with a pie chart. For example, since both
pie charts and number lines were presented continuously
(i.e., un-partitioned), it may be easier to visibly estimate

First, there was a main effect of Symbol Type,
F(1,40)=4.5, p<0.05, partial η2=0.1, revealing adults were
more accurate when translations involved a decimal
(compared to those involving a fraction). This finding aligns
with those of Experiment 1 and previous work (e.g., Hurst
& Cordes, 2015) suggesting that decimals provide more
accurate magnitude information than fractions. There was
also a main effect of Spatial Type, F(1,40)=9.76, p<0.004,
partial η2=0.2, revealing, in contrast to previous research
highlighting the benefits of number lines (Wang & Siegler,
2013), that adults were more accurate when translations
involved a pie chart compared to a NL.
Furthermore, there was a three-way interaction between
Direction, Symbol, and Spatial Type, F(1,40)=5.0, p<0.05,
partial η2=0.1. We investigated this three-way interaction
further by conducting two 2 X 2 repeated measures
ANOVAs, looking at the effect of Direction (2) and Symbol
Type (2) separately for PCs and NLs.
The 2 x 2 ANOVA on data from trials involving PCs
revealed no main effects or interactions (p’s>0.2) suggesting
that performance was very similar regardless of whether the
translation involved a fraction or a decimal or whether the
PC was the target or the initial value.
However, the pattern was not the same when we looked at
the data from trials involving NLs. The 2 x 2 ANOVA on
data from NL trials revealed a main effect of Symbol,
F(1,40)=4.23, p<0.05, partial η2=0.1, again suggesting that

partitions in a pie chart because it is symmetric through the
center of the circle. Thus, the same partitioning strategy may
not be equally accurate across the two representations. On
the other hand, adults may have opted not to engage in
partitioning with number lines but instead invoked an
altogether different strategy when faced with a number line
trial. For example, given its continuous nature, participants
may have attempted to estimate the proportion of the line
that was marked using a magnitude-based strategy. This
hypothesis (that number lines evoke more approximate
strategies than pie charts) is also consistent with the
relatively high ratio effects found in Experiment 1 when
comparing number line magnitudes. Given that fractions are
particularly poor conveyors of magnitude information
(Hurst & Cordes, 2015), this poor strategy selection may
have led to lower response precision particularly when
translating between number lines and fractions. Since
fractions are more aligned to discrete representations (Rapp
et al., 2015), it may be that the approximate strategy evoked
by the number line is particularly difficult to translate into
fraction form. Further research could investigate how these
performance differences arise by investigating specific
strategies invoked for different representations (i.e., pie
charts and number lines) as well as in different tasks.
Although we found that number lines and fractions may be
misaligned in some translation contexts in Experiment 2,
this response penalty (slower RTs) was only found when
translating into a fraction. This finding suggests that adults
in Experiment 1 may not have mentally converted spatial
representations into fractions when comparing across
formats, but instead did the reverse - converting fractions
into spatial representations - to make the comparison.
In conclusion, the current study adds to the growing
literature investigating the advantages and limitations of
proportion representation in various forms. Results suggest
that the mapping between symbolic and spatial
representations of proportion may heavily depend on the
specific symbolic notation involved and on the type of
spatial representation of quantity. Future work should
attempt to isolate how these different mappings are learned
in young children and what impact these distinct
representational formats may have on their understanding of
proportional information.
