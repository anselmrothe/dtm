Abstract
Moral judgment often involves pinning causation for harm to
a particular person. Since it reveals “who one sides with”, expression of moral judgment can be a costly social act that people may be motivated to conceal. Here, we demonstrate that
a simple, well-studied psycholinguistic task (implicit causality) can be leveraged as a novel implicit measure of morally
relevant causal attributions. Participants decided whether to
continue sentences like “Amy killed Bob because...” with either the pronoun he or she. We found that (1) implicit causality selections predicted explicit causal judgments, (2) selecting the object (victim) for harm/force events (e.g., kill, rape)
predicted endorsement of moral values previously linked to
victim-blame, and (3) higher hostile sexism predicted selecting the female as the cause in male-on-female harm/force. The
implicit causality task is a new measure of morally motivated
causal attribution that may circumvent social desirability concerns.

Introduction
Blame and condemnation is often placed on the perceived
cause of a negative outcome (Malle, Guglielmo, & Munroe,
2014; Cushman, 2008). However, while we often talk loosely
about the cause of an event (Hilton, 1990), the truth is far
more complex. For instance, we might say that Brutus slew
Caesar because he despised him. However, Brutus might explain Caesar’s death by referring to a different, prior cause:
“Caesar was ambitious, so I slew him.” In fact, there are many
points along the causal chain that links the Big Bang to Caesar’s death, any of which could conceivably be referenced in
an explanation.
Nonetheless, people tend to focus on certain causes at the
expense of others. For example, people typically focus on
causes that are more proximal to the event, ignoring those that
are more distal (cf. White, 1992; Hilton, McClure, & Sutton,
2010). Both Caesar’s birth and his presence in the Forum on
the Ides of March were causally necessary for the murder,
but there is something unsatisfactory about the explanation
that Brutus slew Caesar because Caesar was born. Furthermore, when perceiving causal events, humans tend to focus
on powers and ignore liabilities (White, 2006, 2007). For example, classic Michottean perception of causation involves
asymmetric attention to power over liability: even though the
“launched” ball could be construed as stopping the other ball,
people reliably perceive a “launching” rather than a “stopping” event (Michotte, 1963; Mayrhofer & Waldmann, 2014;
White, 2006).
Since causal powers are mapped to “agents” and causal liabilities to “patients” (White, 2006), this suggests that peo-

ple will construe causality asymmetrically across the agentpatient dyad during social and moral reasoning. In one sense,
this seems obvious: powers of the “agent” (e.g., the ability to
kill) seem much more likely to be deemed causal than liabilities of the “patient” (i.e., the ability to be killed). Brutus could
not have killed an immortal, but Caesar’s mortality is unlikely
to be considered a candidate explanation (Brutus killed Caesar because Caesar is mortal). However, agents are more
than their physical powers and liabilities; actions are imbued
with social and moral meaning that cannot be boiled down
to physical descriptions. While humans may prefer certain
kinds of explanations and focus on certain kinds of causes,
how the “causal asymmetry” plays out in social-moral domain is far from clear (White, 2006).
People can and do discuss distal causes, patients, and liabilities during evaluation of morally relevant events (Heider
& Simmel, 1944). Thus, understanding human blame assignment and condemnation behavior requires rich theories of
causation (e.g. Gerstenberg, Goodman, Lagnado, & Tenenbaum, 2015; Wolff, 2007). Deepening our understanding of
the representation of causation in moral judgment, in turn, is
crucial for both our theoretical understanding of moral cognition as well as for public policy and organizational planning.
However, the social importance of moral reasoning makes
it difficult to study: subjects may be motivated to give socially desirable answers or conceal their thoughts and attitudes (Alicke, 2000; Banaji & Heiphetz, 2010; Fazio &
Olsen, 2003). Prior work shows that attributions often disfavor people representing social groups that participants view
in an adversarial manner and favor people representing social
groups with whom they are allied (Morgan, Mullen, & Skitka,
2010). Thus, causal attributions can signal people’s specific
personal alliances and hostilities. In public discourse, collaborative settings such as the workplace, as well as adversarial
situations, revealing partiality can be socially detrimental.
A key challenge is to find tasks that implicitly measure
morally relevant judgments in such a way that circumvents
guarding or concealment. There are now multiple wellvalidated implicit measures that track people’s attitudes about
and associations between concepts – most notably the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (Nosek, Banaji, & Greenwald,
2002; Banaji & Heiphetz, 2010; Fazio & Olsen, 2003; Nock
et al., 2010; Nosek et al., 2002). However, so far, there are no
good implicit measures of moral reasoning and blame assignment per se. In this study, we show that a well-understood
phenomenon from psycholinguistics – implicit causality –
presents just such a measure.

Implicit Causality
People have reliable expectations about why some events
happened. Most people expect the sentence
1. John frightened Amy because...
to continue with a reference to the sentence subject, John
(e.g., he was carrying a gun), but
2. John feared Amy because...
to continue with a reference to the sentence object, Amy (e.g.,
she had a bad temper).1
Verbs’ tendencies to lead people to select the subject or the
object are called their “implicit causality biases” on the basis
that they reflect automatic intuitions about the (most important) cause of the event in question (Garvey & Caramazza,
1974; Hartshorne & Snedeker, 2012; Rudolph & Forsterling, 1997; VanBerkum, Koornneef, Ottena, & Nieuwland,
2007).There are many subject-biased verbs like frightened
and object-biased verbs like feared, as well as verbs that produce no reliable trend in either direction (Pickering & Majid,
2007; Rudolph & Forsterling, 1997; Hartshorne & Snedeker,
2012; Ferstl, Garnham, & Manouilidou, 2011). The implicit
causality task used here involves simply asking participants
to decide whether sentences like (1) or (2) continue with the
pronoun he or she (Hartshorne, 2013).
Interest in determining how exactly implicit causality selections map onto causal cognition has produced a large and
contentious literature (Bott & Solstad, 2014; Hartshorne &
Snedeker, 2012; Hartshorne, 2013; Pickering & Majid, 2007;
Brown & Fish, 1983; Rudolph & Forsterling, 1997). This
work – which we return to in the Discussion – has largely
focused on determining what the differences are between
verbs that result in different implicit causality selections (e.g.,
frighten vs. fear). Here, we show that individual variation
in selections provides a window into individuals’ (moral) beliefs, values, and reasoning processes.

Explicit and Implicit Judgments
We compare implicit causality bias and explicit judgments
about the causal responsibility of the participants in the event,
particularly, beliefs indicative of a view that victims of violence “had it coming” and that such events are “victimprecipitated”. While a view that a victim “probably had it
coming” is likely to be perceived as relatively “safe” to endorse explicitly in an anonymous online survey – which is
what we used – these are precisely the sorts of beliefs that
people may be motivated to conceal in a non-anonymous context (e.g., the workplace or other setting in which impartiality
is the social norm; also, adversarial situations).
Here, we compared implicit causality bias to judgments
that the agent (sentential subject) was necessary and sufficient for what happened, and the patient (sentential object)
1 “Implicit causality” has been used to refer to two different phenomena (Hartshorne, 2013). One involves a tendency for verbs to
lead people to refer to the sentence subject or object following the
because conjunction; this is the phenomenon investigated here. The
other involves a tendency for verbs to trigger intuitions about covariation; see Discussion.

allowed, controlled and deserved the outcome. We expected
a preference to select the object (“object-bias”, henceforth)
across events of harm and force to predict explicit beliefs that
agents were less necessary and sufficient, and that patients
were more likely to have allowed, controlled and deserved
the events. If implicit causality selections predict explicit ratings of agents’ and patients’ causal capacities – judgments
closely tied to moral judgment (Alicke, 1992; Alicke, Mandel, Hilton, Gerstenberg, & Lagnado, 2015) – then this provides initial support for the instrument’s utility as an implicit
measure of morally relevant causal attributions.

Beliefs and Values
We expected that participants would be more likely to
demonstrate an object-bias for harm and force verbs when
shifting moral responsibility off the person in the subject position and onto the person in the object position would align
with their personal beliefs and values. In the current research,
we test two case studies of such motivated causal attribution
related to (a) moral values, and (b) sexism.
Our predictions related to moral values align with prior
work showing that binding values – a cluster of highly intercorrelated moral values that censure disloyalty, disobedience to authority, and sexual/spiritual “impurity” (Graham et
al., 2011) robustly predict attributions of responsibility and
blame to victims (Niemi & Young, in press). If implicit
causality biases to objects of events of harm and force are
more likely in people higher in binding values, this represents evidence of convergent validity in support for our claim
that the implicit causality task taps morally motivated causal
attributions.
We also examine the capacity of the implicit causality task
to serve as an implicit measure of people’s hostility toward
a particular social category, using the test case of hostility
toward women. To this end, we manipulated the gender of
the subject and object in the implicit causality prompts (e.g.,
“John” verbed “Mary”; and vice versa), and measured participants’ hostile sexism (Glick & Fiske, 1996). We expected
participants who were higher in hostile sexism, which involves antagonistic attitudes toward women, to be more likely
to select the object as causal in the implicit causality task only
when men were presented as harming women, and not when
women were presented as harming men. That is, implicit
causality selections should reflect a view of violence against
women as more “victim-precipitated” in people high in hostile sexism. Notably, on our account, sexism should only be
correlated with object-bias for verbs of harm and force when
men are in the subject position and women are in the object
position, and not vice versa; whereas binding values should
be correlated with object-bias for verbs of harm and force regardless of gender of subject and object.

Method
459 participants were recruited via Amazon Mechanical
Turk (Mage = 37.25, SDage = 31.39; 207 female, 247 male,
5 selected other or missing). 314 additional individuals failed

1746

attention checks (n = 189); didn’t complete the study or previously took a related study (n = 125), and were excluded
from analyses.

Implicit Causality Task
Participants viewed 24 randomized prompts in the format “[Agent] [verb]ed [Patient] because” and were asked to
“Please select which word you think would follow.” They
were offered the choices “he” or“she” (counterbalanced pronoun order across items).
We varied agent and patient gender between participants,
presenting half of the sample with male agents and female
patients, and vice versa for the other half. Verbs included 12
conveying harm and force (“harm/force verbs” henceforth);
and 12 filler verbs with ranging causal biases (Bott & Solstad, 2014; Hartshorne & Snedeker, 2012). Verbs and the
probability of selecting the object (“object-bias”) are shown
in Table 1.

Measures of Beliefs about Agents and Patients
After completing the implicit causality task, participants
were instructed to “Consider a hypothetical event:” and were
again presented with the 24 events they had seen during the
implicit causality task but this time without the “because”
connective (e.g., “George impressed Julie.”). Each event was
followed by instructions to “Weigh the following possibilities:” and a series of items in the following order:
1. Agent Unnecessary: “Would [patient] have been [verbed]
by someone else?”
2. Agent Sufficient: “Would [agent] [verb] someone else?”
3. Patient Control: “Did [patient] have control over the occurrence of the event?”
4. Patient Allowing: “Did [patient] let the event happen?”
5. Patient Desert: “Could [patient] have deserved the event?”
Participants responded using sliding scales anchored at 0 =
“Definitely No”; 50 = “Unsure”; 100 = “Definitely Yes”. We
created variables capturing “Agent Contribution” by averaging the Agent Unnecessary ratings (reverse-coded) and Agent
Sufficient ratings (Cronbach’s alpha=.78); and “Patient Contribution” by averaging the Patient Control, Patient Allowing,
and Patient Desert ratings (Cronbach’s alpha=.79).

Moral Values Questionnaire
Moral values in the five foundations (caring, fairness, ingroup loyalty, authority, and purity) were assessed using the
30-item Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) (Graham
et al., 2011).“Individualizing values” represent the extent of
endorsement of caring and fairness values. “Binding values”
represent the extent of endorsement of ingroup loyalty, authority and purity values. Participants also provided demographic information including politics, gender and religiosity.

Ambivalent Sexism Inventory
Sexism was assessed with the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) (Glick & Fiske, 1996). The ASI measures extent of
agreement with 22 statements about women and men in society and allows for the calculation of a hostile sexism score and

a benevolent sexism score. Hostile sexism captures antagonistic attitudes toward women and toward women’s pursuit
of equality, whereas benevolent sexism captures traditional
stereotypes about women as requiring protection by men. In
order to directly index adversarial attitudes toward women,
we used the hostile sexism subscore.

Results
Implicit Causality and Beliefs about Agents and Patients
We hypothesized that the implicit causality task provides a
window into beliefs that victims of violence “had it coming” – which people may be motivated to conceal in many
contexts. Regression analysis with Agent and Patient Contribution entered simultaneously confirmed that object-bias in
the implicit causality task was negatively predicted by Agent
Contribution ratings (b = .176, p < .001) and positively
predicted by Patient Contribution ratings (b = .240, p < .001)
for harm/force verbs (Model R2 =.13).2 The fact that perceptions of patients as having the capacity to control, allow
and deserve events of harm and force traded off with perception of agents as necessary and sufficient in the model
(r = .483, p < .001) indicates that the nature of the implicit
causality task, which forces a choice between the agent or
patient, aligns well with causal intuitions. Patient Contribution ratings were relatively low for events of harm and force3 ,
which aligns with intuitive jurisprudence: perpetrators of violence and imposition are typically viewed as more causally
responsible than victims.
In sum, increased beliefs that patients controlled, allowed
and deserved events and decreased beliefs that agents were
necessary and sufficient were associated with increased likelihood of selecting people in the object position (patients)
rather than people in the subject position (agents) as causal
in the implicit causality task for events involving harm and
force (see Fig.1a-b). As an illustrative example, ratings of
the likelihood that patients deserved being killed were higher
for participants who continued the sentence “Bob killed Amy
because” with the pronoun referring to the patient – she
(M = 26.10, SEM = 1.89) rather than the agent – he (M =
19.62, SEM = 1.79).
Implicit Causality and Moral Values Prior work has found
that greater endorsement of binding values – loyalty, respect
for authority and preservation of purity – predicts greater attribution of blame to victims (Niemi & Young, in press).
Accordingly, we expected greater endorsement of binding
values to correlate with object-bias for harm/force verbs in
the implicit causality task. As hypothesized, binding values were correlated with object-bias for harm/force verbs
(r = .294, p < .001), but not filler verbs (r = .07, p = .14). To
illustrate, binding values positively predicted the likelihood
2 Object-bias for filler verbs was positively predicted by Patient
Contribution ratings (b = .169, p < .001), but not Agent Contribution ratings (p = .54).
3 Patient Contribution ratings for harm/force verbs (M =
31.5, SEM = .77) were significantly lower than for filler verbs (M =
55.42, SEM = .62,t(458) = 32.27, p < .001). See Table 1 for means.

Amy because ... he or she?”) showed (a) reduced ratings of agents’
causal contributions, (b) increased ratings of patients’ causal contributions, and (c) higher binding values. Participants who were

Also as hypothesized, correlations between binding values
and object-bias for harm/force verbs were maintained across
gender frames, no matter whether male-verbed-female (r =
.399, p < .001), or female-verbed-male (r = .201, p = .002).4
Individualizing values were uncorrelated with object-bias for

To determine the contribution of binding values above and

Contribution (b = .151, p = .002) significantly predicted
object-bias for the harm/force verbs (Model R2 =.17).

Implicit Causality and Sexism Supporting hypotheses, hostile sexism was correlated with object-bias for harm/force
verbs when male-verbed-female (r = .439, p < .001; Fig.1d,
left panel), but not when female-verbed-male (r = .05, p =
.45; Fig.1d, right panel). To illustrate, higher hostile sexism indicated a higher likelihood of selecting “she” following
“Bob killed Amy because ... he or she?” (OR = 1.94, p <
.001), but had no predictive value for selections following
“Amy killed Bob because ... he or she?” (OR = .927, p <
.54). These results indicate that a view of men’s violence toward women as “victim-precipitated” in people high in hostility toward women is measurable with the implicit causality
task.

Replications
The above study was replicated twice as part of two followup studies. We again found significant correlations between binding values and implicit causality object-bias for
harm/force events [Replication 1: n=788 (r = .137, p < .001);
Replication 2: n=249 (r = .287, p < .001)] and significant
correlations between hostile sexism and implicit causality
object-bias for harm/force events when men were sentence
subjects and women sentence objects [Replication 1, n=410
(r = .375, p < .001); Replication 2, n=121 (r = .459, p <
.001)], but not when women were sentence subjects and men
sentence objects (p0 s > .84).

Discussion
The implicit causality task is a novel measure of motivated
causal attribution. Average object-bias in the task (i.e., likelihood of selecting a pronoun referring to the person in the
object position to follow “X verbed Y because”) positively
correlated with beliefs that patients allowed, controlled, and
deserved harm/force events. Implicit causality object-bias
for harm/force events was also positively correlated with endorsement of binding values, which were previously found
to predict victim blaming (Niemi & Young, in press). Finally,
implicit causality object-bias for harm/force events when men
were sentence subjects and women were sentence objects was
positively correlated with hostile sexism. This demonstrates
that more specific patterns of hostility toward people in particular social categories (here, women) are traceable with the
implicit causality task. We replicated these results twice.
The relationship between implicit causality selections and
ratings of agents’ and patients’ contributions to harm and
force indicates that the implicit causality task has predictive
validity as an index of people’s causal attributions across the
agent-patient dyad. This finding has implications for an influential theory of moral cognition – “dyadic morality” – which
argues that the agent-harms-patient template represents the
core structure of immoral events (Gray, Young, & Waytz,
2012; Schein & Gray, 2015; Gray, Schein, & Ward, 2014).
On this account, a universal feature of moral judgment is a
tendency for people to justify their moral judgments by identifying harmed victims and asymmetrically loading causality and blame onto harmful perpetrators (Gray et al., 2014;
Schein & Gray, 2015). The current results indicate that
there is systematic diversity in how people attribute causation
across the dyad for events that involve harm and force.
Prior work has argued that implicit causality biases do not
reliably predict explicit causal judgments, at the verb-specific
level of analysis (Hartshorne, 2013), based on examining the
relationship between implicit causality selections and people’s ratings of covariation (i.e., ratings of subject as “the kind
of person who verbs people” and the object as the “kind of
person people verb”; Brown & Fish, 1983). In line with this
prior work, we found that participants’ ratings of agents’ sufficiency and necessity, which involved a counterfactual framing of similar items in our study, did not pattern with implicit
causality ratings for individual verbs. The capacity of the
implicit causality task to tap into people’s causal reasoning
about agents and patients was revealed when averaging across
verbs of harm and force. This indicates that the task is particularly well-suited to reveal one’s general construal of the nature of dyadic human action involving harm and imposition,
namely, how much one views harm as sourced in autonomous
agents versus compelled by precipitating patients.
The positive relationship between object-bias in the implicit causality task and binding values aligns with prior findings that binding values predict victim blame via increased
attributions of responsibility to victims (Niemi & Young, in
press). Why might binding values predict attributions to pa-

tients at the implicit and explicit level? Unlike individualizing values which promote unconditional care and straightforwardly define agents’ harm to patients as always wrong, binding values – loyalty, respect for authority, concern for purity –
involve moralization of norms which sometimes require harm
(Graham et al., 2011; Niemi & Young, in press). For example,
loyalty to the ingroup may entail harming people belonging to
the outgroup; harming or banishing a group member who has
brought dishonor on the group may be compatible with moral
valuation of purity (e.g., honor killing). Thus, people who
highly endorse binding values may deviate from the typical
pattern of moral judgment focused on events fitting an agentharms-patient template (Gray et al., 2012; Schein & Gray,
2015). Indeed, aligning with the prior work focused on moral
judgment (Niemi & Young, in press), here we found that people higher in binding values were those more likely to show
an “inverted” pattern of attribution for events of harm and
force whereby patients were selected as causal over agents.
We also found evidence that the implicit causality task
tracks more specific motivated attributions. Hostile sexism
was correlated with object-bias for events of harm and force
when women were in the object position (and men in the
subject position), but not when men were in the object position (and women in the subject position). This result indicates that hostility toward a specific social category (here,
women) meaningfully predicts implicit attributions of causality across events of harm and force to representatives of that
social category in the position of “harmed-patient” – in addition to broader moral commitments (i.e., binding values). Future work will investigate the influence of manipulations of
the implied race of the sentence subject and object together
with individual differences in racism on implicit causality for
events of harm and force. Other work will explore the extent
to which viewing agent-patient events as induced by patients
serves post hoc justification of moral condemnation or exculpation of agents with whom one feels at risk of being identified (Heider, 1958; Morgan et al., 2010) by experimentally
manipulating group membership (e.g., Masten et al., 2010).
Prior work has demonstrated that implicit measures can tap
into people’s hidden biases (Fazio & Olsen, 2003). The IAT,
for example, is a powerful implicit instrument because even
if participants infer the experimenter’s aim to measure negative attitudes toward a target and attempt to alter their task
behavior, they are not likely to be successful. Nevertheless,
researchers may be interested in measuring attitudes toward a
target more covertly. One advantage of the implicit causality
task is that it can be embedded with distractor items, potentially disguising experimenters’ aims. And since individual
items are answered very quickly, demand characteristics and
participant bias can be kept low in this manner without making the task excessively long. Moreover, the ease of administrating the implicit causality task will make it simple to combine with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
electroencephalography (EEG), and other measures of neural
activity in future investigations of the neurobiological mecha-

1749

nisms involved in social judgment and causal attribution. The
implicit causality task can also be completed with a pencil
and paper, or administered verbally. Thus, it has the capacity to tap attitudes via causal attributions in a broad range of
populations, including people unfamiliar with or physically
incapable of using technological devices, and people who are
not literate, including young children. Cross-linguistic investigations with the implicit causality task are also suitable (cf.
Hartshorne, Sudo, & Uruwashi, 2013), which will enable researchers to shed light on cultural differences in motivated
causal attribution. Ongoing work is now focused on characterizing the extent of the implicitness of the implicit causality task, involving, in part, manipulating task instructions and
probing participants’ thoughts on the purpose of the task.

Conclusion
We have shown that responses to the implicit causality task
predict people’s general beliefs about agents’ and patients’
causal contributions to events involving violence and imposition, as well as their higher-level moral values and social
attitudes. The implicit causality task provides a versatile tool
for future research into motivated causal attribution.
