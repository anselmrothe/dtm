letter placements through design from zeroth principles.
Methods
Experiment 3 constructed a transmission chain where partic-
ipants passed along typeset words. The chain was seeded
with randomly spaced words.
Participants. We recruited 200 participants on Amazon
Mechanical Turk.
Stimulus. Fifteen words set in Helvetica were used for the
experiments: Typical, frogs, vacuum, hunchback, Chicago,
Year, Egypt, the, eye, kiln, milk, WAVE, fjord, Bring, and
Pile. These words were chosen because each has at least one
pair of adjacent letters that benefit from kerning (e.g. the W
and A in WAVE). The position of the final letter was deter-
mined by its position when set in Helvetica (Linotype,
v10.0d4e1) at 100 points. In the randomly spaced words
used to seed the chain, each letter’s position was chosen uni-
