Random walks
This geometric framework lends it self to both discrete-
time and continuous-time as well as discrete-space and
continuous-space random walk representations. A discrete-
space structure can be given to the models I have described
so far by imposing a lattice structure upon them.
   For example, suppose we are interested in using an equal
relative evidence diffusion model to describe how a person
sorts a color stimulus into three categories: red, blue, or
green. This corresponds to the triangular structure shown in
Figure 1B. In order to produce a discrete random walk in this
space, one can construct a triangular lattice bounded by the         Figure 2: Lattice and state transition structure for a 3-

   In this case, a person’s internal representation of the stim-

ample, if a person is trying to reproduce the orientation of
a stimulus that can vary anywhere from 0 to π radians, they
must be able to sample and represent information that favors
any direction between 0 and π radians. This will often mean
that discrete-state Markov chain representations of the evi-
dence accumulation process are no longer possible, except as
approximations or in the rare case that the choice alternatives
are arranged in a psychological space so that their orientations
allow for a convenient lattice to be superposed upon them.
Random walks in psychological space
Instead of the discrete-state Markov chain, evidence accumu-
lation in a psychological space is enabled by utilizing a multi-
dimensional random walk. In this framework, a person’s cog-
nitive state representing evidence they have gathered from a
stimulus is described by a point in a multidimensional (e.g.
feature-based) space. As a person integrates a new piece in-
formation, this state representation is updated by drawing a
random variable φ that describes a direction in the space and
moving one unit of distance in that direction.
   The distribution of φ is determined by the stimulus and the       Figure 3: State representation, sampling, threshold, and evi-
