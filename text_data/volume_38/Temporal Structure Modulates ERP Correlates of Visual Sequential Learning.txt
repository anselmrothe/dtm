Recording Technique
The electroencephalograph (EEG) was measured from 256
scalp sensors using an Electrical Geodesic Inc. (EGI) EEG
net (Figure 2). Net Station Version 4.3.1 tools were used to
process the EEGs. Active electrode impedances were kept
below 50 kΩ. Recordings were made with a 0.1 to 30 Hz
bandpass filter and digitized at 250 Hz. The EEG was
segmented into epochs -200 to +1000ms with respect to the
predictor onset. An artifact detection operation removed
trials containing noise from eye blinks and other
movements. Separate ERPs were computed for each
participant, experimental condition, electrode and block. All
experimental sessions were conducted in a 132 square foot
double-walled, sound-deadened acoustic chamber.
