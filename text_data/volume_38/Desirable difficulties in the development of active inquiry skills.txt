Abstract
This study explores developmental changes in the ability to
ask informative questions. We hypothesized an intrinsic link
between the ability to update beliefs in light of evidence and
the ability to ask informative questions. Four- to ten-year-old
children played an iPad game asking them to identify a hidden
bug. Learners could either ask about individual bugs, or make
a series of feature queries (e.g., “Does the hidden bug have
antenna?”) that could more efficiently narrow the hypothesis
space. Critically the task display either helped children integrate evidence with the hypothesis space or required them to
perform this operation themselves. Although we found that
helping children update their beliefs improved some aspects of
their active inquiry behavior, children required to update their
own beliefs asked questions that were more context-sensitive
and thus informative. The results show how making a task
more difficult may actually improve children’s active inquiry
skills, thus illustrating a type of desirable difficulty.

Introduction
A central aim of science education is to teach students how to
approach the task of understanding their environment. Rather
than teaching only a catalogue of facts about the biological
and physical worlds, current standards emphasize teaching
the conceptual and analytic skills that underlie science: detecting patterns in environments that initially appear chaotic,
abstracting the general principles that can be used to understand and predict events, and importantly, learning how to ask
informative questions to reveal these patterns and principles
when they are not immediately obvious (Bransford, Brown, &
Cocking, 2000; Donovan & Bransford, 2005; Duschl, Schweingruber, & Shouse, 2007).
Many of the cognitive skills required for active scientific
inquiry follow protracted developmental trajectories. For example, in tasks designed to assess scientific reasoning abilities, children in the older elementary school years (ages 810) often have difficulty adopting systematic strategies, such
as testing the effects of one variable at a time or selecting
interventions that will lead to determinate evidence (Chen
& Klahr, 1999). Although children in the older elementary
school years can be taught to engage in these strategies via direct instruction (Klahr & Nigam, 2004; Kuhn & Dean, 2005),
it is notable how difficult it is for them to discover and implement them on their own.
One reason for the difficulties children show may be that
active inquiry depends on the coordination of a variety of
component cognitive processes (belief updating, decision
making, hypothesis generation, etc.). Inefficiencies in any
or all of these interrelated processes may serve as developmental limitations. For example, young learners may be able

to search efficiently for information given a particular set of
hypotheses but have trouble updating their beliefs correctly
given new evidence. In this sense active inquiry is like a
bicycle: when all the elements are properly functioning and
aligned the bike moves forward. However, misalignment of
any one component can be catastrophic.
The present study joins with some recent work which attempts to decompose the component processes involved in active inquiry (e.g., Bonawitz & Griffiths, 2010). In particular,
we tasked four to ten-year olds to identify a hidden bug in a
simple iPad variant of the classic “Guess Who?” game. Children asked questions to try to identify the hidden bug. Across
conditions, we manipulated whether the computer program
helped children to use the new evidence that resulted from
their queries to narrow down the hypothesis space, or whether
children had to use the new evidence to update the hypothesis
space on their own. Our expectation was that helping children to update their beliefs accurately following the receipt of
new information would free up cognitive resources and lead
to more effective question-asking. Interestingly, our results
opposed our main hypothesis in that elements which ostensibly made our task more difficult actually improved the quality
of children’s inquiry behavior.

How the ability to ask revealing questions develops
Experimental tasks based on the “Guess Who?” game have
often been used to study question asking and active inquiry
with both children and adults. In the game, the asker (participant) tries to determine a hidden object known only to the
the answerer (experimenter) (e.g., “What animal am I thinking of?”) by asking a series of yes-or-no questions. Mosher
and Hornsby (1966) identified two broad question types commonly used in the game: hypothesis- scanning questions
test a single hypothesis (e.g., “Is it a monkey?”), whereas
constraint-seeking questions attempt to constrain the hypothesis space faster by querying features that are present or absent in multiple objects (e.g., “Is it soft?”), but that do not
directly identify the answer except by virtue of elimination.
A classic finding in this literature is that younger children
(e.g., aged 6) tend to ask more hypothesis-scanning questions,
while older children (e.g., aged 11) use more constraintseeking questions, and also tend to find the answer after
fewer questions (Mosher & Hornsby, 1966). One explanation is that only older children have developed the ability
to focus on the high-level features that group the hypotheses, whereas younger children focus on individual stimuli.
Consistent with this viewpoint, manipulations that help children focus on these higher-level features (such as cuing them

2477

with basic level category labels instead of exemplar names
(Ruggeri & Feufel, 2015) increase the likelihood that young
children will generate constraint-seeking questions (see also
Herwig (1982). Further, although young children are often
relatively less likely than older children to ask constraintseeking questions, even younger children (ages 7-9) are more
likely to do so when such questions are particularly informative, such as when the hypothesis space is large and there
several equally probable solutions remaining (e.g., Ruggeri &
Lombrozo, 2015; 2015).
Whereas previous work has focused on developmental
changes in when children generate informative, hypothesisscanning questions, less prior work has considered possible
developmental changes in how children make use of the new
evidence that their questions reveal. As described above, effective active inquiry involves the coordination of multiple
cognitive processes–representing the hypothesis space, generating an informative query, updating one’s representation
of the hypothesis space in light of the data produced by the
query, and so on. As suggested by prior work, hypothesis scanning questions might be easier for young children to
generate because they do not require abstracting informative
higher level features (features to query that group classes of
hypotheses together and might allow them to be eliminated
at once). Yet, another reason why hypothesis scanning questions might be easier for young children is that they produce
evidence that is easier for them to process. As a hypothesis scanning question is answered, children are told directly
whether the item they queried is correct or not. If instead children ask about a feature (as in a constraint-seeking question),
additional cognitive processing is required–children have to
take that new information (e.g., that a hidden animal has antennae) and consider each remaining possible exemplar in
light of this information (e.g., check if each one has the antennae) and eliminate from the hypothesis space any that are
ruled out by the new information. This process could be cognitively taxing, and also prone to errors. Thus, although constraint seeking questions are often more informative in theory,
they might not always be so to young children, particularly if
children have difficulty using the obtained information to update their representation of the hypothesis space accurately.
To address these issues, in the present study we manipulated
whether children received assistance in updating their hypothesis space or had to undertake this process on their own, following the receipt of new evidence obtained by their queries.

Experiment
Methods
Participants Participants in this experiment were 134 children between the ages of 5 and 10 years old who were recruited at the American Museum of Natural History’s Discovery Room. Of the 134 children recruited, we analyze the
data from 121 children (21 5-year-olds, 20 6-year-olds, 22
7-year-olds, 20 8-year-olds, 20 9-year-olds, and 18 10-yearolds) who completed 5 or more rounds of the game.

Stimuli On each round, sixteen bugs with the same body
shape but with varying features were used as stimuli. Bugs
were defined by the presence or absence of 9 features: green
body, orange eyes, antennae, big spots, tiny spots, legs,
leaves, water droplets, and blue “fur”. Figure 1 shows an
example of two of the body shapes used, each with all of
the binary features present. One of the sixteen possible bugs
was chosen as the “hidden bug” on each trial which children attempted to identify by asking questions. The hidden
bug was randomly selected on each round, and each round
had differently-shaped bug bodies, selected from a pool of 16
unique body shapes. The bug task was used to fit thematically
with the content of the AMNH Discovery Room activities.

Figure 1: Examples of two bug types with all 9 of the binary features
present. Each round used one of the 16 body shapes.

Design Across the sixteen items, some feature were more
frequent than others (relevant to eight of the possible bugs),
while some were very infrequent (relevant to only 1 bug),
with an abstract structure shown in Figure 2. This introduced
strong differences in the informational utility of each feature.
For example, given no other information it would be informative to ask about feature F1 because is it shared with half
the possible bugs. In contrast, feature F9 is less informative
on the first trial because most of the bugs do no have this
feature. The abstract features in Figure 2 were randomly
assigned to the visual features for each participant, and then
remained consistent across rounds. This gave participants the
opportunity to learn the structure across rounds, for example
to perhaps figure out which visual features are most relevant
to ask about first.
Each of these features was represented on a button, available for participants to query. Before participants were allowed to begin, the experimenter explained at least three of
these buttons, randomly selected. An additional feature button depicted a particular body shape that was not relevant to
the bugs on display. Instead of choosing a feature button,
participants could at any time query an exemplar to determine if it was the hidden bug or not. This paradigm thus enabled us to investigate both the qualitative strategies used by
participants (constraint-seeking feature queries or hypothesisscanning exemplar queries) and to quantify how efficiently
participants searched the hypothesis space, within and across
rounds as they learn a novel structured stimulus space. Moreover, we introduced a novel manipulation: after making a feature query, participants in the manual-update condition had
to select the hypotheses that were consistent with the feed-

done selecting bugs did the experimenter press the “Eliminate” button, which eliminated any bugs that were not selected. Although manual-update participants received training for the manual elimination in the dog house training task,
as well as gentle reminders in the first round of the bug game,
it should be noted that it was possible for mistakes to be made
during manual updating–unlike in the automatic condition.

back, whereas participants in the automatic-update condition
had the hypothesis space automatically updated. This manipulated the ease of updating the hypothesis space: a difficult step in the cycle of active inquiry that has not been wellstudied.
Procedure After being trained by an experimenter on a
simpler version of the task with unrelated stimuli (a dog
searching dog houses), participants played 5 or more rounds
of an iPad game asking them to identify which one of 16 bugs
is hidden under a rug (see Figure 3). The task alternated between the query phase and the elimination phase. In the query
phase, players either queried individual bugs, or used feature
queries (e.g., “Is the hidden bug green?”) to find out whether
the hidden bug had a particular feature. If a single exemplar
was queried by tapping on it, feedback was immediate: if it
happened to be the hidden bug, a smiley face appears and the
round was done, whereas if the tapped exemplar was not the
hidden bug, a red “X” appeared on top of the tapped bug and
the bug becomes grayed out (i.e., eliminated). After a feature
query, the bug gave feedback, saying “Yes!” (it has the feature; narrated by the experimenter), or “No!” (it does not have
the feature). This was followed by the elimination phase, during which bugs that are inconsistent with the feedback were
eliminated, thus narrowing the hypothesis space.
Participants were assigned in counterbalanced order to one
of two hypothesis-updating conditions. In the automaticupdate condition, after the feedback from a feature query,
subjects merely pressed the “Eliminate” button and all the
irrelevant bugs are eliminated (grayed out), and the game returns to the guessing phase. In the manual-update condition,
after a subject made a feature query and saw feedback, they
had to select each bug that was consistent with the feedback
for that feature, as shown in the top right of Figure 3. Bugs
were selected (denoted by a green box) by tapping, and could

asking if the bug hidden under the rug is green. Given feedback
(“Yes!”), participants in the manual update condition select the bugs
that are consistent with this new information (upper right), whereas
in the automatic condition the consistent bugs are selected by the
game. Players in both conditions press the red button to return to
the button phase, and again either choose a feature button or query a
single bug.

Results
Overall We analyzed the first 10 rounds from each child
(only 8 children played more than 10 rounds, including one
who played 51 rounds). This covers 722 rounds from 121
children. The mean number of total queries (feature and exemplar) taken to complete a round was 6.5 in the automaticupdate condition, and 7.6 in the manual-update condition.
Although the median queries to complete a round in each
condition was 6, the distributions were significantly different
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D = 0.13, p < .01). For comparison, we simulated 700 rounds of the game with an agent that
clicked randomly in the task. This agent took on average 8.9
queries (median: 9) to complete a round.
Response Times Participants’ median RT for each button
type (feature and exemplar) was computed and these data
were subjected to an ANOVA with condition (automatic,
manual) and age group (5-7, 8-10) as between-subjects factors and button type as a within-subject factor. There were
significant main effects of button type (F(1,229) = 42.52,
p < .001) and condition (F(1,229) = 4.14, p < .05), but not a
significant main effect of age group (F(1,229) = 0.73). On av-

erage, participants took longer to make queries in the manual
condition (4800 ms) than in the automatic condition (4000
ms). Overall, participants took much longer to make feature queries (7,470 ms) than to press an exemplar button
(2,680 ms), perhaps indicating more thought before making
more complex queries. There was also a significant interaction effect of button type and condition (F(1,229) = 12.89,
p < .001). Figure 4 shows the mean of subjects’ median RTs
for each button type, split by condition. Feature queries were
slower in the manual-update condition (7900 ms vs. 5430 ms
in automatic), which could indicate 1) more careful thought
given to features in this condition, and/or 2) general hesitance
to use feature queries, perhaps because it is time-consuming
(even difficult) to manually update hypotheses. Exemplar
queries were faster in the manual-update condition (1850 ms
vs. automatic: 2570 ms), which could be greater readiness to
use the simpler strategy.

other interactions were significant (all Fs < 1).
Figure 5 shows the average number of query types used
per round for participants by age group. Both age groups
in the manual-update condition used more exemplar queries
than feature queries. In comparison to the manual condition,
there were fewer exemplar queries in the automatic condition (Mman = 5.0, Mauto = 3.2, t(103.5) = 4.1, p < .001),
while there were more feature queries in the automatic condition (Mauto = 3.8) (Mman = 3.3, t(102.9) = 2.1, p < .05).
These query rates were all lower than the simulated random
rounds’ mean number of feature queries (6.5) and exemplar
queries (5.3), but above the optimal.1 Older participants used
a greater proportion of feature queries than younger participants in both the automatic (M5−7 = .50 vs. M8−10 = .66,
t(57.2) = 3.12, p < .01) and manual conditions (M5−7 = .39
vs. M8−10 = .50, t(50.3) = 2.30, p < .05). Thus, both conditions replicate the Mosher and Hornsby (1966) finding that
older children use a greater proportion of constraint-seeking
questions.

Querying Behavior Participants’ mean number of queries
per round were subjected to an ANOVA with condition and
age group (5-7 vs. 8-10) as between-subjects factors and
query type as a within-subject factor. This analysis indicated
significant main effects of condition (F(1,229) = 4.60, p <
.05) and age group (F(1,229) = 12.20, p < .001), and no significant main effect of query type (F(1,229) = 0.10, p = .75).
Overall, older children required fewer total queries to complete a round (M5−7 = 4.2, M8−10 = 3.3), also evidenced by
a significant negative correlation with age (t(119) = 3.24,
p = .001, r = −.28). There were significant interactions of
condition and query type (F(1,229) = 22.18, p < .001), and
age group and query type (F(1,229) = 12.25, p < .001). No

In summary, it is clear that the manual-update condition results in fewer feature queries and more reliance on exemplar
queries. Manual-update participants may be loathe to use feature queries for at least two reasons: 1) it demands more time
and cognitive effort to manually update the hypothesis space
after a feature query than in the automatic-update condition,
and 2) the manual update process is error-prone, and any mistakes may in turn lead to more exemplar queries in order to
recover.2 Therefore we proceed to investigate errors in man1 Although there were at first more exemplars (16) than feature
buttons (10), after the first 1-2 clicks there would likely be few exemplars remaining, thus the expected number of exemplar queries is
lower than the expected number of feature queries in the simulation.

on the grayed-out bugs were needed to find it and finish the round.

ual updating, as well as information theoretic analyses that
will indicate whether the quality of feature queries varied in
the two update conditions. Although the qualitative analyses have thus far revealed interesting effects that build on the
previous literature, as the game unfolds the utility of different
query types (and specific queries) changes, and can be best
quantified using a more sophisticated model-based approach
to understanding the quality of children’s question asking.

I(X;Y ) = H(X) − H(X|Y )

Manual Update Mistakes The manual-update condition
allows participants to commit two types of error during hypothesis updating: a miss is defined as a failure to eliminate
a bug, and a false alarm is a failure to keep a hypothesis that
was consistent with the query. Note that a miss is an error
of commission–i.e., the bug had to be tapped to be kept–
whereas a false alarm is an error of omission (i.e., failing
to tap a bug), and thus we expect more of the latter. Comparing the manual-update subjects’ mean number of errors
of each type per round, indeed there were more false alarms
(M = 6.9, sd = 1.9) than misses (M = 1.8, sd = 1.3; paired
t(58) = 19.8, p < .001). A MANCOVA to determine if error
rates were related to age did not find a significant effect for either misses (F(1,56) = 0.77, p > .05) or false alarms (F(1,56)
= 0.23, p > .05). Given the fairly high rate of errors in manual
updating, it is perhaps unsurprising that fewer feature queries
and more exemplar queries were made in this condition than
under automatic updating of the hypothesis space. However,
RT analyses indicated that feature queries took longer under
manual updating: is this just reluctance, or could it be that
feature queries were more carefully considered in this condition than under the ease of automatic updating? The expected information gain of children’s feature queries provides
a measure of their sensitivity to the information structure in
the stimuli.
Expected Information Gain Each successive query reduces the size of the remaining hypothesis space to some degree: on the first move, querying the appropriate feature (F1)
can cut the space in half. When two hypotheses remain, even
an exemplar query will cut the space in half. The appropriate
way to analyze the contextual sensitivity (i.e., are they choosing a feature that is present for half of the remaining exemplars, thus quickly reducing the hypothesis space?) of participants’ queries is to calculate the Expected Information Gain
(EIG) of the query they made. We first introduce key terms
used to define EIG. Entropy measures uncertainty about the
outcome of a random variable X. Entropy is 0 when there is
only one possible outcome, and maximal when all possible
outcomes are equiprobable (i.e., a uniform distribution).
H(X) = − ∑ p(x) · log(p(x))

(1)

x

Mutual information gain measures the change in entropy
as we receive a new piece of information Y , i.e., how much
does our uncertainty about X change given that we know Y?
This occurred rarely, happening in < 10% of rounds.

(2)

The Expected Information Gain (EIG) of a query Q is the
weighted average of the information possible from each possible answer to the query, weighted by the current probability of receiving that answer. This will be 0 (or near-0) for
queries that can be expected to eliminate none or just one or
two hypotheses in a large space, and more positive for queries
that are likely to eliminate a larger number of hypotheses. In
this task, EIG is maximal (1) for a feature query that will
eliminate half the remaining hypotheses. Such a query is always available at the beginning of any round, and due to the
partially-nested feature structure used, maximal EIG queries
are often available at other stages of the round.
EIG(Q) = − ∑ p(Y |Q)I(X;Y )

(3)

Y

EIG has often been proposed as a model of how children
might evaluate the quality of possible queries. For example, Nelson, Divjak, Gudmundsdottir, Martignon, and Meder
(2014) found that 8-10 year-old children can search a familiar structured domain (people with varying gender, hair color,
etc.) fairly efficiently, tending to ask about frequent realworld features that roughly bisected the search space. Likewise, Ruggeri, Lombrozo, Griffiths, and Xu (2015) found evidence that children’s patterns of search decisions were wellexplained in terms of EIG.
In our study, the EIG for each participants’ feature queries3
were computed, and their mean EIG was subjected to an
ANOVA with condition and age group (5-7 vs. 8-10) as
between-subjects factors. This ANOVA indicated significant
main effects of condition (F(1,115) = 55.0, p < .001) and age
group (F(1,115) = 12.42, p < .001), with no significant interaction effect (F(1,115) = 0.2, p > .05).4 Figure 6 shows
mean EIG per feature query by age group and condition.
Mean EIG of feature queries for each subject was marginally
correlated with age (t(116) = 1.77, p = .08, r = .16), suggesting that older children tended to use more relevant feature queries. The feature queries made by participants in the
automatic condition had significantly lower EIG than those
made in the manual condition (Mauto = .60, Mman = .74,
t(116) = 5.49, p < .001). Thus, although manual-update
participants used fewer feature queries overall, and tended
to make mistakes during hypothesis updating, the greater
amount of time they spent when choosing a feature query
tended to pay off: manual-update participants queried features with higher expected information gain than automatic3 Exemplar query EIGs are less interesting, as they are a simple
function of how many remaining hypotheses there are. Participants’
choice of feature query, on the other hand, indicates how sensitive
they are to the relevance of each feature–and to the context of their
current situation, as it is based on the remaining bugs’ features.
4 The same significant effects and similar mean EIG values were
obtained when analyzing only the first two feature queries per round,
when manual- and automatic-update participants were on more
equal footing (i.e., before further manual errors–which could raise
or lower the EIG of the remaining feature queries).

of which feature query to use, and ultimately a better choice.
Indeed, response times for feature queries were slower under manual updating, perhaps indicating that greater thought
went into making those choices. Indeed, slower feature query
RTs were correlated with higher EIG. In both conditions,
older children made more informative feature queries, but
even 5-7 year-olds asked far more informative questions than
a simulation that chose a random sequence of queries, showing some efficiency in navigating an unfamiliar domain even
after only a few minutes of experience.
In summary, this study provides evidence that hypothesis
updating is a difficult, error-prone step in the active inquiry
process. Moreover, children are sensitive to the difficulty of
this step: if aided in hypothesis updating, they will ask more
constraint-seeking questions than if they must manually update the space. However, we also uncovered evidence of a desirable difficulty in this step, for manual updating resulted in
more informative, context-sensitive constraint-seeking questions than the supported update process. Future work will aim
to reduce errors in hypothesis updating and discover other
bottlenecks–or desirable difficulties–in active inquiry.

update participants. Indeed, there was a weak but significant
correlation of participants’ mean feature query RT and EIG
(r = .20, t(116) = 2.17, p < .05), verifying that longer RTs
are associated with more informative feature queries.

General Discussion
The present study asked children 5-10 years of age to learn
feature distributions in an unfamiliar hypothesis space, and
examined both their qualitative questioning strategies, and
how efficiently they were able to search that space. Importantly, we manipulated the support children were given while
updating the hypothesis space: after a feature query, participants in the automatic update condition were shown which
bugs were eliminated at the press of a button, whereas manual update participants were required to select the bugs that
were consistent with the feedback.
In line with previous research (Mosher & Hornsby, 1966;
Ruggeri & Lombrozo, 2014), older children (ages 8-10)
asked a higher proportion of constraint-seeking questions
than younger children (ages 5-7), who relied more on
hypothesis-scanning (i.e., exemplar queries), in both conditions. These qualitative analyses also found that children use
more constraint-seeking questions (i.e., feature queries) in the
automatic-update condition. On the surface then, these children were using a more efficient strategy than the manualupdate children.
However, in terms of expected information gain, a contextsensitive measure of how well a chosen feature bisects the
remaining hypothesis space, it turned out that children in
the automatic-update condition made less informative feature
queries. We suggest that the greater mental effort required by
manual updating actually lead to more careful consideration
