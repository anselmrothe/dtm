   Resource scarcity poses challenging demands on the human
   cognitive system. Budgeting with limited resources induces an       explanation of these impairments is that scarcity presents
   attentional focus on the problem at hand. This focus enhances       urgent demands that hijack attentional resources, causing a
   processing of relevant information, but it also comes with a        strong focus on the present task. Such focus can induce a
   cost. Specifically, scarcity may cause a failure to notice          neglect of other potentially important information.

the processing of price information, at the cost of other useful
information. Given the attentional prioritization of prices, we
predict that memory encoding of prices will also be
enhanced. This prediction is supported by the recent work            Figure 7. The absolute error in the price recall and the calorie recall
