                         Experiment 3
Experiment 3 was a version of Experiment 2 with two main
modifications: first, the addressee was no longer a
confederate who acted as a passive listener but was
introduced as a ‘naïve’ listener who was actively involved
in the task; second, the task had a specific communicative
purpose (guessing game). We reasoned that in a highly
interactive paradigm, in which participants interacted with a
‘real’ addressee, children’s ability to take into account the
needs of their interlocutor might be more likely to arise.
