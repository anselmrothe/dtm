another. The sequence in which the three boxes lit up
varied, and each box lit up once in the sequence (i.e. “left
box–right box–middle box). Event A required a three key-
press response using the index, middle and ring fingers of
the right hand. Finger mappings for this response were
always spatially compatible where the first box
corresponded to the index finger, the middle box
corresponded to the middle finger, and the last box
corresponded to the ring finger. Participants planned and
maintained an action for Event A in the reverse order in
which the Event A stimuli appeared. For example, if the
light stimulus appeared first in the right box, then in the
middle box, followed by the left box, then the participant
planned to press the key corresponding to the left box first
(index finger), then the middle box (middle finger),
followed by the right box (ring finger).1

with the within-subjects factors of feature overlap (first,
second, or third) and finger (index, middle, or ring) was
conducted separately on the correct RTs for Action B,
percentage of errors for Action B, and the percentage of
errors for Action A. Analysis of mean RTs for Action B was
restricted to trials in which Action B and Action A were
both executed accurately. Analysis of Action B error rate
was restricted to trials in which Action A was executed
accurately. All comparisons between means were conducted
using Bonferroni Pairwise Comparisons (p<.05). Figure 2
shows the mean correct RTs and correct error rates for
Action B. As is evident in the figure, RTs based on feature
overlap varied, and this RT pattern differed depending on
which finger was used to respond.
