these causal influences can be incorporated into the models.
   In this study, we investigate the causal relations between
measures describing CL (i.e., number of words produced, lex-
ical diversity, and mean length of utterances) and the equiv-
alent measures in CDL, using the longitudinal data provided
in the Manchester Corpus (Theakston, Lieven, Pine, & Row-
land, 2001). In order to detect causal relations between the
different measures, we make use of state space reconstruc-

causal relations in dynamical systems (Multispatial Conver-
