Abstract
Infants, children and adults are capable of implicitly
extracting regularities from their environment through
statistical learning (SL). SL is present from early infancy and
found across tasks and modalities, raising questions about the
domain generality of SL. However, little is known about its’
developmental trajectory: Is SL fully developed capacity in
infancy, or does it improve with age, like other cognitive
skills? While SL is well established in infants and adults, only
few studies have looked at SL across development with
conflicting results: some find age-related improvements while
others do not. Importantly, despite its postulated role in
language learning, no study has examined the developmental
trajectory of auditory SL throughout childhood. Here, we
conduct a large-scale study of children's auditory SL across a
wide age-range (5-12y, N=115). Results show that auditory
SL does not change much across development. We discuss
implications for modality-based differences in SL and for its
role in language acquisition.
Keywords: statistical learning; developmental differences

Introduction
One of the deepest questions in cognitive science is how
children learn about the structure of their environment. A
fruitful line of work on this question examines the ability to
extract knowledge about the world via statistical learning.
Statistical learning (SL) refers to the ability to implicitly
detect recurring patterns in sensory input based on statistical
properties, and use them to learn higher order structure, like
that found in language (Romberg & Saffran, 2010; Thiessen
& Erickson, 2015). The term "SL" was originally coined in
a speech segmentation study showing 8-month-old infants
can use transitional probabilities between syllables as a cue
to word boundaries (Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996).
In the past two decades, numerous studies have shown
that SL is present from very early infancy (Bulf, Johnson, &
Valenza, 2011, Kuhl, 2004), in a variety of modalities
(auditory, visual and tactile, see Conway & Christiansen,
2005), and can facilitate learning across a range of linguistic
domains (Saffran, 2003) – from phonemic inventory (Maye,
Werker, & Gerken, 2002), through word order preferences
(Gervain, Nespor, Mazuka, Horie, & Mehler, 2008), to
syntax (Gomez & Gerken, 1999). This body of literature
illustrates learners' ability to extract structure by attending to
distributional regularities in their environment.
However, while SL has been studied extensively with
infants and adults, much less work has looked at how these
abilities develop from infancy to adulthood, even though
such findings are crucial for understanding the role and
nature of SL abilities. The paucity of research leaves an
important question unanswered: What is the developmental
trajectory of SL across childhood? Is SL an early-maturing

capacity that is stable in an individual across development,
or does it improve with age? On the one hand, SL is already
present in very young infants and postulated to play a role in
language acquisition, suggesting it is an early-maturing
capacity. On the other hand, most other cognitive abilities
do develop with age.
Only few studies have looked at how SL abilities change
during development and they show a mixed pattern of
results (see detailed review in the next section): while some
argue SL is age-invariant (e.g., Saffran, Newport, Aslin,
Tunick, & Barrueco, 1997), others report an improvement
with age (e.g., Arciuli & Simpson, 2011). Because these
studies examined SL in different modalities (auditory vs.
visual), it could be that the effect of age differs across
domains. Importantly, although SL is found in multiple
modalities and with various sensory inputs (e.g., Conway &
Christiansen, 2005), there is growing evidence for modalitybased differences in adults' SL abilities (Frost, Armstrong,
Siegelman & Christiansen, 2015; Krogh, Vlach & Johnson,
2012). If SL is a unitary capacity, we may expect it to
develop similarly across modalities. In contrast, a modalityspecific mechanism may show different developmental
trajectories in different modalities. However, there is little
data that can be brought to bear on these questions.

SL Across Development
In theory, there are several possible predictions on the
developmental trajectory of SL. The first is that SL
improves with age, just like many other cognitive abilities
(e.g. working memory, see Gathercole, Pickering, Ambridge
& Wearing, 2004). This prediction is also motivated by
recent findings from the field of implicit learning. SL is
often seen as a type of implicit learning, occurring without
explicit intent and/or overt awareness (Perruchet & Pacton,
2006). Traditionally, implicit learning mechanisms were
considered to be age-invariant: they were seen as earlymaturing and automatic capacities that do not improve with
age (Reber, 1993). Yet this view has been challenged in
recent years (Lukács & Kemény, 2014). While some studies
support age-invariance (Vinter & Perruchet, 2000; Amso &
Davidow, 2012), there is growing evidence that implicit
learning does improve with age (Vaidya, Huger, Howard &
Howard Jr, 2007; Janacsek, Fiser, & Nemeth, 2012; Lukács
& Kemény, 2014). Since SL involves implicit learning, we
may expect it to show a similar developmental trajectory
and improve with age across modalities (Misyak, Goldstein
& Christiansen, 2012).
A different prediction can be made when we consider the
role of SL in language acquisition. Since infancy and early
childhood are considered to be the prime-time for language
learning (Birdsong, 1999), SL skills may be fully developed

1469

in infancy and not improve with age, a claim supported by
the presence of SL in newborns (Bulf, Johnson, & Valenza,
2011). Such age invariance would be in line with Reber's
claim that some implicit learning mechanisms are earlymaturing. A recent fMRI study suggests that auditory SL
may even become worse with age. McNealy, Mazziotta &
Dapretto (2011) found an age-related decrease in sensitivity
to weak statistical cues: younger children showed better
sensitivity to low transitional probabilities compared to
older children and adults. They suggest that this age-related
decrease may help explain adults’ worse language learning
skills. Under this account, auditory SL skills may even show
a negative age effect and deteriorate with age.
A third, more nuanced, prediction on the effect of age on
SL takes into account modality-based differences. The fact
that SL is found in multiple sensory modalities suggests it is
domain general mechanism that works similarly on different
kinds of input, linguistic and nonlinguistic (Saffran &
Thiessen, 2007; Kirkham, Slemmer & Johnson, 2002;
Saffran, Pollak, Seibel & Shkolnik, 2007). This idea
receives support from the correlation between visual SL and
auditory linguistic measures (Shafto et al., 2012). However,
there is growing evidence of differences in learning between
the auditory and visual domains that are more consistent
with a modality-sensitive model of SL (Frost et al., 2015).
On an individual level, performance on auditory and
visual SL tasks is not correlated, indicating they may tap
onto different abilities (Siegelman & Frost, 2015). There
also seem to be qualitative differences in learning across
modalities, though studies differ in which modality shows
better learning: Siegelman & Frost (2015) found that adults
were better in the visual domain, while other studies found
that adults showed better learning in the auditory domain
(Conway & Christiansen, 2005; Saffran, 2002). This
difference may also be modulated by constraints involving
presentation rate: increasing stimuli presentation rate led to
better learning the auditory domain, but worse learning in
the visual domain (Emberson, Conway & Christiansen,
2011). One way of reconciling these findings is by
characterizing SL as a domain general mechanism that
applies similar computational principles to all input types
but that is nevertheless modality-specific in that it reflects
the particular constraints and perceptual biases imposed by
different sensory input (Frost et al. 2015).
From a developmental perspective, age may affect
learning differently in the visual and auditory domains. In
particular, given its role in language acquisition, auditory
SL may change less with age (or not at all) compared to
visual SL. Such a finding would provide support for the
modality-sensitive nature of SL. Yet there is currently very
little empirical evidence to support any of these predictions
or distinguish between them. To date, only few studies have
examined the effect of age on SL, and they display a mixed
pattern of results. Interestingly, some of the differences
could be modality related.
In the visual domain, two studies that compared children
and adults on the same task found no effect of age. Bertels,

Boursain, Destrebecqz, & Gaillard (2015) report that
children (aged 9 to 12) performed similarly to adults on a
visual SL task. Jost, Conway, Purdy, Walk, & Hendricks
(2015) found similar ERP patterns during a visual SL task
among younger children (8-year-olds), older children (11year-olds) and adults. Infants’ visual SL also does not seem
to change between 2- and 8-months (Kirkham et al., 2002).
Overall, these findings seem to point to age-invariance in
visual SL. However, they are based on quite small samples,
examine a relatively narrow slice of development and
compare groups of children in given ages rather than
examining age as a continuous factor, all of which may
mask the effect of age on performance (Arciuli & van Kos
Torkisden, 2012; Bertals et al., 2015). Accordingly, a more
comprehensive study of visual SL across development did
find clear age-related improvement: Arciuli & Simpson
(2011) examined visual SL in 183 children between the ages
of 5 and 12 and found that older children showed
significantly better learning. This single comprehensive
study suggests that visual SL does in fact improve with age.
Crucially, even less work examined SL across
development in the auditory domain, despite its postulated
role in language acquisition. Only one study compared
children and adults on the same auditory task and reported
age-invariance: Saffran et al. (1997) found no difference in
auditory SL between 6-year-olds and undergraduate
students, with both age groups showing similar learning.
This is somewhat surprising given that auditory grammar
learning (AGL) improves with age, with adults showing
better learning than six and nine-year-olds (Saffran, 2001).
Studies on auditory SL during infancy also suggest agerelated changes in early development. Specifically, infants'
auditory learning biases change between 8- and 10-months
(Emberson, Misyak, Schwade, Christiansen & Goldstein,
2015), and they show improved auditory SL abilities
between 12- and 15-months (Gómez & Maye, 2005).
In sum, while Arciuili & Simpson's (2011) findings
suggest that visual SL improves throughout development,
the only study to compare auditory SL in children and adults
found no difference between them. One possibility is that
age does affect SL in the auditory modality as well, but that
this pattern is not detected when using relatively small
samples and comparing only one age group to adults (as in
Saffran et al., 1997). Alternatively, it is possible that there
are fundamental differences between visual and auditory SL
that are also reflected in different developmental trajectories
across modalities. In particular, SL may improve less in the
auditory domain, or even show age invariance across
childhood. These possibilities are hard to evaluate given the
existing literature, as no study has examined auditory SL
across development in a comprehensive way as was done in
the visual domain by Arciuli & Simpson (2011).

The Current Study
To test the different predictions on the effect of age on
auditory SL, we conducted the first large-scale, crosssectional study of children's performance on an auditory SL

1470

task (ASL) across a wide age-range (5-12y). We ask
whether performance is affected by age, and if so - then
how: will auditory SL abilities improve across development
as found in the visual domain, or will they show a different
developmental trajectory?

Method
Our task was closely modeled on the classic segmentation
task from Saffran et al. (1996). The task was completely
computerized, with a human experimenter sitting by the
children and providing them with verbal instructions.

Participants
115 children (age range: 5-12y, mean age: 8:3y, 63 boys and
52 girls). All children were visitors at the Bloomfield
Science Museum in Jerusalem and were recruited for this
study as part of their visit to the Israeli Living Lab. All
participants received a small educational reward in return
for participation. Parental consent was obtained for all
children. All children were native Hebrew speakers, and
none of them had known language or learning disabilities.

Materials
The auditory stimuli consisted of a synthesized "alien"
language, containing 5 unique tri-syllabic words (made up
of 15 different syllables): "dukame", "gedino", "kimuga",
"nalobi" and "tobelu". All words were synthesized using the
PRAAT software in order to control for syllable duration
and frequency. Average word length was 850ms. The words
were concatenated together in a semi-randomized order
(with the constraint that no word will appear twice in a row)
to create an auditory familiarization stream. In this stream,
the transitional probabilities (TPs) between syllables within
a word was always 1, while the TPs between words were
0.25 (because syllables were not repeated across words).
The exposure phase lasted 2;20 minutes, with each word
repeated 32 times. Importantly, there were no breaks
between words and no prosodic or co-articulation cues in
the stream to indicate word boundaries.
The test phrase included 25 two alternative forced-choice
trials (2AFC), in which participants heard two possible
"words" (separated by 500ms), and had to choose which one
sounds more like the language they just heard. On each trial,
participants heard a real word (like "dukame") either
followed or preceded by a foil word. Foil words were
constructed by taking the first syllable from one word,
followed by the second syllable form another word, and the
third syllable from a third word. Thus, each syllable in the
foil words appeared in a similar position in real words, but
with different surrounding syllables (for example, "kilome"
or "dubega"). This created a difference in the statistical
properties of the words and foils: while the TPs between
every two adjacent syllables within a word are 1, the TPs
between every two syllables in a foil test item are 0, as
participants never heard these syllables one after the other
during familiarization. If participants learn the statistical
properties of the syllables in the stream, they should be able

to distinguish between words and foils. The possible score
on this task ranged from 0% accuracy (0/25 trails correct) to
100% (25/25 trails correct).

Procedure
Children were told they are about to hear an alien language,
and were then exposed to the familiarization stream using
isolating headphones. A picture of an alien in a spaceship
appeared on the screen during the entire duration of the
familiarization stream. Following exposure, children were
told that they are about to hear an alien who is not a good
speaker of the alien language, and that they must help him
by telling him which of the two words he will say sounds
more like the alien language they just heard.
The 25 test trails were presented to children in random
order (with the constraint that the same word/foil will not
appear in two consecutive trails). The order of words and
foils on each trial was also randomized, so that half the trials
were word-first trials (the word was heard before the foil)
and half were foil-first trials (the foil was heard before the
word). After hearing both possibilities, children were asked
to press either '1' or '2' according to whether they thought
the correct word was the first or the second they heard. In
case children felt they didn't know the answer, the
experimenter encouraged them to try and guess what sounds
more familiar according to the alien language they heard. At
the end of the task, the experimenter thanked the child for
helping the alien learn the language, and showed them to the
prize basket to pick their reward for participation.

Results
As a group, children showed learning in the auditory task
with a mean accuracy score of 55%, which is significantly
above chance (t(114)=4.74, SE=1, p<0.0001). Figure 1
shows children's mean performance on the task as a function
of age (in half years): age seems to affect performance with
older children showing better accuracy. To test for
significance, we used a mixed-effect logistic regression
model. Our dependent binominal variable was success in a
single ASL test trial (see Table 1a). The model included
fixed effects for age (in half years) and trial number as
centered continuous factors, order of appearance in the test
(word-first trials vs. general mean, deviation coding) and
gender (females vs. general mean, deviation coding).
Following Barr et al. (2013), the model had the maximal
random effects structure that would converge, including
random intercepts for participants and items, by-participant
slopes for trial number and order of appearance, and byitems slopes for age and order of appearance.
The model showed that age had a significant positive
effect on performance, with older children displaying better
accuracy (β=0.05, SE=0.02, p<0.05). The effect of gender
was not significant (β=-0.05, SE=0.04, p>0.1). Trial number
was also not a significant predictor of accuracy (β=-0.004,
SE=0.005, p>0.1), confirming that no learning (or
unlearning) was happening during the test phase itself,
despite the repetitions of both foils and words.

1471

Interestingly, order of appearance in the test highly
affected performance, with better accuracy on word-first
trials (β=0.15, SE=0.03, p<0.001). Thus, children were
better in trials where the real word was heard before the foil.
Since the order of presentation was counter-balanced this
could not reflect a preference for pressing 1 or 2. The
advantage for word-first trials could reflect the "interval
bias" found in 2AFC tasks in which the first word is used as
a baseline for assessing the "wordness" of the next item
(Einhom & Hogarth, 1981; García-Pérez & AlcaláQuintana, 2011).
These results suggest that auditory SL improves with age.
However, a somewhat different pattern emerged when we
examined participants’ performance in different age bins 1
(matched in number of participants, see Table 2).

We found that children in the youngest age group (ages
five to six) did not show significant learning: unlike
children in all other age groups, their performance did not
differ from chance (M=48%, t(20)=-0.786, SE=2, p=0.44).
This is also reflected in Figure 1, which shows that the
majority of children aged 6 and below are performing at
chance level (we will address this issue in the discussion).
We therefore conducted a second analysis to see if the
effect of age on performance was driven by the inclusion of
the youngest age group that showed no learning. We ran an
additional model with a similar effects structure using the
data obtained only from children older than 6, excluding the
21 children in the youngest age bin (Table 1b).
As suspected, the effect of age disappeared in the new
model: without the youngest group of children, who showed
chance-level performance, age was no longer predicative of
accuracy (β=0.02, SE=0.02, p>0.1). That is, auditory SL did
not show an improvement between the ages of 6.5 and 12, a
significant developmental window. In line with previous
reports (Saffran et al. 1997), this finding suggests that
auditory SL is a rather stable, age-invariant capacity across
childhood, at least after age 6.

Discussion
Our study shows that auditory SL did not improve with age
after excluding the youngest age group of children (aged 6
and below), who performed at chance. Even though we
initially found an age-related improvement in the task, our
second analysis showed that this effect was driven by the
youngest group of children, who simply did not show
learning. After excluding this group, we found no
significant change in children's auditory SL skills across
development (between the ages of 6.5 to 12y). This result
differs from the findings of Arciuli & Simpson (2011), who
reported an improvement with age in the visual domain, and
is in line with Saffran et al. (1997), who found ageinvariance in the auditory domain when comparing six-yearolds to adults on a similar auditory segmentation task. That
is, auditory SL, unlike visual SL, seems to be age invariant.
The finding that auditory SL is age-invariant across
development is supportive of Reber's claim that some
implicit learning mechanisms, presumably those that are
used early in life may not be affected by age. The ageinvariance seen in this study is consistent with the
postulated role of auditory SL in language acquisition (e.g.,
Saffran et al., 1996), and the fact that language learning
skills are at their prime during infancy and early childhood
(Birdsong, 1999).

1472

Our findings also points to modality-based differences in
the developmental trajectory of SL abilities: unlike visual
SL (Arciuli & Simpson, 2011), auditory SL did not change
during development. This finding also strengthens the claim
that the improvement reported in the visual domain by
Arciuili & Simpson (2011) reflects true changes in SL, and
is not merely the result of general improvement in other
cognitive abilities related to task performance (e.g.,
attention, working memory). If the improvement in visual
SL was caused by the maturation of other cognitive skills,
we would expect a parallel pattern across domains, which is
not the case. Taken together, our study supports modalitysensitive models of SL where the type of stimuli has an
effect on learning (Frost et al., 2015).
Importantly, not enough is known about the nature of the
difference between modalities as no direct comparison was
made between auditory and visual SL in children using
tasks with similar input statistics. Our task differed from
that of Arciuli & Simpson (2011) in having five words
compared to four visual triplets: while it is possible this
affected the results, it is unlikely to have caused the effect of
age to disappear. If anything, the boundaries between words
are more marked in our study (because of the larger number
of words). Nevertheless, to comprehensively assess possible
modality-based differences in the developmental trajectory
of SL skills, a direct comparison should be made between
auditory and visual SL skills using similar populations,
similar designs, similar statistical properties of the input,
similar exposure and preferably the same children
performing both tasks to detect correlations in learning
across domains.
Our results are limited in an important respect: we found
that children below 6 did not show any explicit learning in
our task. Since infants do exhibit significant learning in
ASL when using more implicit tasks (e.g, Saffran et al.,
1996), it is possible the youngest children are capable of
learning the auditory regularities but fail in manifesting this
knowledge using more explicit tasks. Children under six
may be too young to exhibit their implicit knowledge and/or
to understand the verbal instructions given to them. Indeed,
studies show that it is significantly harder for young
children to learn an artificial language in laboratory settings,
resulting in inferior performance overall (Ferman & Karni,
2010; Folia et al., 2010). Consequently, more implicit tasks
should be used in future studies with younger children
(before age 6).
Such findings – from early childhood – are crucial in
understanding the developmental trajectory of auditory SL.
This time period is the one in which children's language
skills develop the most, and in which many other cognitive
changes occur. It could be that auditory SL skills only
improve until a certain period in childhood and remain
steady from that point on. In other words, auditory SL may
be fully developed by the first year of life, or may develop
only during early childhood.

Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that auditory statistical
learning does not improve with age during childhood, but is
at adult capacity by age six. This finding suggests that
auditory SL is an early-maturing and stable capacity in an
individual. However, more research is required to (a)
examine whether SL abilities in different modalities are
affected differently by age, and (b) examine the
developmental trajectory or SL from infancy to early
childhood. Future work should compare the developmental
trajectories of auditory and visual learning across
development using similar tasks, and studies with younger
children should employ more implicit tests.
