people are able to take physical attributes such as viscosity
into account when making fluid-related judgments (Schwartz
& Black, 1999). Bates et al. (2015) also found that their par-
ticipants’ judgments were sensitive to latent attributes of the
fluid (e.g., stickiness and viscosity).
   To quantify the extent that humans employ their perceived
viscosity of fluids in subsequent reasoning tasks, we utilized
a recent development in graphical fluid simulation (Bridson,
2008; Jiang, Schroeder, Selle, Teran, & Stomakhin, 2015) to
simulate the dynamic behavior of fluids in vivid animations.
Previous work has shown that realistic animations can facili-
