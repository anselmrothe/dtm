   SCS also appeared to be a stronger predictor of subjects’
engagement with the clip than did their ordinary science
intelligence (OSI) scores. See Figure 5. One would expect
science comprehension to predict engagement with a
science documentary. However, because taking pleasure in
contemplating scientific discovery and the capacity to
recognize and make use of scientific evidence are distinct

measure to be more discerning of engagement.
   Although it is uncommon for researchers to present
evidence behaviorally validating curiosity scales,
investigations of such scales typically find that the
disposition being measured reduces to reasoning proficiency
