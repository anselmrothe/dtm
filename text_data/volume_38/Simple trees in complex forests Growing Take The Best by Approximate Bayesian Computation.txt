Figure 6: Assessed computational effort (log-number of proposal trees, N), performance (mean correct predictions,
MCP), and trade-off (proportion correct predictions per proposal generated) for different -œÜ-combinations. Number
of samples go up exponentially when bigger proportions are sampled and only high quality proposals are accepted.
Performance also goes up, but there is a diminishing returns effect whereby increasingly less additional correct
predictions are generated per generated proposal.
