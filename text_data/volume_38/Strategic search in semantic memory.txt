provided the following evidence to support this claim.
   First, the retrieval process was best described by models
with a finite threshold, which implies switching between lo-
cal and global strategies. The infinite threshold model had
the lowest AIC for only 6% of participants. Furthermore, the
best model assumes that the time of this switching depends on
the quality of the local neighbourhood, which can be approx-
imated by a maximally local measure of proximity, MP. The
MP model has the lowest AIC for 75% of participants. This
