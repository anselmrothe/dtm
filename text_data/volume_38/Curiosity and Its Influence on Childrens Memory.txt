correct answer or stated that they did not know or that they
forgot the answer. Since we used child-friendly trivia
questions most of the answers consisted of one word
however some of the answers contained two words such as
‘argentine lizzard’ or ‘wild prairie rose’. If a child
responded with a key word or phrase such as ‘argentine’ or
‘prairie rose’ the response was coded as correct. However,
if the child responded with a word from the answer that was
not a key word or phrase such as ‘lizzard’ or ‘wild rose’ the
response was coded as incorrect.
