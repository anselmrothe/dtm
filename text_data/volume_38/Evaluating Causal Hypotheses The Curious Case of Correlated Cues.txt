The computation of 𝑝 !!!! (𝐷|𝜽, 𝐺! ) raises well know issues
regarding how people estimate the likelihood of sequences
of events. For example, if the likelihood of the effect 𝐸 in
some context is .50, then presumably people will judge a
sequence in which 𝐸 is always present as less probable than
one in which 𝐸 is present about half the time, in the same
way that a fair coin is viewed as unlikely to yield a long run
of all heads or all tails as compared to a mixed sequence
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1972; also see Maloney et al.,
2004). This concern is especially relevant in the current ex-
periments in which observations are presented simultane-
ously rather than sequentially, making non-representative
samples easier to detect. Accordingly, here we use the bi-
nomial distribution as a first order approximation of
𝑝 !!!! (𝐷|𝜽, 𝐺! ). In particular,
    𝑝!! !! (𝐷|𝜽, 𝐺! ) =       𝐵(𝑁(𝑒 = 1, 𝒄); 𝑁(𝒄), 𝑝(𝑒 = 1|𝒄))          (4)

     Use of a binomial distribution introduces a normalizing con-               relative likelihoods. Use of a binomial distribution may also be less
