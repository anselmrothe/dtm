presentation of the smell (i.e., during encoding). These
studies have shown access to a meaningful label improves
memory, and having access to a “veridical” label improves
odor memory the most (Cessna & Frank, 2013; Jehl, Royet,
& Holley, 1997; Olsson, Lundgren, Soares, & Johansson,
2009; Russell & Boakes, 2011). When participants selfgenerate a label for odors during encoding, this also leads to
improved memory for those odors (Frank, Rybalsky,
Brearton, & Mannea, 2011; Lehrner, Glück, & Laska, 1999;
Lesschaeve & Issanchou, 1996). This holds true even when
people describe complex flavor stimuli such as wines (Fiore
et al., 2012; Hughson & Boakes, 2009). There is also some
suggestive evidence for a causal role for language in odor
memory. When an odor memory task is paired with a verbal
interference task, subsequent odor recognition is poorer than
when it is paired with a visual interference task (Annett,
Cook, & Leslie, 1995; Annett & Leslie, 1996; Perkins &
Cook, 1990). Taken together, these studies suggest language
plays a critical role in how odors are remembered.
Through years of training and practice, experts acquire
theoretical knowledge, perceptual experience, and train their
verbal capacities in the domain of their expertise. Becoming
an expert has effects on cognition, including memory and
language. For example, chess experts have better memory
for chess game layouts than novices (e.g., Chase & Simon,
1973; Gobet, 1998), while expert musicians are better able
to judge the grammaticality of sentences than novices
(Patston & Tippett, 2011).
To become an acknowledged wine expert, a person must
study wine for many years. Even after becoming a
professional in the field of wine, training and practice
continues. An important part of what a wine expert does in
their job is to recognize specific aromas and flavors in wine.
Wine experts are better than novices at remembering the
“flavors” of wine (i.e., a combination of mouth sensation
and smell; Melcher & Schooler, 1996), as well as the
(orthonasal) smells (i.e., “sniffing”) of wines (Zucco,
Carassai, Baroni, & Stevenson, 2011) and wine-related
odors (Parr, Heatherbell, & White, 2002; Parr, White, &
Heatherbell, 2004). So, it seems wine experts have better
memory for stimuli salient in their domain of expertise.
For olfaction experts, smells and flavors are said to be
more important in their daily life than for the average person
(Royet, Plailly, Saive, Veyrac, & Delon-Martin, 2013).
However, what consequences expertise has for the language

Abstract
Although people are poor at naming odors, naming a smell
helps to remember that odor. Previous studies show wine
experts have better memory for smells, and they also name
wine and wine-related smells differently than novices. This
leads us to ask whether wine experts’ odor memory is
verbally mediated? In addition, does the odor memory
advantage that experts have over novices generalize to all
odors, or is it restricted to odors in their domain of expertise?
Twenty-four wine experts and 24 novices smelled wines,
wine-related odors and common odors, and were asked to
remember these. Critically, half of the participants were asked
to name the smells in addition to memorizing them, while the
other half just remembered the smells. Wine experts had
better memory for wines, but not for wine-related or common
odors, indicating their memory is restricted to odors from
their domain of expertise. Wine experts were also found to be
more consistent and accurate than novices in their
descriptions. But there was no relationship between experts’
ability to name odors and their memory for odors. This
suggests experts’ odor memory advantage is not linguistically
mediated, but may be the result of differential perceptual
learning.

Introduction
People from the West are poor at describing smells (Majid,
2015; Olofsson & Gottfried, 2015; Yeshurun & Sobel,
2010). When asked to name smells, they rarely exceed
naming more than 50% of them correctly (Cain, 1979;
Engen, 1987; Yeshurun & Sobel, 2010; Olofsson &
Gottfried, 2015). In contrast, a large body of literature
shows remembering smells is relatively easy, as
demonstrated by an almost flat forgetting curve. Even after
a month, people still recognize around 75% of previously
smelled odors correctly (Cain, 1979; Engen, 1987; Herz &
Engen, 1996; Schab, 1991).
Given the discrepancy between odor naming and odor
memory, surprisingly having the correct label for a smell
can increase memory for it. Herz and Engen (1996)
concluded “the jury was still out” (p. 303) on whether odor
memory is verbally mediated. However, many studies since
their review have found language can improve memory for
odors and flavors. A number of studies have tested
participants’ odor memory while providing them with a
label generated by the experimenter during the initial

141

used to describe smells remains unclear. For example,
Lawless (1984) found little agreement in the descriptions of
wine from wine experts versus novices, and wine experts
are apparently not more consistent than novices in their
descriptions of wine-related smells (Parr et al., 2002).
On the other hand, in a recent study Croijmans and Majid
(2016) found wine experts were more consistent than
novices when describing the smell and flavor of real wines.
Wine experts have also been found to be able to select the
correct label for odors more often than novices (Bende &
Nordin, 1997; Marino-Sanchez et al., 2010; Tempere,
Hamtat, de Revel, & Sicard, 2015), and they seem to be
more precise in their descriptions for wines and wine-related
odors (Chollet & Valentin, 2000; Lehrer, 1983; Melcher &
Schooler, 1996; Solomon, 1990, 1997; Zucco et al., 2011).
Overall, then, wine experts appear to describe smells from
their domain of expertise with more consistency and
exactness than novices.
Brown and Lenneberg (1954) pioneered the idea that
when a percept is expressed more consistently and concisely
in language (i.e., when it is “codable”), it is remembered
better. Can wine experts’ aptitude for describing smells help
their memory for odors? Previous studies do not give a
satisfying answer. Melcher and Schooler (1996) found no
difference when experts gave a verbal description of wines
compared to a non-verbal condition, although experts were
better than novices and intermediates in remembering the
wines they tasted. Similarly, Parr and colleagues (Parr et al.,
2002, 2004) found no significant relationship between the
ability to label wine-related odors and their subsequent
memory for those odors, although wine experts were again
much better at remembering odors than novices. However,
when inspecting the results more closely (Parr et al., 2004,
Table 2, p. 416), a significant recognition memory
difference between experts and novices was only found in
the condition where participants labeled the stimuli (instead
of rating the pleasantness of odors), leaving open the
possibility that wine experts’ memory is perhaps verbally
mediated.
If language is used by experts to remember wines, we
might predict wine experts would only be better at
remembering the smells of wines, or perhaps wine-related
odors, but not other odors (e.g., common household odors).
This is because wine experts appear to be better at naming
smells and flavors only when these came from their specific
area of expertise (Croijmans & Majid, 2016). If language is
used to remember wines, then wine experts should only
show a memory advantage for wine (and, perhaps, winerelated odors), but not common odors. They should also be
better at naming those odors, and there should be a clear
relationship between naming and memory. To test these
hypotheses, we asked wine experts and novices to remember
odors from real wines, wine-related odors, and common
household odors unrelated to wine. One group of
participants was asked to name the stimuli (verbal
condition), while another group smelled the odors without
verbalization (baseline condition).

Methods
Participants
Forty-eight people participated in the experiment. Twentyfour were experts (6 women, Mage = 49, SD = 9, age range
29 – 60), and worked as qualified vinologists, sommeliers or
wine producers. The other 24 people were novices (6
women, Mage = 47, SD = 13, age range 26 – 71). All
participants were native speakers of Dutch, and were paid
with a €15 voucher.
To confirm expertise, all participants completed a
questionnaire assessing their knowledge of wine (following
Hughson & Boakes, 2001; Lehrer, 1983; Melcher &
Schooler, 1996). A non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test
confirmed all wine experts had significantly higher scores
than novices, U = 0.0, p < 0.001, r = 0.86.
Half the participants from each group were randomly
allocated to the verbal condition, and half to the baseline
condition.
Materials
Forty-eight stimuli were used in this study. There were 16
different red and white wines, selected for their
distinctiveness. There were 16 wine-related smells from the
“Le nez du vin” kit (Lenoir, 1995), i.e., aromas that can be
found in wine, including wine faults. A further 16 were
common household smells, using real objects, ranging from
cleaning and beauty products, herbs and spices, to food. All
smells were presented in small 30 ml brown screwtop jars.
A small tuft of scentless polyester hollow fiber in each jar
obscured the object inside so the participant could not see it.
Procedure
Twenty-four of the 48 stimuli (four white and four red
wines, eight wine-related smells, and eight common smells;
all chosen at random) were presented to the participant in
random order during the encoding phase. Participants were
informed there were three types of smells (i.e. wines, winerelated smells and common smells). In the verbal condition,
participants were instructed to smell the odors and name
them as quickly and precisely as they could. In the baseline
condition, participants were just asked to remember the
odors as best as they could. All participants were told they
would be tested for their odor memory later.
After going through the 24 smells in the encoding phase,
there was a 10-minute break in which participants
completed the wine knowledge questionnaire, and two other
questionnaires.
In the recognition phase, participants smelled all 48
stimuli one by one, and told the experimenter for each of the
odors whether they had smelled the odors before. They
named all the odors too.

Results
Odor memory
We first analyzed participants’ recognition memory. Were
experts better at remembering odors than novices? In
addition, were they better in the verbal condition than in the

142

baseline? Following detection theory, hits and false alarms
were first coded from participants’ responses for each odor
type. From these values, d’ was calculated (Macmillan &
Creelman, 1991; Parr et al., 2002). The larger the d’, the
better the participants were able to distinguish between old
and new odors. A three-way mixed ANOVA with expertise
(wine expert vs. novice) and condition (verbal vs. baseline)
as between-participant factors, and odor type (wine, winerelated, vs. common) as a within-participant factor was
conducted, with d’ as the dependent variable.
Experts were no better at remembering odors overall than
novices, F (1, 44) = 0.64, p = .427, ηp² = .01, and naming
the odors during encoding did not improve memory, F (1,
44) = 0.46, p = .503, ηp² = .01. There was, however, a main
effect of odor type. Common odors and wine-related odors
were remembered better than wines, F (2, 88) = 41.53, p <
.001, ηp² = .49. There was no significant interaction
between expertise and verbal condition, F (1, 44) = 1.40, p
= .244, ηp² = .03, and no significant three-way interaction
between verbal condition, expertise, and odor type F (2, 88)
= 0.92, p = .402, ηp² = .02. So it appears experts do not
benefit any more from verbalizing smells than novices.
There was no overall effect of expertise on odor memory,
but we had specifically predicted experts’ memory for odors
would be restricted to smells in their domain of expertise
(i.e., to wines and wine-related odors). The interaction
between expertise and odor type was not significant, F (2,
43) = 2.35, p = .108, ηp² = .10, but Bonferroni corrected
pairwise comparisons (as recommended by Hsu, 1996)
demonstrated wine experts were significantly better at
remembering the smells of wines (M = 0.23, SD = 0.56)
than novices (M = -0.13, SD = 0.57), p = .036, d = .63. This
was not true for wine-related smells, for which wine experts
did not differ significantly from (M = 1.1, SD = 0.72)
novices (M = 1.3, SD = 0.75), p = .394, nor was there a
significant difference between experts and novices for
common household smells (wine experts, M = 1.2, SD =
0.60, vs. novices, M = 1.0, SD = 0.97), p = .548.
Overall, these analyses show wine odors were particularly
hard to remember for both experts and novices.
Nevertheless, wine experts were better than novices at
remembering whether they had previously smelled a
specific wine. The results also suggest naming odors
explicitly during encoding did not help improve odor
memory, consistent with the suggestion experts’ superior
memory for wine odors is not verbally mediated. To test this
proposal more directly, we conducted additional analyses
examining the relationship between naming and memory.

then again during recognition. The answers for those
participants were coded for consistency (i.e., did they give
the same label during encoding and recognition?). In
addition, the labels of all participants during the recognition
phase were coded for accuracy. An answer was considered
correct if participants gave the same answer as the predetermined “veridical” label. For wines it was considered
correct if participants gave the correct color, grape type, or
production country. Coding was done by the experimenter
and one independent researcher.
A two-way mixed ANOVA with expertise and odor type
as factors, and percentage of consistently named odors as
the dependent variable, showed wine experts (M = 47.5, SD
= 23.8) gave more consistent labels than novices (M = 29.3,
SD = 19.0), F (1, 44) = 12.24, p = .002, ηp² = .36. There was
also a main effect of odor type, F (2, 44) = 16.37, p < .001,
ηp² = .42. Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparisons
showed common odors (M = 46.2, SD = 23.9) were more
consistently named than wine odors (M = 18.2, SD = 21.2),
p = .018, d = .8. Wine-related odors (M = 50.9, SD = 24.8)
were also more consistently named than wine odors, p =
.009, d = 1.0. There was no difference between common
odors and wine-related odors, p = .332. There was no
interaction between expertise and odor type, F (2, 44) =
0.82, p = .448, ηp² = .04, but Bonferroni corrected pairwise
comparisons showed wine experts gave more consistent
answers for wine odors (M = 28.1, SD = 21.4) than novices
(M = 8.3, SD = 16.3), p = .018, d = 1.0. Wine experts also
gave more consistent answers for wine-related odors (M =
63.5, SD = 24.1) than novices (M = 38.3, SD = 19.0), p
=.009, d = 1.2. But there was no difference between wine
experts (M = 51.0, SD = 25.8) and novices (M = 41.4, SD =
21.8), p = .332, for common odors.
This analysis was also repeated with percentage of
correctly named odors as the dependent variable. Wine
experts (M = 33.0, SD = 17.0) named more odors correctly
than novices (M = 24.8, SD = 19.2), F (1, 46) = 4.91, p =
.032, ηp² = .10, and wines were more often correctly named
than wine-related odors or common odors, F (2, 45) = 5.7, p
= .006, ηp² = .20. There was no interaction between
expertise and stimulus type, F (2, 92) = 1.6, p = .217, ηp² =
.03, but Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparisons showed
wine experts (M = 44.8, SD = 25.4) were more accurate in
naming wines than novices (M = 29.7, SD = 26.1), p = .048,
d = .59. This was not the case for wine-related odors (wine
experts M = 26.8, SD = 12.7 vs. novices M = 20.3, SD =
14.4), p = .104, d = .48 or common odors (wine experts M =
27.6, SD = 13.0 vs. novices M = 24.5, SD = 17.1), p = .480,
d = .20. In line with the results for consistently named
odors, wine experts had a domain-specific advantage for
accurately naming wine odors, but not other types of odors.
To summarize, experts were more consistent and accurate
than novices when naming wine odors. In addition, experts
were also more consistent (but not more accurate) than
novices when naming wine-related odors. Odor naming for
common odors was comparable across experts and novices.

Odor naming
Previous studies with novices suggest remembering an odor
successfully depends on the ability to name that odor
accurately and consistently (e.g., Cessna & Frank, 2013;
Fiore et al., 2012; Frank, Rybalsky, Brearton, & Mannea,
2011). Therefore, we first examined the naming data more
closely. Half the participants named odors twice during the
experiment (verbal condition); i.e., during encoding and

143

consistent than novices, but only for the odors from their
domain of expertise. This replicates the finding of
Croijmans and Majid (2016) that wine experts name wine
odors, but not common odors, more consistently than
novices. Note, the current study adds a new dimension to
the issue. Croijmans and Majid (2016) found wine experts
as a group were more consistent with each other in how they
talk about wine odors than novices, whereas the current
study shows experts are also more consistent with
themselves when they name the same wine odors at two
different times (cf. Brown & Lenneberg, 1954).
Since language influences odor memory amongst novices
(Fiore et al., 2012; Frank et al., 2011; Lehrner et al., 1999;
Lesschaeve & Issanchou, 1996), we asked whether it was
also the basis of wine experts’ superior memory for wine
odors. But there was little evidence in support of this
proposal. Experts were no better at remembering wine odors
in the verbal condition than the baseline (i.e., non-verbal)
condition. Moreover, there was no significant correlation
between odor memory for wines and odor naming accuracy
or naming consistency.
To recap, wine experts were only better at remembering
the odors of wines, but they were more consistent and
accurate in both their descriptions of wines and wine-related
odors. During wine experts’ training, they are taught to
identify and name different aroma components of wines
(Herdenstam, Hammarén, Ahlström, & Wiktorsson, 2009;
Lehrer, 1983). This is exactly the sort of skill the Le nez du
vin kit (Lenoir, 1995) is designed to help with. So, the
greater consistency for naming wine-related odors probably
comes from specific training to identify wine-related odors.
Wines are complex. They can contain up to 800 different
volatiles (Ortega-Heras, González-SanJosé, & Beltrán,
2002). When remembering the odors of wines, experts
appear to remember the whole gestalt rather than the
individual components of a wine. An analogy can be made
to memory for faces. Humans are excellent at remembering
faces, yet perform poorly when having to recall individual
features of faces, such as a nose, eye, or mouth (Tanaka &
Farah, 1993). Expert memory for wines, similarly, appears
to be holistic instead of featural.
Another analogy can be made to chess experts. Chess
experts are better at remembering the layout of chess plays
than novices (Frey & Adesman, 1976; Gobet & Simon,
1996). However, these layouts have to be possible
configurations that are encountered during real chess games.
Experts are no better than novices at remembering randomly
assembled layouts (Frey & Adesman, 1976; Gobet, 1998).
This suggests chess experts have learned to remember
particular configurations of arrays.
These analogies suggest wine experts are perceptually
processing wines in a different way to novices (e.g.,
Hughson and Boakes, 2009). As wine students become
experts, it seems a shift occurs which encourages the
holistic processing of wines. Aside from the perceptual
gestalt, this representation likely includes knowledge about
the specific wine from its particular region made from

Relationship between odor memory and odor naming
So, was naming consistency and accuracy related to experts’
superior memory for wine odors? To test this, the
correlations between d’ and naming consistency, and d’ and
naming accuracy were calculated for the different stimuli,
for wine experts and novices separately (see Table 1).
The correlation analyses replicated the previously
established finding (e.g., Cessna & Frank, 2013) that
novices have better odor memory for common odors they
named correctly, r = .523, p = .004. They also have better
memory for wine-related odors they named correctly, r =
.518, p = .005. No other correlations were significant for
this group.
For wine experts, there was a similar trend of better
memory for correctly named common odors r = .309, p =
.071, but this was not significant. Similarly, there was a
positive correlation between naming accuracy and memory
for wine-related odors, r = .463, p = .011. Critically,
memory for wine odors and naming consistency and
accuracy were not positively correlated (see Table 1); in
fact, if anything, memory for wines and naming accuracy
had a small (insignificant) negative relationship. Taken
together, these results suggest the superior memory for wine
odors displayed by wine experts is not verbally mediated,
even though they seem to remember wine-related odors and
common odors by their names, just like novices.

Discussion
Wine experts were better than novices at remembering the
odor of wines. This replicates a number of previous studies
(Hughson & Boakes, 2009; Melcher & Schooler, 1996), and
corroborates the proposal that wine experts superior
memory for odors is restricted to wines (Zucco et al., 2011).
Wine experts were no better than novices at remembering
common household odors, or even wine-related odors.
We also found wine experts were more consistent and
accurate than novices when naming wines, and this
extended to wine-related odors. This is an interesting
finding in its own right. Previous studies suggest wine
experts’ descriptions are highly idiosyncratic (Lawless,
1984), and experts are no more consistent in their
descriptions for wine-related smells than novices (Parr et al.,
2002, 2004). In this study, experts were more accurate and

144

particular grapes (Solomon, 1997). Wine-related odors,
when presented out of context, seem to be processed
similarly to common odors. This is exemplified by the
relationship between language and memory for wine-related
and common odors in both experts and novices; and also the
absence of a wine-related odor memory advantage amongst
wine experts.
The results from the current study suggest language is not
directly involved in remembering wine odors. However, we
cannot rule out the possibility that experts and novices
recruited language sub-vocally during the baseline task: i.e.,
they could have been naming the odors silently. A better
way to test whether odor memory is verbally mediated
would be to test if experts are still better at remembering
wine odors when performing a simultaneous verbal
interference task. Chess grandmasters are apparently not
hindered in their memory for chess board positions if they
perform a verbal task at the same time as encoding a chess
board layout (Robbins et al., 1996). However, novices’
memory for odors is harmed if they have to perform an odor
memory task simultaneously with a verbal interference task
(e.g. Annett & Leslie, 1996). This raises the interesting
question of what would happen with wine experts if they
have to remember wine odors under verbal interference. If
wine experts’ odor memory is truly not verbally-mediated,
then experts’ odor memory should not be harmed by a
verbal interference paradigm. If, on the other hand, they are
using language (just like novices with common odors), their
advantage for remembering wine odors should disappear.
In conclusion, our results show wine experts are better
than novices at remembering wine odors, and at describing
wines and wine-related odors. However, the results show
little evidence that these two aspects of expert cognition are
related. That is, wine experts’ better memory for wine odors
does not seem to be based on their ability to name wine
odors.
