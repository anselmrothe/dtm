Art is produced for the purposes of self-expression and
evaluated by criteria like beauty or artistic value, making it a
highly subjective domain of culture. Each individual may
have his or her own expressive biases and ideas about
artistic value. The functional pressures guiding the evolution
of art may thus vary across individuals, and the artistic
tradition, therefore, might not show the signature of
directional selection for specific features over several
generations. Additionally, we might expect innovation to
have some functional benefit in art. We therefore predict
low transmission accuracy and also a reduction in the
evolution of simplicity in this domain.
The goals of technology are usually objective and clearly
defined, which leads us to predict high transmission
accuracy of adaptive traits which contribute to achieving the
goal at hand, combined with the predicted pressure for
simplicity.
Unlike technological solutions, which are strongly
constrained by the structure of the problem they have to
solve, linguistic signals are not constrained by the structure
of their referents. Most signals in human languages are                 Figure 1: Experimental setup in one of the trials in the Art

Data analysis. The 216 Lego constructions related to the
three objects common to all conditions (the ball, the flower
and the coin) were manually coded: we recorded the number
of pieces, overall height, width and depth, volume (of the
smallest cuboid box that could contain the construction),
and area of the faces that were external or visible (long
sides, short sides, top and bottom). Using these data, we
estimated complexity using a 3D version of perimetric
complexity, equal to the squared total external and any
internal areas in mm2 divided by the volume contained
within those areas in mm3 (yielding units mm-1). This
measure is an extension of standard 2D perimetric
complexity, equal to the squared length of the inside plus            Figure 2: Complexity in the three domains over generations
