that inherits from a parent has a corresponding frame
element for each element of the parent and can introduce
others. The subframe relation allows frames to act as
ordered arguments to another frame, forming a kind of
script. These relations create a frame-lattice with top-level
frames like Event and specialized inheritors like Motion.
QP Language
   Kuehne (2004) recast QP theory in a frame-semantic
representation to better handle compositionality in language.
Quantity frames fill the argument slots of direct and indirect
influence frames. The influences participate in quantity
transfer descriptions and process frames which capture the
results and activation conditions of a process. We adopt a
representation closer to FrameNet’s, with influences and
quantities related through shared lexical units (see Figure 1)                      Figure 1: QP frames for a sentence
