 Width and Height
 For each block, the width equates the horizontal length of
 each CRB and reflects how long the behavioral module(s) of
 agentx on the x-axis has participated in this joint action
 episode. Similarly, the height measure states how long the
 behavioral module(s) of agenty on the y-axis contributed to
 the same joint activity.
   For example, in Figure 4, BlockB is formed by the child’s
 holding the blue object from 285.9s to 318.6s and then the
 parent’s holding the same object from 280.5s to 286.3s. Thus,
 BlockB’s width is 32.7s and its height is 5.8s. Similarly, the
 sequence of holding events that formed BlockC is that the
 child was holding the red object first from 307.1s to 310.2s,
 then the parent picked up the same red object and held it from
 292.1s to 304.6s. As a result, BlockC’s width is 3.1s and its
 height is 12.5s.
