Two types of behavior were classified as errors: If the
cursor moved into the homing-in zone but then exited it
again, and if the cursor moved outside of the screen borders.
   Participants controlled the cursor by pressing different
keys on the keyboard which incremented the cursor’s
velocity either to the left, to the right, upwards, or
downwards (compare Knoblich & Jordan, 2003). The ‘left-
key’ (LK) and ‘right-key’ (RK) were controlled by the left
hand and the ‘up-key’ and ‘down-key’ were controlled by
the right hand (see Figure 1). If LK was pressed, the cursor
started moving to the left. Another LK press accelerated the
movement to the left, whereas a RK press decelerated it (by
increasing its velocity into the opposite direction). Each key          Figure 2: Contribution angles: For 0° only vertical and for
