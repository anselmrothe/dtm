in their display cues (e.g. Gnepp & Hess, 1986) and conse-
quences of their motives and behaviors (e.g. Yuill, 1984).
More broadly, young children undergo significant changes
in using others’ mental states to predict and explain behav-
iors (Baillargeon, Scott, & He, 2010; Gweon, Dodell-Feder,
Bedny, & Saxe, 2012; Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001). It
is an open question as to how children integrate inferences of
others’ mental states (e.g., goals and beliefs) with knowledge
about the physical world to reason about affective states.
