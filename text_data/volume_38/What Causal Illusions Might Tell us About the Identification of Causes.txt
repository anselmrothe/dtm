slower reflective system using background knowledge. This
effect was consistent across participants and rarely occurred
in the other direction.
    A limitation of Experiment 1 is that we were only able to
measure participants’ impressions of causation well after the
occurrence of the event, rather than as they actually
unfolded in real-time. The results are vulnerable, then, to the
possibility that participants really did not have a strong
initial impression of causation, but merely attributed this
impression after the fact. In Experiment 2, this limitation
was addressed through the use of a real-time measure of
participants’ impressions of causation.
