Abstract

naming response up to 2000 ms and observed that frequency
affects pupil size, even after the naming responses were issued. Geller et al. (2015) reported for a masked priming study
that higher-frequency words elicited an earlier dilation of the
pupil compared to low-frequency words. They also observed
that dilation increased when words had more lexical competitors, both for low- and high-frequency words.
The present study investigates changes in pupil size while
participants read out loud words presented to them one by
one on a computer screen, using an inter-stimuli interval of
around 4000 ms in order to allow the pupil to contract to baseline after each trial. The present study addresses the question
of the extent to which the response to cognitive load in lexical
processing varies across individual participants. The response
of the pupil to a cognitive task has been described mathematically by Hoeks and Levelt (1993) as single smoothly increasing and then slowly decreasing function of time. Wierda,
van Rijn, Taatgen, and Martens (2012) argued that a time series of pupil dilation values can be a superposition of several
such functions, arising as a consequence of several cognitive
events taking place within the window of time under investigation.
If in a controlled task such as word naming the pupil indeed
responds in a fixed and consistent way to the demands of the
task (reading the word, preparing for articulation, controlling
the articulation itself, and preparation for the next trial), then
one would expect the same pupil dilation function for all participants, possibly with minor variations in shape, similar to
minor variations in intercept and slope that one may detect
for linear response functions with the help of (generalized)
linear mixed models. However, when reading styles differ
substantially across participants, a general response function
may not be appropriate. In what follows, we address these
questions using generalized additive mixed modeling (Wood
(2006); see also Baayen, van Rij, de Cat, & Wood, 2016).
First, however, we introduce the details of our naming experiment.

The present study investigates individual differences in pupil
dilation during standard word naming. We looked at (i) how
individual subjects’ pupil size changes over the course of time
and (ii) how well pupil size is predicted by the frequency of
the stimuli. The time course of the pupil size was analysed
with generalized additive modeling. The results show large individual variations in the pupil response pattern in this very
simple task. Although, we see a pupil response to both stimulus onset and articulation onset and offset, both the amplitude
of change and the direction of change differ substantially between subjects. This raises the question of what makes the
pupil response functions so diverse, and one factor indicated
by the frequency effect or the lack thereof might be shallow
reading versus reading for content.

Introduction
The eye’s pupil diameter size reflects changes in luminance, emotional state, but also cognitive processes (Ahern
& Beatty, 1979; Hess & Polt, 1960; Kahnemann & Beatty,
1966; Young & Biersdorf, 1954). For example, Kahnemann
and Beatty (1966) conducted a recall task to show that pupil
size can be used to measure mental effort. The recall of
more complex number strings triggered a stronger pupil response compared to the recall of less complex strings. Pupil
dilation has also been found to reflect linguistic processing,
such as the complexity of a linguistic task (Hyönä, Tommola,
& Alaja, 1995), sentence intelligibility (Zekveld, Kramer, &
Festen, 2010), sentence complexity (Ben-Nun, 1986; Just &
Carpenter, 1993; Schluroff et al., 1986) and spoken language
comprehension (Engelhardt, Ferreira, & Patsenko, 2010).
Finally, pupil diameter has been used to investigate lexical processing costs (Geller, Still, & Morris, 2015; Kuchinke,
Võ, Hofmann, & Jacobs, 2007; Papesh & Goldinger, 2012).
Kuchinke et al. (2007) measured pupil dilation in high and
low frequency words and found that high frequency words
receive higher peak pupil dilation compared to low frequency
words. Papesh and Goldinger (2012) replicated the effect, using delayed naming paradigm. They delayed the time of the

Word Naming Experiment

They were asked to start speaking as soon as the word appeared on the screen. As participants were wearing a headmounted eye tracker, they were instructed to move their head
as little as possible.
Participants were seated in front of the computer screen
at a distance of approximately 60 cm. The experimenter
placed the headband of the eye tracker over participant’s head
and adjusted it such that the eye position could be correctly
tracked on the computer screen. Further, the eye tracking system was calibrated. Adjustments were made until the spacial
accuracy of the eye location measurement was smaller than
0.5 degrees of arc. The stimuli were presented on a 21-inch
Dell grey background computer screen in black lower case
26-point Courier New Bold font. The screen resolution was
1024x768 pixels.
Each trial started with a drift correction on the left of the
screen, after which the target appeared in the center. The target stayed on the screen for 1500 ms and was then replaced
by a fixation cross that remained on the screen for 2500 ms.
Thus, in total each trial lasted 4000 ms. We extended the
length of each trial to ensure that the pupil size was recorded
with enough time delay for the pupil to contract to the baseline. The experiment started with ten practice trials, which
were followed by the 400 experimental trials. Every 100th
trial was followed by a short break. At the end of the experiment participants filled out a language background questionnaire. The whole procedure lasted approximately 90 minutes.

Participants
Thirty-three native speakers of Estonian (18 women; 22-69
years; mean age 38), with normal or corrected to normal vision and no diagnosed speech impairments, participated in
the experiment. The participant’s dominant eye was tracked
(30 right eye, 3 left eye). Participants received 15 euros for
their participation.

Materials and Design

Figure 1: Outline of the experimental design.
A total of 2800 case-inflected nouns were randomly selected from the Balanced Corpus of Estonian. The frequency
distribution resembled the distribution of the complete corpus, and ranged between 1 and 1000 per million (mean
14.27). The length of stimuli varied between 2 and 19 characters (mean 7.88; sd 2.62 characters). Twenty-eight experimental lists were created from the randomized set of 2800
items, each with 400 words. To maximize the number of
items in the experiment, an overlapping design was used (see
Figure 1), with a 300-word overlap between successive lists.
A given word occurred four times in the experiment, once in
each of four lists.

Data Preparation and Analysis
Naming latency and articulation duration were calculated directly from the audio recordings using Matlab (version 8.5.0,
(MATLAB, 2015). Prior to the analysis, data for two participants were removed due to technical problems during tracking. Thus, the analysis was conducted on the data from 31
subjects.
Trials with misspoken stimuli, eye movement spikes and
saccades due to eye-blinks were removed from the analysis
using R (version 3.2.1, R Development Core Team, 2015,
6.3% of the trials).
The statistical analysis was performed with R (version
3.2.1, (R Development Core Team, 2015), using the mgcv
package, version 1.8.6 of 2015, for generalized additive
mixed regression (GAMM) modeling (Wood, 2006); see also
Baayen et al., 2016, for visualization, we made use of the itsadug package (version 1.0.1, van Rij, Baayen, Wieling, and
van Rijn (2015).
The dependent variable of interest was log-transformed
Pupil size, measured in the standard (arbitrary) units delivered by the eye tracking system. The main predictors were
Time in milliseconds and Frequency. Frequency was transformed to normality using the Johnson transformation (version 1.3, R package Johnson, Fernandez (2014)). Gaze coordinates (x- and y-axis position on the screen in pixels) were
added to account for changes in measured pupil size due to
the location on the screen.
For each participant, we fitted a separate GAMM to the 400

Apparatus
The experiment was conducted in a medium illuminated
sound-attenuated booth. Eye movements and pupil size were
recorded using the head-mounted EyeLink II eye tracker by
SR Research Ltd. EyeLink II is a video-based tracking system with a resolution of 500 Hz, ca 3.0 ms delay, and an average spacial accuracy of approximately 0.5 degrees of arc.
The naming data was recorded separately from the stimulus presentation program ExperimentBuilder by SR Research
with a Marantz PMD670 digital recorder, using a supercarioid condenser table top microphone by Beyerdynamic, placed
approximately 10 cm from the participant’s mouth.

Procedure
Participants were tested individually. First, they were familiarized with the procedure: reading aloud, as naturally as possible, words presented one by one on the computer screen.

time series of pupil dilation values (resulting in 31 models).
In addition to a general smooth for a subject’s pupil dilation
curve, we also included, for each word, a nonlinear random
effect curve in time, using shrunk factor smooths. The X and
Y coordinates of the fixation position were included as controls using a tensor product smooth, and as we anticipated the
effect of frequency to vary over time, we also included a tensor product smooth for frequency and time. The model was
checked for autocorrelation in the residual error, and an AR
(1) autocorrelation parameter was then added to the model to
remove, as far as possible, autocorrelative structure from the
residuals (see Baayen et al. (2016) for a detailed discussion).
In what follows, we first discuss the estimated pupil dilation functions for the ensemble of 31 subjects. We then
provide more details on three subject groups resulting from a
clustering analysis.

is declining instead of increasing from stimulus onset. Some
subjects again deviate from the general group pattern. For example, for subject s14 there is no peak after speech onset, but
the pupil stays at high plateau even after the articulation offset. Furthermore, pupil fluctuation patterns of subject s27 and
s29 are somewhat similar to the first group as also here two
clear pupil responses are present. However, for these subjects
the second peak is much smaller than the second peak in the
first group. Finally, unlike the first two groups, the relative
heights of the pupil maxima are quite diverse.
Other dilation curves. The last two groups obtained by
the hierarchical clustering technique clearly stand out from
the rest (see the last row in Figure 2: subject s10, s16 and
s17). Subject s10 and s16 start with a high pupil size, but
it declines significantly after the stimulus onset. The pupil
size increases also only a little after the articulation onset and
stays relatively constant without a clear second peak. Finally,
the last cluster only included subject s17. This subject seems
to be similar to the first group and also has an initial pupil
peak. However, like subject s10 and s16, this subject has no
clear second peak. Because the two last groups include only
three subjects, we excluded them from further group analysis.
In the present experiment, there are three key events to
which the pupil appears to be sensitive: the presentation of
the stimulus, the onset of articulation, and the offset of articulation. The first three groups show an increase in pupil size
around the onset of articulation. The first group also shows
an increase in pupil size after the word is presented, whereas
it is less so for the rest of the four groups. The difference between the second and third is group is that although for both a
second peak is present, subjects in the second group have an
increasing pupil size and subjects in the third group decreasing pupil size. Finally, subject s10, s16 and s17 (group 4 and
5) start with a decline in pupil size from stimulus onset and
show only a small increase at articulation onset.
The subjects-specific pupil dilation functions indicate that
even though participants engage in exactly the same task,
with exactly the same procedure, they apparently engage in
this task in cognitively significantly different ways. Subjects
who show little or no dilation following stimulus onset might
be experienced readers, and subjects who show a decreasing
pupil dilation function might be highly skilled talkers.
Next, we included a smooth for frequency and a tensor
product smooth for frequency and time to the GAMM model.
We compared the frequency effect differences between the
three largest subject groups.

Individual Patterns over Time
Figure 2 presents the estimated pupil dilation functions provided by GAMMs that focused on the main effect of time
(leaving out frequency as covariate). The x-axis represents
time and the y-axis presents pupil size. The stimulus was presented at time 0 ms, and a trial ended after 4000 ms. The first
black dotted vertical line in a panel represents the median onset of articulation and the second dotted line the median offset
of articulation.
Figure 2 shows that the relation between the Pupil size and
the Time differs substantially between subjects. The different
dilation functions fall into five groups, obtained with a divisive hierarchical clustering method using Manhattan distance
applied to the first three principal components of a principal
component analysis of the correlation matrix of the empirical
first derivative of the subject time smooths, and indicated by
different color coding.
Group 1. The first group is the largest (12 subjects: s02,
s04, s05, s07, s08, s09, s18, s19, s21, s26, s30 and s31). For
these subjects, the pupil dilation function shows a first peak
shortly after stimulus onset and a second peak at or shortly
after the onset of articulation. However, some subjects show
a slightly different pattern from this general trend. For subject s02, s21, s26 and s30 there is no clear first peak, and for
subject s04 and s09 the second peak much later after the onset
of articulation.
Group 2. The second group includes eight subjects (s03,
s11, s13, s15, s22, s25, s32, s33). Here only one clear pupil
response is visible, which occurs slightly after speech onset
and peaks after speech offset. Somewhat different are subject
s11 and s15 who also show a slight peak after stimulus onset.
However, the main difference is a well-differentiated initial
peak in the pupil dilation function which is present in group
1, but absent in group 2.
Group 3. The third group also includes eight subjects (s06,
s12, s14, s23, s24, s27, s28 and s29). Compared to the first
two groups, this group is more heterogeneous. Also here,
only one pupil peak is visible and it occurs after speech onset.
However, unlike in the second group, in this group pupil size

Frequency Effects in Subject Groups
Figure 3 presents the main partial effect of frequency (top
panels) and the way frequency over time modifies the pupil
dilation function for the three main subject groups (bottom
panels). As in Figure 2, the first vertical dotted line represents median articulation onset and the second line median
articulation offset. The frequency measure, normalized (and
thus centered), ranges from -2 to +3; pupil size was logtransformed.

Figure 2: The fitted effects of time smooths for 31 subjects, five groups are indicated by different color-coding. The first vertical
dotted line indicates the median articulation onset and the second dotted line the median articulation offset.
Group 1. The summary of the statistical model for the
first group indicated a significant main effect of Frequency
(t(898846)=-4.93; p-value < 0.0001). Pupil dilation decreases linearly with increasing frequency, which is consistent with high-frequency words being cognitively less demanding, typically affording shorter responses latencies in
the word naming task (Forster & Chambers, 1973).

words (see the peak around 0 ms and the yellow peak around
1500 ms in the bottom-left panel of Figure 3).
It is noteworthy that the effect of frequency on pupil size
is the largest for this group after speech offset. This can be
seen by considering the gradient before and after articulation.
Before articulation, we find three contour lines, after articulation, we find five. Even around 3000 ms after stimulus onset,
frequency still has a strong effect. This suggests the effect of
frequency is not restricted to the early stages of information
uptake, and is likely to have a strong semantic component.
Group 2. As the middle panels of Figure 3 show,
the second group has no main effect of Frequency (F(1,
578743.7)=1.17; p-value=0.28. However, the frequency and
time interaction is significant (F(15.034, 578743.7)= 9.90;
p-value < 0.0001). The contour lines in the bottom-middle
panel are all fairly vertical, indicating an effect of time and
hardly any modulation by frequency, except a weak effect before speech onset at high frequency range.
This pattern of results suggests that the second group might
not be semantically engaged. It is well known that experienced readers can read out text while thinking about other
issues. We suspect that the members of the second group are
rather ‘mechanically’ performing the task, but are not deeply
engaged in interpretation, possibly because isolated words in
a word naming experiment are out of context and have no
communicative value.
Group 3. This group also shows no significant main effect of Frequency (F(1.255, 591182.6)=8.95; p-value=0.42),
but a non-linear interaction (F(14.388, 591182.6)=7.52.; p-

Frequency entered into a significant nonlinear interaction
with time (F(14.02, 896425.4)=8.72; p-value < 0.0001). The
way in which frequency modulates the pupil dilation is presented in the bottom-left panel of Figure 3. The contour plot
can be read like a topographic map with peaks and valleys,
yellow indicates the highest and blue the lowest elevation.
The contour lines show the slope of the Pupil size as a function of Time and Frequency. The lines that are closely spaced
represent steep slope and contour lines further apart gentler
slopes, i.e., slower changes in Pupil size.
When the value on the y-axis is kept constant at zero, we
see a similar pattern to the simple time smooths for members of the first group in Figure 2. The pupil starts off with
a slight peak in pupil size shortly after the stimulus onset,
contracts before the articulation, dilates again during articulation and finally, contracts at the end of the trial. This is
color-coded by changes from green to yellow, from yellow to
green, from green back to yellow and from yellow back to
green and then blue. However, as we can also see, the pupil
dilation changes differently over time dependent on the frequency of the word. The pupil size increases earlier in time
and more with lower frequency words than higher frequency

The interaction effect of the third group is somewhat similar to the first group. However, compared to the first group,
the effect is more shallow and gradient in particular during
and after articulation. At stimulus onset, there is no frequency
effect, but there is a gradual decline in pupil size across frequency span until the speech onset. Further, compared to the
first group, we see fewer contour lines and a more gradual
change from yellow to green after the end of the articulation.
Also for this group the pupil dilation peak is weaker after
speech offset. The results suggests more engagement with
words compared to the second but less compared to the first
group.

Schlesewsky, Rösler, & Schlesewsky, 2007, for similar conclusions in EEG data). What this shows is either that different subjects engage in exactly the same task in very different
ways or that subjects are all engaged in exactly the same way,
but their engagement is manifested differently in their pupil
dilations. However, based on the group differences in frequency, we argue for the first option.
Given substantial variability in subjects’ reading abilities
(see e.g., Kuperman & Van Dyke, 2011), loquaciousness,
amount of education, social status and responsibilities, as
well as differences in age, gender, and motivation for participating in a psycholinguistic experiment, these differences
are perhaps unsurprising. But these differences clearly indicate that general statements about loci of processing effects
in the ‘population’ based on pupillometry data are potentially
hazardous, if the present pattern of results, revealed by detailed investigation with generalized additive mixed models,
turn out to be replicable in future experiments.

General Discussion
The results of this study can be summarized as follows. Inspection of the pupil dilation function for 31 participants revealed substantial variation in not only the magnitude of dilation in response to stimulus onset, speech onset, and articulation offset, but also in the direction of change, with some subjects showing contraction and others dilation. In the light of
such substantial inter-subject variability, it makes little sense
to try to extract a ‘population dilation curve’ from this kind
of data. Such a curve would not come close to characterizing
the pupil response function for many of the participants. This
seems to apply in particular to pupillometry data, but also
cognitive research in general (see e.g., Roehm, Bornkessel-

This conclusion is supported by an examination of the frequency effect of three subject groups. Two of these subject
groups (group 1 and 3) showed a frequency effect that was
the strongest after the offset of articulation. One of the groups
(group 1) also showed a weak frequency effect immediately
after stimulus onset. The second group showed only a weak
effect of frequency, even though the members of this group,
just as the others, read the words and produced them correctly.
The weak frequency effect, in combination with a relatively
shallow pupil response, may be indicative of short but se-

mantically shallow lexical processing (e.g., Baayen and Milin
(2010), who observed the absence of a word frequency effect
for fast readers, and the strongest effect of frequency for the
slowest readers in self-paced reading of continuous text).
We think that for a proper understanding of lexical processing, in all its currently bewildering variability, it will be
essential to consider in much more detail the vast differences
in experience, motivation, socio-cultural background, as well
as differences in brain morphology, that subjects bring into an
experiment.
