carried out on all 12 children from the Manchester corpus
(Theakston et al. 2001). Corpora for individual children
consist of 34 fortnightly recordings of interactions between
child and mother, starting at a child age of approximately 2
years. Recordings are transcribed and include a MOR tier,
which contains morphological coding, including Part of
Speech (PoS) information for individual words.
  For the current analysis, the MOR line was used to
identify nouns and main verbs in the child and maternal
speech. Noun richness was then expressed as the number of
nouns divided by the number of nouns plus verbs. The
analysis thus disregards function words and modal/auxiliary
verbs (which are frequently omitted by children), and
focuses on the two main classes of content words. Figure 1
presents the children’s and mothers’ noun richness scores.
