vergence occurs across racial lines, it is typically toward a
prestigious mainstream dialect, associated more with such
alienable traits as education, wealth and power than with race.
Cross-racial shifts towards local White or African American
dialect occur rarely, and usually in cases where the speaker in
question holds strong social ties with speakers of the relevant
dialect (Fix, 2010; Sweetland, 2002). Other cases involve
more temporary shifts in which features are appropriated, al-

sociation with urban Blackness, such as “coolness” (Ibrahim,
1999; Cutler, 1997), by speakers relatively well disposed to-
ward (their perception of) urban Black culture.
   A striking and unusual counterexample to this was re-
ported by Sneller (2014), who conducted fieldwork in which           Figure 1: Players randomly assigned to species. There were
