   Obtaining a better understanding of the specific cognitive
processes underlying performance on standard neuropsycho-
logical assessments, especially taking into account both quan-
titative and qualitative differences, provides value in under-
standing the basic science of cognition and development as
well as the interpretation of these assessments in practical set-
tings (Hunt, 1983; Kaplan, 1988; Keating & Bobbitt, 1978;
Mislevy & Verhelst, 1990; Sternberg, 1988). Computational

precision in the theory being tested. Royer has argued for in-
creased specificity in theories of block design performance
through conceptual information processing models (Royer,
1984), and having a working, runnable computational model
takes this desired level of specificity one step further.
   We propose a new computational architecture for model-

interplay between attention, perception, memory, and action.
We implemented this architecture using a custom block de-

            The Computational Architecture
 We designed the block design computational architecture to
 have six basic mechanisms, as shown in Fig. 3:
1. The visual perception module takes as input a visual
    scene representation from the simulation and outputs a new
    image at each time step, which we call the perceptual im-
    age. The content of this image varies depending on where
    the model is currently directing its gaze. The perceptual           Figure 3: The overall model architecture, including inputs

    Each of the two models applied a guided search strategy
to locate the blocks and used a visual similarity threshold of
0.95. (These two additional parameters are discussed in detail
in the next two experiments.) The gaze transition graphs for
each of these models are shown in Fig. 4.
