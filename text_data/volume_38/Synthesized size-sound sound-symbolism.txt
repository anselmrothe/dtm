   We wrote a Matlab script to generate all possible
combinations of words according to this pattern where the
consonant was not repeated (e.g. bobaboba), and this
resulted in 192 possible nonwords.

Three were discarded due to issues with the Presentation
script, leaving us with 30 participants in total. This sample
size is identical to Lockwood et al. (2016). However, the
reduction in the number of items to learn per condition
means that more participants are needed to match the power
of that study. Therefore, this experiment is intended as an
initial experiment to be replicated with a larger sample size.

Participants identified nonwords at 75.56% accuracy in the
match condition, at 66.11% accuracy in the neutral
condition, and at 62.50% accuracy in the mismatch
condition. This is shown in Figures 3 and 4. Error bars in
