Abstract
Studies of sound symbolism have shown that people can
associate sound and meaning in consistent ways when
presented with maximally contrastive stimulus pairs of
nonwords such as bouba/kiki (rounded/sharp) or mil/mal
(small/big). Recent work has shown the effect extends to
antonymic words from natural languages and has proposed a
role for shared cross-modal correspondences in biasing formto-meaning associations. An important open question is how
the associations work, and particularly what the role is of
sound-symbolic matches versus mismatches. We report on a
learning task designed to distinguish between three existing
theories by using a spectrum of sound-symbolically matching,
mismatching, and neutral (neither matching nor mismatching)
stimuli. Synthesized stimuli allow us to control for prosody,
and the inclusion of a neutral condition allows a direct test of
competing accounts. We find evidence for a sound-symbolic
match boost, but not for a mismatch difficulty compared to
the neutral condition.

Introduction
Research into iconicity, where aspects of a word's form
reflect aspects of its meaning, has considerably nuanced the
classical view of words as wholly arbitrary (Dingemanse,
Blasi, Lupyan, Christiansen, & Monaghan, 2015; Lockwood
& Dingemanse, 2015; Perniss, Thompson, & Vigliocco,
2010). Iconicity is found across languages, both spoken
(Dingemanse, 2012) and signed (Emmorey, 2014; Perniss &
Vigliocco, 2014), and plays a significant role in language
acquisition (Imai & Kita, 2014; Perry, Perlman, & Lupyan,
2015; Yoshida, 2012), language evolution (Cuskley &
Kirby, 2013; Verhoef, Kirby, & de Boer, 2015; Zlatev,
2014), and language processing (Lockwood & Tuomainen,
2015; Meteyard, Stoppard, Snudden, Cappa, & Vigliocco,
2015; Westbury, 2005); but it is still unclear exactly how.

Studies have shown that people are sensitive to the
meanings of sound-symbolic words in a foreign language,
associate certain artificial words (henceforth nonwords)
with certain properties depending on their vowels and
consonants, and learn new words better when there is a
sound-symbolic relationship between form and meaning
(Aveyard, 2012; Davis, 1961; Dingemanse, Schuerman,
Reinisch, Tufvesson, & Mitterer, in press; Kovic, Plunkett,
& Westermann, 2010; Lupyan & Casasanto, 2015). The
general consensus is that cross-modal correspondences and
perceptuo-motor analogies between sounds and meanings
provide a way of bridging the two domains in consistent
ways (Perniss & Vigliocco 2014). However, there is not yet
a satisfactory answer to which cross-modal correspondences
are implicated in sound symbolism or how exactly these
correspondences help people to make mappings. Many
experiments have relied on forced choice decisions where
participants judge which nonword goes with which property
(Bremner et al., 2013; Davis, 1961; Köhler, 1929; Nielsen
& Rendall, 2011, 2013; Sapir, 1929). This sets up a
paradigm where participants consistently identify soundsymbolically matching sets of stimuli (e.g. the nonword
bouba and the round shape, the nonword kiki and the spiky
shape). The combined weight of these experiments is an
affirmation of the existence and prevalence of sound
symbolism. However, these studies do not address how the
associations affect the participants' choices: does a soundsymbolic match provide a mapping boost helping the
participant to choose the matching set of stimuli, or does the
sound-symbolic mismatch provide a cue to exclude that set
of stimuli, or is it a combination of both? Moreover, it is not
always clear whether a mismatch is an actual clash or
whether mismatch is simply taken to mean "not matching".
Other experimental designs suggest that it is not as simple
as the two-alternative forced choice literature makes out
(Monaghan, Mattock, & Walker, 2012; Westbury, 2005).

Rating
experiments
which
vary
sound-symbolic
representations of size along a graded scale have shown that
people judge sound symbolism in a graded fashion rather
than simply as being there or not (Thompson & Estes,
2011). A graded model of sound symbolism is more
detailed, but leaves the same question open: is it driven
equally at both ends of the graded spectrum? Learning
experiments have shown that it may be one end of a graded
spectrum which drives sound-symbolic associations, such as
an association between labial sounds and roundness creating
an incidental association between non-labial sounds and
spikiness (Jones et al., 2014). While it appears that the
spiky—round spectrum does not map directly onto the
labial/voiced—non-labial/voiceless spectrum suggested by
two-alternative forced-choice studies, it remains to be seen
whether this imbalance holds for other domains. Finally,
other learning experiments suggest there is a soundsymbolic processing bias, but that it is weak and can be
overcome with training (Nielsen & Rendall, 2012).
We ran a similar learning experiment with Japanese
ideophones (Lockwood, Dingemanse, & Hagoort, 2016)
rather than nonwords. In this study, we taught the
ideophones to a group of Dutch participants with no
knowledge of Japanese. For half the ideophones, the
participants learned the real Dutch translations (e.g. dik, or
fat, for bukubuku, which means fat); for the other half, the
participants learned the opposite Dutch translations (e.g.
verdrietig, or sad, for ukiuki, which means happy). In a
recognition task, participants remembered the ideophones in
the real condition far better than the ideophones in the
opposite condition (86.1% recognition accuracy vs. 71.1%).
When we repeated the experiment with a set of arbitrary
adjectives and another group of participants, there was no
sound-symbolic effect across the two conditions (79.1%
recognition accuracy in the real adjective condition, 77% in
the opposite adjective condition). This is in line with the
nonword studies that show a mapping boost for soundsymbolically matching stimuli and a mapping difficulty for
sound-symbolically mismatching stimuli, although it is not
possible to say whether the effect is driven by one or both of
these mapping strategies.
In another sound symbolism study with real words,
Nygaard et al. (Nygaard, Cook, & Namy, 2009) found a
different result. Participants learned Japanese words with
their real translations and their opposite translations equally
well, but learned words with random translations less well.
They proposed that cross-modal correspondences help
sound-to-meaning mappings for both matching and
mismatching words, as antonym pairs are conceptually very
close. Under this interpretation, sound symbolism in
learning tasks is not a graded effect. Rather, the lack of any
sound-to-meaning correspondence makes word learning
harder than having a mismatching or counterintuitive crossmodal clash to build upon.
While using real words from real languages avoids the
ecological validity problem of nonwords, there are other
confounds which cannot be completely be ruled out. Firstly,

sound-symbolically congruent and incongruent prosody has
been shown to affect meaning judgement (Nygaard, Herold,
& Namy, 2009). It is possible that our Dutch participants
were just picking up on the prosody of the Japanese
ideophones rather than the sounds themselves. Secondly,
orthography is a constant confound in tasks with both
nonwords and real words (Cuskley, Simner, & Kirby, 2015).
This paper builds on Lockwood et al. (2016) by creating
nonwords in the shape of Japanese ideophones, synthesizing
the sound stimuli, and limiting the meanings to a simple size
contrast. This lets us investigate a spectrum of soundsymbolically matching, mismatching, and neutral stimuli.
Here, we take neutral to mean that a relation that is neither
an obvious match nor an obvious mismatch. The use of a
speech synthesizer to generate the sounds eliminates
possible prosodic differences which in natural speech may
indicate sound-symbolic contrasts (Dingemanse et al. in
press). Keeping translations to "big" and "small" lets us
work within a well-attested sound-symbolic framework
where participants' subjective ratings are constrained and
predictable.
Including a neutral condition while ensuring that the
mismatch condition is a cross-modal clash (rather than just a
lack of cross-modal correspondence) allows us to adjudicate
between different theoretical accounts for sound-symbolic
effects. If the participants learn matching nonwords better
than neutral nonwords, but there is no difference between
neutral and mismatching nonwords, this is evidence for a
sound-symbolic match boost as in Lockwood et al. (2016)
and Jones et al. (2014). If participants learn matching
nonwords better than neutral nonwords and neutral
nonwords better than mismatching nonwords, this is
evidence for a graded sound-symbolic rating effect as in
Nielsen and Rendall (2012) transferring to sound-symbolic
learning. Finally, if participants learn the neutral nonwords
worse than both the matching and mismatching nonwords,
this is evidence for cross-modal correspondences boosting
learning regardless of whether the associations correspond
or clash, as in Nygaard et al. (2009).

Methods
In the main experiment, 30 participants learned 36
nonwords in three learning rounds, and were tested
immediately afterwards. We first describe the stimuli design
and selection.

Stimuli design
We created nonwords in the CVCV-CVCV pattern found
in Japanese ideophones. These nonwords were deliberately
created in order to sound big, neutral, or small, based on
attested cross-modal correspondences between sound and
size. Big-sounding nonwords featured voiced stops and
mid/low back vowels. Small-sounding nonwords featured
voiceless stops and high front vowels. Neutral-sounding
nonwords featured mid-vowels, and had either all voiced, all
unvoiced, or a mix of voiced and unvoiced stops. Table 1

We wrote a Matlab script to generate all possible
combinations of words according to this pattern where the
consonant was not repeated (e.g. bobaboba), and this
resulted in 192 possible nonwords.
We then synthesized the nonwords using the Dutch voice
nl2 from the diphone synthesizer MBROLA (Dutoit, Pagel,
Pierret, Bataille, & van der Vrecken, 1996). All nonwords
were given the same pitch, vowel durations, and prosodic
contours.
Figure 1: Size ratings per condition

Stimuli rating pre-test
28 native Dutch speakers listened to each synthesized
nonword under the impression that they were size adjectives
from a real language. Participants rated how big the word
sounded on a Likert scale of 1-7, where 1 represented really
small, 4 neutral, and 7 really big. Participants were also told
to indicate whether their rating was influenced by a similarsounding Dutch word in order to detect lexical confounds.
We removed 17 nonwords where at least four participants
indicated that it reminded them of something.
In the remaining 175 nonwords, participants consistently
judged the big-sounding words as big (mean=5.57), the
neutral-sounding words as neutral (mean=3.90), and the
small-sounding words as small (mean=2.68). This was a
highly significant effect according to a one-way ANOVA
(F=694.3, p<0.001), and post-hoc Bonferroni tests showed
that this difference was significant between each condition
(all ps <0.001). This is shown in Figure 1.
We selected 36 nonwords for the full experiment
according to their mean ratings. For the big-sounding
nonwords, we chose the 12 highest-rated nonwords; for the
small-sounding nonwords, we chose the 12 lowest-rated
nonwords; and for the neutral-sounding nonwords, we chose
the 12 nonwords which were rated most closely to 4. All 36
nonwords were from the originally designated condition,
i.e., all 12 big nonwords were nonwords which we designed
to sound big, and so on.
All nonwords meant either groot (big) or klein (small).
This set up three conditions: nonwords that meant big (or
small) and sounded big (or small) were sound-symbolically
matching, nonwords that meant big (or small) but sounded
small (or big) were sound-symbolically mismatching, and
nonwords that meant big or small but neither obviously
matching nor mismatched were neutral. This is illustrated
in Table 2. Correspondences between onsets in the

Main experiment
Participants had three learning rounds in which to learn
the nonwords, and then a test round immediately afterwards.
They were told that the words came from an African
language with a complicated adjective agreement system; in
a post-experiment debriefing they were informed that the
words
were
artificial.

were
counterbalanced across participants. The procedure is
illustrated in Figure 2.
We used Presentation to present the stimuli and record
responses. In the learning round, the initial Dutch word was
presented for 1000ms with 100ms of jitter, followed by a
fixation cross for 1000ms with 100ms of jitter. As the
nonword was played over the speakers, a blank screen was
presented for 2000ms with 200ms of jitter. This was again
followed by a fixation cross. The final screen with the
nonword and its Dutch meaning was presented until
participants were happy to move onto the next item.
Between trials, a blank screen was presented, followed by a
fixation cross to announce the beginning of the next trial.
Timings in the test round were identical, except that a
question mark was presented instead of a blank screen while
the nonword played. Participants responded by button press
for yes/no answers.

Figure 2: Learning and test round procedures.
Figure 3: test round results per participant
We tested 33 native Dutch speaking participants (4m, 29f)
aged 18-26 (mean: 21y 4m) with normal or corrected-tonormal vision, recruited from the MPI participant database.
Three were discarded due to issues with the Presentation
script, leaving us with 30 participants in total. This sample
size is identical to Lockwood et al. (2016). However, the
reduction in the number of items to learn per condition
means that more participants are needed to match the power
of that study. Therefore, this experiment is intended as an
initial experiment to be replicated with a larger sample size.

Results
Participants identified nonwords at 75.56% accuracy in the
match condition, at 66.11% accuracy in the neutral
condition, and at 62.50% accuracy in the mismatch
condition. This is shown in Figures 3 and 4. Error bars in
Figure 4 represent standard error. Mean accuracy was
consistent across antonym meanings (match: big = 74.44%,
small = 76.67%; neutral: big = 70.56%, small = 61.67%;
mismatch: big = 63.89%, small = 61.11%. All ps>0.1).
As the dependent variable was binary—correct or
incorrect—we analyzed the responses using a mixed-effects
logit model with the glmer function of the lme4 (versions
1.1-8) package in R. The data was modelled by including a
per-participant and per-nonword random adjustment to the
fixed intercept with a random slope for the fixed effect by
participant. The condition was sum contrast coded to
compare match to neutral and neutral to mismatch.
Model comparison between a model with condition as a
fixed effect and a model with no fixed effect showed that
condition was a significant fixed effect (χ2=8.36, p=0.015).
Secondly, the best model included a fixed effect of
condition, a random effect by participant with random
intercepts and random slopes by condition, and random
intercept by nonword. This model showed that participants
did better in the match condition than the neutral condition
(β=0.48, SE=0.20, p=0.017), but found no evidence for a

Discussion
Sound symbolism research has shown that cross-modal
correspondences help people make mappings between
sound and meaning. However, it is unclear whether this is
because cross-modal correspondences provide a mapping
boost or because a lack of a correspondence causes a
mapping difficulty. In this study, we build on previous
sound-symbolic word learning research by explicitly
controlling the type of sound-symbolic relationship in each
condition. Participants learned nonwords which had a
variety of sound-symbolic cues to help scaffold word
learning. Nonwords in the match condition had cross-modal
correspondences between their sounds and meaning;
nonwords in the mismatch condition had cross-modal
clashes between their sounds and meaning; and nonwords in
the neutral condition had neither matching nor mismatching
cross-modal information.

1826

Participants learned the nonwords in the match condition
better than the nonwords in the neutral condition, but there
was no difference in participants' performance in the neutral
and mismatch conditions, and nor was there any difference
between how well participants learned nonwords meaning
big and small. This suggests that sound-symbolic effects in
learning, and perhaps other behavioural tasks, are due to
cross-modal correspondences providing a mapping boost. It
also suggests that cross-modal mismatches do not provide a
mapping boost, but nor do they provide an increased
mapping difficulty (although mean scores suggest a possible
graded effect, which will be examined in a replication with a
larger sample size). This provides initial support for
Lockwood et al. (2016), Jones et al. (2014), and Imai et al.
(2014; Imai, Kita, Nagumo, & Okada, 2008), whose
learning experiments have previously suggested that soundsymbolic bootstrapping depends on the boost effect from
matching cross-modal correspondences. It also suggests that
the graded perception of sound symbolism in rating tasks
(such as in Nielsen & Rendall, 2011; Thompson & Estes,
2011, and indeed, the stimuli selection pre-test for this
study) does not extend to a graded learning effect. Finally, it
provides some evidence against the proposal that any kind
of cross-modal associations, corresponding or clashing, are
better for facilitating sound-symbolic mappings than no
cross-modal associations at all. However, this does not rule
out the findings of Nygaard et al. (2009). In their
experiments, the learning phase was far longer and
continued until participants reached a ceiling effect in their
accuracy responses. It is possible that there is an initial
sound-symbolic match boost during the first stages of word
learning, while any kind of cross-modal association can help
scaffold word learning during later stages of learning and
consolidation.
A replication of this study with a larger sample size will
provide further evidence of whether sound symbolism
boosts word learning through cross-modal correspondences
rather than other factors. Moreover, it will allow us to
explore individual differences in sound symbolism during
learning. This study shows that participants learned the
matching nonwords better than the neutral nonwords, while
there was no evidence for a difference in how well the
participants learned neutral and mismatching nonwords.
This is most obviously shown in Figure 4. However, the
dotplots in Figure 3 suggest that it may not quite be so
simple. Participants appear to be split, where approximately
half learn the neutral nonwords better than the mismatching
nonwords, and approximately half learn the mismatching
nonwords better than the neutral nonwords. It is possible
that some participants learn words better when there is a
cross-modal association between sound and meaning,
whether corresponding or clashing, while other participants
learn in a way that reflects the graded effect of soundsymbolic perception. A larger sample size in a follow-up
replication can explore these individual differences fully.
Finally, this study only addressed size symbolism for
consonant voicing and vowel position, and we cannot

assume that sound symbolism works this way for all formmeaning mappings.
In summary, we conducted a learning task equally
inspired by findings from natural language iconicity and
nonword studies. Using synthesized words in a constrained
semantic space allowed us to adjudicate between different
proposals about how sound symbolism affects learning. The
evidence points to a match boost but not a mismatch
difficulty,
clarifying
the
role
of
cross-modal
correspondences in sound-symbolic word learning.
