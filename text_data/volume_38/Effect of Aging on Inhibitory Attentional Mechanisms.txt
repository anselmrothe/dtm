dependent variable. There was a marginal main effect for
age [F(1, 64) = 3.35, p = 0.07], suggesting that older adults
recognized fewer words on the surprise recognition test
compared to young adults. There was no main effect for
target alignment indicating that overall TA word recognition
(M = 0.35, SE = 0.030) was not significantly lower than NA
(M = 0.40, SE = 0.026) [F(1, 64) = 1.75, p = 0.190], and no
interaction [F(1, 64) = 0.495, p = 0.485] (see Figure 2).
   Although an interaction was not observed, in order to
assess any possible influence of age on later surprise
recognition rates pre-planned t-tests were conducted on
accuracy performance for each age group.
