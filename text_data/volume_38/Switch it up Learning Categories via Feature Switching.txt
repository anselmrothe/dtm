                          Introduction
In light of recent work establishing the effects of category use
on conceptual representation, it has been argued that study-
ing human category learning solely through the traditional
artificial classification learning (TACL) paradigm provides a
limited view of the processes involved (Chin-Parker & Ross,
2002; Levering & Kurtz, 2015; Love, 2002; Yamauchi &
                                                                        Figure 1: The DIVA model architecture with two possible
