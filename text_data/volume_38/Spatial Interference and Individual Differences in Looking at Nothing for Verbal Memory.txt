We began by investigating whether there was a difference

cue conditions during the retrieval phase. Dwell time
percentages allocated to three irrelevant quadrants were
averaged into one irrelevant quadrant and analysed against
the relevant quadrant across the three different cue
conditions. A mixed analysis of variance showed a main

F2(2, 573) = 2.89, p = .06, 𝜂"# = .01. Paired t-tests revealed
that participants looked significantly longer at the relevant
quadrant than the average of three irrelevant quadrants
when retrieving the probe word in all conditions together
and in the valid cue condition (see Table 1).
