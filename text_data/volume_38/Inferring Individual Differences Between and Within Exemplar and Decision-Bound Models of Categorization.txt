Abstract
Different models of categorization are often treated as competing accounts, but specific models are often used to understand
individual differences, by estimating individual-level parameters. We develop an approach to understanding categorization that allows for individual differences both between and
within models, using two prominent categorization models that
make different theoretical assumptions: the Generalized Context Model (GCM) and General Recognition Theory (GRT).
We develop a latent-mixture model for inferring whether an
individual uses the GCM or GRT, while simultaneously allowing for the use of special-case simpler strategies. The GCM
simple strategies involve attending to a single stimulus dimension, while the GRT simple strategies involve using unidimensional decision bounds. Our model also allows for simple contaminant strategies. We apply the model to four previously
published categorization experiments, finding large and interpretable individual differences in the use of both models and
specific strategies, depending on the nature of the stimuli and
category structures.

Introduction
The ability to categorize is widely regarded as a cornerstone
of cognition (Murphy, 2002). It allows people to use innate or learned concepts to give meaning to stimuli, and provides a basis for the key cognitive capabilities of generalization and prediction. Existing theories of categorization
vary in their assumptions about how people represent categories, and make decisions when categorizing stimuli. Accordingly, there are many different formal models of categorization, including prototype, exemplar, decision-bound,
and rule-based models, as well as various hybrid models
(Kruschke, 2008). Hybrid models involve representational
assumptions that combine two or more approaches such as
prototype with exemplar, or exemplar with rule-based representations.
A prominent exemplar model is the Generalized Context
Model (GCM: Nosofsky, 1986), which assumes people store
exemplars of each category in memory, attend to the relevant dimensions of the stimuli, and categorize a stimulus
using similarity-based generalization from these exemplars.
A prominent decision-bound model is General Recognition
Theory (GRT: Ashby & Townsend, 1986), which assumes
that people use a decision bound to partition the stimuli into
discrete categories. Categorization seems likely to depend
heavily on psychological components and processes such
as memory capacity, attentional control, decision-making
biases, and so on, all of which may vary across people.

Accordingly, it seems reasonable to expect meaningful individual differences in categorization, and this expectation
is supported by model-based and empirical evidence (e.g.,
Bartlema, Lee, Wetzels, & Vanpaemel, 2014; Soto, Vucovich,
Musgrave, & Ashby, 2015). Previous work has studied different types of strategies within models like the GCM and
GRT. For example, previous GRT modeling has emphasized
the possibility that different people might use different decision bounds, including special cases like unidimensional horizontal or vertical bounds (Ashby & Gott, 1988; Maddox &
Ashby, 1993).
In this paper, we present an approach to inferring the general models and specific strategies people use in categorization tasks. We do this by allowing for individual differences
between the GCM and GRT models, and for individual differences in specific strategies, like unidimensional bounds, possible within each model. We develop a latent-mixture modeling approach that infers the model and strategy each person
is using. Building on previous work in which both the GCM
and GRT have been implemented as Bayesian graphical models (Lee & Wagenmakers, 2013; Danileiko, Lee, & Kalish,
2015), we implement our latent-mixture approach also as a
graphical model, allowing for fully Bayesian inference. We
apply our model to four existing categorization experiments–
all involving stimuli that can be represented in terms of two
underlying psychological dimensions–but with various types
of stimuli and category structures. We find evidence for large
individual differences both between and within models. We
finish by discussing the implication of our model and results
for future research in understanding how people represent categories.

Latent-Mixture Model
Our latent-mixture approach assumes that each subject uses
one categorization model or specific strategy within that
model, and that the overall data set is therefore a mixture of
these specific components. We also allow for the possibility of contaminant subjects, who are guessing or repetitively
assigning stimuli to the same category. Instead of filtering
these people out, we model the contaminant behavior as another mixture component (Zeigenfuse & Lee, 2010).
Figure 1 presents a schematic graphical model that summarizes our approach. Each subject’s categorization data y is
generated by either the GCM, GRT, or a contaminant process.
Within each of these general models, there are specific possibilities. For the GCM, either the original model with general

stimulus i is equal to θGCM = ∑ j∈C j ηi j / ∑m
K=1 (∑k∈CK ηik ).
In the full GCM, selective attention can range between 0
and 1. The special cases of w = 0 and w = 1 correspond to
attending to just one of the two stimulus dimensions, and constitute theoretically interesting strategies. For example, if one
stimulus dimension is shape and the other is color, one person
might attend only to the shape dimension and place circles in
one category and squares in the other. However, another person might attend only to the color dimension and place red
shapes in one category and blue shapes in the other. A third
person might attend to both dimensions and categorize red
circles separately from blue squares. These possibilities correspond to the three GCM components included in our model,
represented by the w = 0, w = 1, and w nodes respectively.

categorization process generates the observed behavior of

involving the nature of selective attention, the decision bound,
or the contaminant response probabilities are considered.

selective attention w is used, or attention is focused on only
one of the stimulus dimensions, w = 0 or w = 1. For the GRT,
either a general diagonal bound is used αD , βD , or unidimensional horizontal βH or vertical βV bounds are used. For the
contaminant processes, either a category is repeatedly chosen
θR or a guess is made on each trial θG .

GCM and Strategies
The GCM is an exemplar model that assumes people store
all stimuli in memory and categorize a new stimulus by comparing it the stored stimuli. It is based on a similarity comparison between the presented stimulus and every other stimulus, using the concept of psychological distance (Shepard,
1957). If the stimuli are points in a two-dimensional coordinate space, psychological distance is defined as di j =
1
[∑Nk=1 wk |xik − x jk |r ] r , where xik is the value of coordinate
point xi on dimension k, N is the number of dimensions, and
r is either equal to 1 or 2 for separable-dimension or integraldimension stimuli, respectively. The selective attention parameter w controls the level of attention given to one stimulus dimension. The distance is used to calculate the similarity ηi j = (e−cdi j )γ so as the distance between points gets
larger, their perceived similarity decreases exponentially. The
generalization parameter c controls the steepness of the generalization gradient. The response determinism parameter γk
controls probabilistic or deterministic responding (Ashby &
Maddox, 1993). The final probability based on these processes can be affected by the bias toward each category. In
our implementation, we assume there is no bias, and so set
b = 21 . This means that the probability of responding J to

The GRT model assumes that instead of storing each stimulus
in memory, people partition the stimulus space into response
regions divided by boundaries. Response probabilities are determined by these decision bounds, based on which region a
noisy perception of the presented stimulus, x pi = xi + ε p , belongs. Our model considers only linear decision bounds, although quadratic bounds have also been considered in the literature (Ashby & Maddox, 1992). A linear bound is defined
as a discriminant function of the two dimensions satisfying
the implicit line equation h(x1 , x2 ) = b1 x1 + b2 x2 + c.
GRT assumes that there is variability in people’s memory
of the location of the bound. To account for this, the function
is adjusted to include criterial noise εc . The function is compared to a bias parameter δ which captures bias toward a category. If h(x pi ) + εc is smaller than δ, the response is category
A. If it is larger than δ, the response is category B. If it is equal
to δ, the response will be a guess between A and B. We again
assumed no bias so that δ = 0. Thus, the probability of a category A decision for stimulus i is θGRT = P(h(x pi ) + εc < 0).
Special cases of the general GRT model that have previously been emphasized involve unidimensional boundaries
corresponding to vertical or horizontal lines. A vertical strategy is defined by an intercept value βV , a horizontal strategy is defined by an intercept value, βH , and a general diagonal boundary is defined by a slope and intercept αD and βD .
These possibilities correspond to the three GRT components
included in our model. Although the vertical and horizontal strategies can be viewed as special cases of the diagonal
strategy, one way to think about this in the latent-mixture approach is as a single model with a theoretically-rich prior. Including the vertical and horizontal boundaries as special cases
corresponds to considering only a diagonal boundary with a
prior that places significant density on boundaries with infinite and zero slope.

Contaminant Strategies
The three GCM strategies and the three GRT strategies make
up six mixture components in our model. The remaining
components capture contaminant subjects. In these cases,
the probability values θcont do not follow from a theoretical

2826

model, but are set directly. For guessing, the response probability is θG = 0.5, so that each category response is equally
likely on every trial. For a repetitive contaminant behavior,
G
the probability of a category A response is either θA = 0.99 or
G
θB = 0.01, depending on which category choice is repeated.
Adding these three contaminant possibilities leads to a total of
nine components of our latent mixture model, with Figure 1
combining the two repeated contaminant possibilities.

Modeling Results
We implemented the graphical model in JAGS (Plummer,
2003), and used fully Bayesian methods based on MCMC
sampling to make inferences.1 Advantage of this methodological approach include accounting coherently for uncertainty about inferences, both in terms of model use and
model-specifc parameters, and automatically controlling for
the different complexity of the models and strategies considered (Lee & Wagenmakers, 2013).
We applied the model to four previously published categorization experiments. These experiments all involved a series of trials in which subjects viewed a stimulus and placed
it into one of two categories, with corrective feedback after
each trial. The stimuli used varied across experiments and include rectangles varying in size and interior line segment position (Kruschke, 1993), Shepard circles varying in size and
radial lines (Bartlema et al., 2014), Gabor patches varying
in frequency and orientation (Zeithamova & Maddox, 2006),
and faces (Navarro, Lee, & Nikkerud, 2005). For the first
three, there is a natural two-dimensional stimulus representation. For the faces, we assumed a two-dimensional representation based on multidimensional scaling modeling (Okada &
Lee, 2016). Details of the experiments, including the number
of subjects, blocks, nature of the experiment, and the various
conditions, are presented in Table 2. The code for the graphical model, categorization data, detailed analysis of every subject in every experiment and condition, and other supplementary material is available on the Open Science Framework
project page for this paper at https://osf.io/ckwsn/.

Overall Results
Table 1 summarizes our results by listing how many people
are inferred most likely be using each of the possible models
and strategies. The individual model-use inferences come are
seen in the indicator variable in the JAGS code that assumes a
uniform prior over all nine potential models, meaning that in
the prior, each person is equally likely to use any of the nine.
The “most likely” model for each person is taken from the
posterior distribution of the indicator variable. There are four
conditions in the Kruschke (1993) experiment: the first two
are filtration category structures, in which the stimuli can be
categorized correctly by using information from only one dimension, and the second two are condensation category struc1 Our results are based on 3 independent chains with 100 samples
each, collected after discarding the first 500 burn-in ones from each
chain, and testing for convergence using the standard R̂ statistic.

tures, in which the stimuli can only be categorized correctly
by using information from both dimensions. The majority of
the 160 participants are inferred to use the GCM exemplar
approach, but the specific selective attention strategy varies
by condition. The Bartlema et al. (2014) experiment has two
conditions, named after the category structures, both of which
require information from both stimulus dimensions for correct categorization. The majority of the 65 participants use
a decision bound approach. The Zeithamova and Maddox
(2006) experiment has four conditions. The unidimensional
condition is similar to the filtration condition in the Kruschke
experiment and the information-integration condition is similar to the condensation condition. The “+ load” label in Table 1 indicates that that condition also involved a simultaneous working memory load task. The majority of the 170 participants use the decision-bound approach, with the vertical
strategy being most common. This experiment involves the
most contaminant subjects, who are inferred primarily to be
guessing. The Navarro et al. (2005) experiment has four conditions. These involved categorizing faces based on gender,
hair color, perceived level of trust, and a random condition
with no logical structure. The majority of the 40 subjects use
an exemplar approach, with selective attention that considers
both available dimensions, but there is large individual variation over both models and strategies across the conditions.
Kruschke (1993) Results The results from the Kruschke
(1993) experiment are shown at an individual level, for selected subjects, in Figure 2. The circles show the eight stimuli. The dark-colored circles show a response of category A
while the light-colored circles show a response of category
B. The size of the circle shows the number out of the total
number of trials that each stimulus was placed in either category. The smallest circle means that stimulus was placed into
that category exactly half of the time while the largest circle
means that stimulus was placed into that category all the time.
The bar graphs on the top of each panel show the uncertainty
in the inference about which model and strategy the subject
used. Each bar shows the posterior probability for a model or
strategy. A tall bar showing one strategy means that we can
be more certain of that person’s inferred strategy than when
there are shorter bars showing many strategies. The text at the
bottom right corner of each panel indicates the inferred most
likely strategy. For the general GCM w strategy, the 95%
credible intervals and posterior mean for w are listed. For
the GRT possibilities, the bound corresponding to the posterior mean is shown as a thick line, and the upper and lower
bounds f to the 95% credible intervals are shown as thin lines.

value close to w = 0.5 in one case, and w = 0.83 in the other.

Bartlema et al. (2014) Results The results from the
Bartlema et al. (2014) experiment are shown at an individual
level in Figure 3. The top panels come from the diagonal condition and the bottom panels come from the criss-cross condition. The top-left subject is inferred to be using a horizontal
boundary, but with some uncertainty about the possible use of
a more general diagonal boundary. The bottom-left subject is
also inferred to be using a horizontal boundary, but there is a
possibility of a diagonal boundary, or a contaminant guessing
strategy. The top-right subject is inferred to be using a diagonal boundary, with greater uncertainty. The bottom-right
subject is inferred to be using a vertical boundary, also with a
high level of certainty.
Zeithamova and Maddox (2006) Results The results from
the Zeithamova and Maddox (2006) experiment are shown at
an individual level in Figure 4. The top-left subject comes
from the unidimensional condition. The top-middle and topright subjects come from the unidimensional + load condition. The bottom-left subject come from the informationintegration condition. The bottom-middle and bottom right
subjects come from the information-integration + load condition. In this experiment, very few of the subjects were in-

ferred to be using an exemplar strategy, perhaps as a result
of the large number of stimuli required to keep in memory.
Even though most subjects were inferred to be using a decision bound, there is still great variation in the specific shape
of the boundaries, with varying slopes and intercepts. Two
of the subjects selected for Figure 4 are inferred to be using
a vertical boundary, even though they come from conditions
with different category structures. Similarly, two of the subjects are inferred to be using a diagonal boundary, but one
with more uncertainty than the other about the location of the
boundary. This experiment also involved a large number of
subjects inferred to be contaminants, one of whom is shown
in Figure 4. The top-right panel shows one subject who was
inferred to be using an exemplar approach with a w=1 strategy, although there is large uncertainty about this inference,
consistent with the poor categorization performance shown.

dition, the top-middle and top-right subjects come from the
hair-color condition, the bottom-left subject comes from the
trust condition, and the bottom-middle and bottom-right subjects come from the random condition. Most of the subjects
are inferred to be using the GCM, perhaps as a result of the
stimuli being faces and not easily separable into psychologically interpretable dimensions. Two of the selected subjects
are inferred to be using the general GCM w strategy, with
varying mean values depending on the condition. A few subjects are inferred, with less certainty, to be using a decisionbound approach. The random condition has the most contaminants, as for the subject in the bottom-right panel, typically

differences for more complicated real-world stimuli, such as
faces, with the goal of understanding how people categorize
in everyday life. It is straightforward to extend our model to
include other theoretical accounts of categorization behavior,
and different specific strategies within them. These could incorporate other categorization models, such as hybrid models
that combine prototype with exemplar or rule-based representations. It would also be possible to extend the model to allow
for shifts in categorization within an individual, allowing for
possibilities like rapid shifts in attention, or the adaptation of
an overly simple unidimensional bound to a more general diagonal bound on the basis of feedback. Examination of the
strategy shifts that occur can be useful for further predictive modeling of when we can expect participants to switch
strategies. Collectively, these extensions allow for broader
and deeper investigation of the individual differences in the
way people represent and use categories.

Discussion
We have presented a latent-mixture model that infers which
of the two models—the GCM or the GRT—each person is using, and whether they are using a specific strategy within that
model. Our individual differences analysis showed that different people’s categorization behavior can best be explained
by different model strategies, depending on the types and
number of stimuli involved, and the nature of the category
structures. Instead of continuing a debate of a “one model
fits all” answer where all behavioral data must be in accordance with one type of model, applications of our modeling approach to individual subject data can potentially reveal
multiple models and strategies being used by different people.
Future work could apply our general method, and the specific model we have implemented and demonstrated, to other
categorization experiments, exploring how individual differences change with the type of stimuli and category structures
involves. It would be interesting to understand individual
