have access to through our sensory systems. For this reason,
humans may naturally attend more to to ∆ scores; making
r∆Cont a better model of human learning than rStates.
Continuous vs. Binary Representation
A question raised above is how a learner could compute a
correlation between two variables when it would require
remembering all the values of X and Y as well as
computationally integrating all those values; r∆Cont would be
just as challenging to compute as rStates. Earlier, we proposed            Figure 3: Stimuli viewed by subjects. Two consecutive
