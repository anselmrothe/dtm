colour (i.e., colour 2) in colour context. The plot on the top
left shows that in the motion context, the model makes very
few choices towards right for negative values of the motion

with an increase in the motion coherence, and is highest when
the motion coherence takes its maximum positive value (re-

The plot on the top right shows that the colour coherence does
not have much effect on the choices in motion context. Over-
all, the two plots show that in the motion context, the choices
of the model depend strongly on motion coherence of the dots
whereas they depend only weakly on colour coherence. The
