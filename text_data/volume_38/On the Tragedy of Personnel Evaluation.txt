   First they had to choose which of the five workers was of

had to choose intuitively. Second, they chose which person
represented the lowest utility for the business. Third, they
ranked employees according to “their total utility for the
company in the present setting” (not reported here). Fourth,
they rated the earnings of the five workers (presented
randomly) on a scale of 1 to 10.
