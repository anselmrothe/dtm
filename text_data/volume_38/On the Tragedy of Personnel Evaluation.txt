In social-dilemma situations (public-good games) people may
pursue their local, egoistic interests and thereby lower the
global, overall payoff of their group and, paradoxically, even
their own resulting payoff. One may also speak of intraindividual dilemmas, where people pursue local goals at the
expense of their overall utility. Our current experiments
transfer this idea to the context of personnel evaluation and
personnel selection. In our experiments, participants were put
in the position of a Human Resources manager, who should
for instance select workers who optimize the overall payoff of
the company, rather than those who optimize only their
specific payoffs. The results of the experiments, however,
suggest that most, albeit not all, participants tended to focus
on directly comparing individuals without considering the
overall contribution to a group. Thus employees with the best
overall effects for a company or organization may be
evaluated the most negatively. This possible ‘tragedy of
personnel evaluation’ may be linked to maladaptive incentive
structures (personnel evaluation), advancement of employees
(personnel promotion) and job offers (personnel selection),
and may have a substantial negative impact on the
effectiveness of companies or organizations.

possible solutions of the perhaps not always inevitable
tragedies. Moreover, the debates have eroded the explicit or
tacit strict egoism assumption without ignoring the limits of
altruism (e.g., Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003, 2004; Fehr &
Schmidt, 1999; Fehr & Gächter, 2002; Henrich, 2005;
Ostrom et al., 1999). Likewise, evolutionary biology in
recent decades has shifted from an emphasis on individual
egoism (or gene-egoism) to an acknowledgement of multilevel approaches that generally suggests one should find
egoistic as well as altruistic behaviour tendencies in social
groups (Nowak & Sigmund, 2005; Sober & Wilson, 1999;
Wilson & Wilson, 2007; cf. von Sydow, 2011).
In organizations it is also plausible, then, that each
member frequently faces tension between egoistic and
group-serving behaviours. The issue is not constrained to
moral questions of pursuing the common good of a society,
but arises within companies, for managers and workers
alike, even when they merely aim to optimize certain
economic key figures (e.g., net sales or operating profit).
Solving such intra-organizational dilemmas, therefore, is
one of the most crucial tasks of building efficient systems of
co-operation.
One obvious potential solution of inner-organizational
dilemmas seems to install an institutionalized, neutral thirdparty that tries to access justly the contributions of egoistic
versus group-serving individuals. This seems linked to good
leadership or should at least be a major concern of management control systems or Human Resources managers.
Yet do people really have the capacity for “altruist
detection” or “egoist detection”?
First, one must concede that basic biological multi-level
models of group altruism do not necessarily require the
ability of organisms to detect altruist or egoists (Sober &
Wilson, 1999; Wilson & Wilson, 2007). However, there are
refined models that refer to such abilities, can be
evolutionary stable without necessitating cultural transmission (Nowak & Sigmund, 2005). Thus it seems implausible
to deny a general ability of altruist detection in humans.
Second, a prima facie potential for egoist or altruist
detection – or, put more cautiously, of co-operator and
cheater detection – seems quite plausible (at least for human
beings) if we consider the importance of the topics in daily
contexts. One might object that, in times when multi-level
models had a bad standing in evolutionary biology, there
was likewise psychological evidence in simple rule-testing
tasks (Wason Selection Tasks) that people are only

Inner-Organizational Dilemmas
Adam Smith (1776) famously argued that no altruism is
needed to promote the common good: “By pursuing his own
interest he [the individual] frequently promotes that of the
society more effectually than when he really intends to
promote it.”
In contrast, in the wider context of evolutionary biology,
economics and psychology, it has long been noted that
social dilemma situations often arise when groups of
organisms or human agents act ‘optimally’ – in the sense of
pursuing their egoistic interests only. People in such
situations may often behave contrary to the best interest of
the whole, which paradoxically often results in disastrous
outcomes for each individual as well. For instance, it has
been argued that the over-exploitation and destruction of
finite public resources by ‘rationally’ acting, selfish
individuals is inevitable. This has been called the “tragedy
of the commons” and has been discussed with regard to
environmental pollution and sustainable development
(Hardin, 1968). Social dilemmas have widely been studied,
theoretically and empirically, in psychology and behavioural
economics. Recent decades have yielded lively debate of

105

successful at detecting cheaters but not co-operators or
altruists (Cosmides, 1989). However, further research has
suggested that this greater facility for cheater-detection
depends on the question asked and the goals pursued (von
Sydow, 2006; von Sydow & Hagmayer, 2006).
Third, in the specific context of our experiments on
Human Resources management and personnel evaluation, it
seems even clearer, at least from first sight, that people in
management roles should be able roughly to discern who
contributed the most to a company’s success (if provided
appropriate quantitative information). One reason is that,
from the vantage point of game-theoretical analysis, the
social dilemma becomes an “intra-individual dilemma”
(von Sydow, 2015) that is normatively to be solved
globally; the personnel manager should at least normatively
optimize globally and refrain from selecting or rewarding
employees with good individual operating figures over those
who overall best serve the interests of the work group,
company or organization. However, even for intraindividual dilemmas, it has been shown that people may
optimize locally, at the expense of the global level (von
Sydow, 2014). For instance, an individual may pursue too
many projects, each with a positive utility, but may thereby
reduce overall utility by ignoring those projects’ negative
external effects on other projects. Transferring the idea that
people may often not realize or acknowledge the positive
externalities if local effects, may in the context of a human
recource management task imply that people may ignore
interactions with other employees or the distributed indirect
effects of group-serving altruism. The use of a simplified
one-level model – considering only individual outputs –
might be due to issues of complexity. Even if plausibly – as
we argued before - people in daily life can distinguish
egoistic from group-serving individuals, this need not apply
to economic personnel evaluation contexts were evaluation
is based on given numbers, where reporting units often have
no direct acquaintance with the persons and processes
involved, and in such contexts one might perhaps more
easily ignore questions of group-serving behavior.
Additionally, the context of personnel evaluation may elicit
a competitive individual frame of mind.
This prompted our hypothesis that people in charge of
personnel-evaluation may ignore the positive or negative
effects of individuals on the work of other members of a
larger group (externalities), sticking only to a person’s direct
operating figures. This, however, may imply a “tragedy of
personnel selection”, since people with the best overall
effects on group-performance (e.g., by helping others and
indirectly contributing the most to the overall goals of a
company), might be evaluated the most negatively.

depended on the presence of an individual employee in a
shift, suggesting his or her importance to the overall
earnings of the team. We here call this employee “the
altruist,” since although not demonstrating particularly
positive earning figures individually, he or she enhances the
values for all other employees working during the same
shift. Note, that although a functionally defined altruism
would lead to the shown data, the number-based evaluation
context does provide evidence for any intentions or effort.
Hence, a perhaps more neutral term for the worker would
have been ‘facilitator’. We here nonetheless use the term
‘altruist’ as one easily conceivable interpretation. We aimed
to explore how far participants as Human Resources
managers take the essential indirect monetary contributions
of an altruist worker into account, when evaluating workers.

Design
Experiment 1 has a two (rounds: 10 working days versus 20
working days) by two (difference of earnings between a
normal worker with versus without the presence of the
altruist; see Table 1), within-subjects design.

Method
Participants 124 participants from the US volunteered for
the experiment via MTURK, each obtaining a reward of $1.
120 participants finished the computer experiment (59%
male, 41% female; mean age was 34 years; highest
education: 48% Bachelor or Master degree; 40% high
school degree). Participants were randomly assigned to one
of the four conditions (cf. Design).
Procedure and Material Participants in a computer
experiment should imagine being in the role of a Human
Resources manager evaluating the staff of a particular snack
bar. There were five staff members, but in each day only
four are working. Compared to many real personnel
evaluation situations one with only five persons is relatively
simple (cf. von Sydow, 2015, for a plausible innerindividual dilemma with ten nodes). Participants were
instructed to establish which workers contributed most to
the overall profit of the company, based on data provided by
the reporting unit of the larger company.
First, participants in all conditions read the same
instructions and overview description. Then, in the main
part, they obtained for each day transparent overview
information about the individual earnings of each of the four
employees (presented by a picture) working in the shift (at
this day), and information on the overall earnings (Figure 1).

Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, participants put themselves in the role of
Human Resources manager evaluating the utility of
employees in a local shop. The managers obtained
information on direct earnings of individuals and those of
the shop daily. The overall profit strongly positively

106

the overall earnings of the work group the most positively.
Given the higher number of normal workers, these
judgments are most clearly above chance-level, even for the
most critical condition: Chi2(1, 32) = 50,8, p < .0001).

Figure 1: Example of shown earnings at the individual
and group level on a particular day (Condition 1 or 2).
Figure 2: Percentages of choices of normal worker or
altruist worker as representing the highest (Panel A) or
lowest (Panel B) utility for the company (Condition 1 or 2).

The shown earnings of the normal workers and the altruist
worker were based mainly on the mean earnings shown in
Table 1. Additionally, we added some noise to each value (a
normal distribution with SD = 600 €).
We randomly assigned the altruist-role to one of the
pictures. The altruist randomly appeared in 6 of 10 rounds
(days). The four normal workers appeared randomly (on
average, 7.5 times in 10 rounds; or 15 times in 20 rounds).
We counterbalanced the presentation-order in each shift.
Participants could view the overview panels for each day as
long as they wanted and proceeded to the next round by
clicking a button when ready. After the 10 (or 20) rounds,
the ‘Human Resources managers’ evaluated the employees
of the snack bar in four tasks (each on a separate page).
First they had to choose which of the five workers was of
“the greatest total utility for your business”. If unsure, they
had to choose intuitively. Second, they chose which person
represented the lowest utility for the business. Third, they
ranked employees according to “their total utility for the
company in the present setting” (not reported here). Fourth,
they rated the earnings of the five workers (presented
randomly) on a scale of 1 to 10.
Finally, they had to provide further comments and
demographic data. Additionally, they were tested on the
Cognitive Reflection Task (Frederick, 2005) – a short task
measuring the tendency to override an initial automatic
albeit incorrect response by a reflectively corrected one –
and a attention test item checking how careful or superficial
people read instructions.

The rating task (Figure 3) likewise showed that, in all
conditions, the altruist was predominantly judged to be of
lower utility to the company than the normal workers.

Figure 3: Average ratings (with SE) in Experiment 1 for the
four normal workers (N) or altruist workers (A) of
Conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Panel A to D).
Overall, the results show that even if the ‘altruist’ worker
causes a decidedly higher increase in the overall earnings
than any ‘normal’ worker (Conditions 3 and 4) and this
could be observed over 20 rounds (Condition 2 and 4) the
altruist’s overall contribution is not reflected by the
evaluations of most participants (even though a small
significant effect of conditions was found). Actually, the
altruist is even evaluated most negatively by the vast
majority of participants.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2A shows that, in all conditions, a clear majority of
participants did not judge the altruist as representing the
highest utility for the company and there were hence no
large differences between conditions, the differences were
reliable (exact Chi2(3, 124) = 3.33, p < .05), with an average
of 7% detecting that the altruist had the highest utility in
Conditions 3 and 4, with only 1.5% in Conditions 1 and 2.
The preponderant selection of normal workers over altruists
over all conditions was statistically even more clearly above
chance (Chi2(1, 124) = 17.8, p < .001). Figure 2B shows
that, across conditions, a clear majority of participants
assigned even the lowest utility to the one who influenced

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 used the same personnel evaluation scenario
as in Experiment 1, involving an altruist who is individually
the lowest earner of the team but overall contributes the

107

most to the success of the group. However, Experiment 2
addressed several additional issues:
• Number of days and repeated measurement. We
investigated whether most people’s negative
evaluation of the group-serving altruist changed, if
people had to go through more learning-rounds.
Additionally, the participants had to evaluate the
workers not only once, but repeatedly.
• Personnel selection. We added a personnel selection
task, wherein the manager determined the
configuration of a shift. This should focus people more
on the overall earnings of a group, allowing for easier
detection of the altruist’s highest overall contribution.
• Selection of participants. Due to bad results in the
attention test, we aimed to rule out effects of
unmotivated participants from MTURK. Hence we
rigidly selected participants to exclude inattentive
participants at the beginning of the experiment.
• Sensitivity to distinguishing individual earnings.
Finally, we varied the earnings of the ‘normal’ workers
(whose presence did not affect other workers’
performance) to investigate whether participants were
able to distinguish different individual earnings.

MTURK; 156 continued and passed a first participationcriterion (time spent on the first page > 20 sec. and < 6
min.). Only 140 (90%) passed Criterion 2, i.e. correctly
rephrased the task. Of them, 120 (86 %) finished the
experiment (52% male, 48 female; mean age: 33 years;
highest education: 59% Bachelor or Master degree; 38%
high school degree). The participants were volunteers,
obtaining a reward of $1. Participants were randomly
assigned to one of four conditions (cf. Table 2).
Material and procedure We used a similar task with a
similar procedure and materials as in Experiment 1 (cf.
Figure 1). However, instead of 10 or 20 rounds with information about the individuals’ earnings and group-earnings,
participants here obtained information about 40 working
days (again each with four workers). For each day we
required participants to stay a minimum time on the
information screens (4 sec.), after which the ‘continue’
button could be pressed. We applied similar
counterbalancing measures as in Experiment 1.
Additionally to the changed payoff-structure (Table 2) we
now had four test-phases, where the workers should be
evaluated, with the test-phases following every ten rounds.
In the first three of them (following Rounds 10, 20 and 30)
we presented only one evaluation task but we added a new
personnel selection task. In the former, participants rated the
workers’ contribution to the group on a scale of 1 to 10. In
the new personnel selection task, participants were asked
which four of the five employees they would select to work
in a further shift the next day. It was mentioned that all five
employees wanted to work and that their choice should
optimize the profit for the company on that day. In the
fourth assessment phase we used all the evaluation measures
used in the single test-phase of Experiment 1 as well as the
described personal selection task.
Finally, we used (a) a brief Kimchi-Palmer–Test (similar
to a Navon-Test) to explore global versus local perception
preferences; (b) the attention test; and (c) participants
supplied demographic data and comments on the task.

Design
Table 2 shows the varied average earnings of the normal
workers in four conditions (C1 to C4). C1 has the same
payoff-structure as conditions C3 and C4 of Experiment 1
(with the clearest altruist’s contribution). Now in C2
additionally one normal worker (N1) stands out. In C3, N1
and N2 differ from N3 and N4, and in C4 all normal
workers differ from one another.

Results and Discussion
Since space precludes exhaustive treatment, we here
present only the results for the fourth and final assessment
phase of employees by the ‘managers’. However, the results
of all four phases are surprisingly similar.
Figure 4 presents the results of the rating task over all four
rounds. It shows that the order of the average ratings reflects
the individual mean differences shown between the normal
workers. People seem to be sensitive to these individual
differences, but not to the larger overall increase of group
earnings occurring when the altruist was in the team. The
ratings for the altruist in all conditions and phases were
lowest from the first phase onwards. Moreover, the
judgments appear quite stable over the time. Even in Phase
4 and the most critical condition, C4, the data was clearly at
odds with a potential prediction linked to judgements based
on the worker’s overall contribution (A > N1 > N2 > N3 >

In all conditions, the altruist’s presence strongly affected
the other workers’ earning and correlates highly and
consistently with group’s high earnings. Nevertheless, the
altruist individually had the lowest earnings. The overall
average earnings were kept constant over the conditions.

Method
Participants and strict selection criteria 228 participants
from the US checked the first page of the experiment in

also marked optimal selections that did not only involve the
altruist, but the best normal workers (dark grey shading).
But even without this distinction, and in the final Round 4,
the altruist were excluded clearly more often (dark shading)
than all other workers together, χ2(1, N = 120) = 32.0, p <
.001), also in the most critical condition, C4 (χ2(1, N = 29) =
5.83, p < .05).

normal worker (N) or the altruist worker (A) as of the

overall earnings in green.

N4) and contrasts showed significant results for all five
mean differences predicted based on individual contributions (N1 > N2 > N3 > N4 > A): N1 > N2: F(1, 28) = 5.5;
p < .05; N2 > N3: F(1, 28) = 96.8; p < .001; N3 > N4: F(1,
28) = 34.5; p < .001; N4 > A: F(1, 28) = 37.9; p < 001.

Figure 6 presents the proportions of the judgments in the
last test phase concerning which workers had the highest
and which had the lowest utility for the company. A clear
majority in all conditions did not assign the highest utility
based on the overall impact on the earnings of the group
(coloured green), but in line with individual earnings
(coloured red) (C4: χ2(1, N = 29) = 24.5, p < .001). In all
conditions, the majority of participants also assigned even
the lowest utility to the ‘altruist’ (Figure 4B). This was the
case in the most unclear condition (C4), since the red
choices were significantly more frequent than all other
choices taken together (χ2(1, N = 29) = 24.5, p < .001).
However, a small number of participants realized that the
altruist should be on the team. This is strongly supported by
ten comments of participants which showed an understanding of a difference between individual and overall
performance. For instance, Participant 111 wrote: “The ones
who sell the most aren't necessarily the top performers. The
sales always increased on days when the girl in the green
shirt was working although […] she didn't sell as well
herself. She seemed to bolster everyone else's sales, making
total sales increase by nearly 50%. This was consistent
every day she worked, therefore I rated her as extremely
important to the company.” These participants were all
among those who selected the altruist in the last round of the
personnel selection task (Figure 5) and 80% of them made
this selection already in Round 2 (only 30% in Round 1).

Figure 5: Results of the personnel selection task in the four
test phases, showing the proportion of ‘managers’ choosing
a team of four out of five, thus excluding worker N1, N2,
N3, N4, or the altruist worker.
The added personnel-selection task (Figure 5) could have
elicited better results, since it emphasizes the overall
earnings of different group configurations. Participants may
thus have realized the clearly lower outcome of configurations without the altruist relatively to the four other
configurations. But Figure 5 shows that, even in this task,
the participants tended to exclude the best player from the
team (dark selections). This was quite stable over time. We

General Discussion
In sum, participants in all conditions of both experiments
tended to focus on comparing the individuals’ earnings
without considering their overall contribution to the

109

earnings of the group. Although Experiment 1 showed a
small effect of conditions, the illicit individualist judgments
remained dominant both with a high-impact altruist and
with 20 (instead of 10) rounds. Experiment 2 showed that
participants were well able to distinguish even much smaller
individual performance differences. Experiment 2 nonetheless corroborated the finding that people tend to wrongly
evaluate the group-serving altruist lowest, despite the 40
rounds with four repeated test-phases. Even the personnelselection task, which might have focused participants more
closely on the overall earnings in different configurations of
the team, the best team player was most often excluded from
the team. As a conclusion, a “tragedy of personnel
selection” may occur when people who contribute clearly
the most to the overall performance are evaluated the most
negatively due to their lower individual contribution.
The outcome was not ‘tragic’ for all participants, since
some, but few, participant’s selections and comments
revealed that they clearly had detected the positive overall
effect of the ‘altruist’.
Nonetheless, the tragic results in our task with an
ecologically rather low or at least common complexity may
be due to various explanations. First, the tragedy may be
tied to the abstract form of evaluation based on numbers
only. But number-based evaluations play an increasing role
in companies. Second, the evaluation-context might have
elicited a kind of competition or individualism framing,
preventing participants from considering helpful behaviour.
But we conducted a further egoist-detection personnel
evaluation experiment, which led to only partial
improvements. Third, the tragedy of personnel selection
may well be based on more general and cognitive
mechanisms. For instance, it may be related to (a) a general
difficulty to realize that many small externalities can add up
to large payoffs (e.g., von Sydow, 2015, Dörner, 1993); (b)
some general problems of understanding interaction effects
(e.g., Novick & Cheng, 2004); or (c) general problems
dealing with multilevel representations and the Simpson’s
paradox (Fiedler, Walther, Freytag, & Nickel, 2003;
Waldmann & Hagmayer, 2001; von Sydow, Hagmayer, &
Meder, 2016). Whatever the causes are, the practical
importance of the problem of detecting group-serving
employees and building most efficient teams (based on
more than individual excellence) can hardly be
overestimated, for both companies and other organizations.
Our findings suggest that there may be a tragedy of
personnel selection in the real world as well, with
implications for the sensibleness of incentive-structures
(personnel evaluation), employee-advancement (personnel
promotion) and job offers (personnel selection).
