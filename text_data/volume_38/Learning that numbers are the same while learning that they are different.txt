Figure 1. Cumulative frequency per million of various number words across development, plotted on a log10 scale (e.g. M12 is in all
corpora for all kids up to 12 months of age, M72 is for all corpora for all kids up to 72 months of age). Note that across the three sub-
figures, the scale of the y-axis changes, reflecting the large differences between big and small numbers.

      When looking at co-occurrence of number words with             collocations can be seen, including those that encode
all other words in the corpus, interesting patterns emerge,          relations due to time (such as numbers like six and twelve
which are suggestive of what children can learn about
numbers based on these co-occurrence patterns. First, one of
the most apparent facts is how similar all the number words
were in terms of the words with which they frequently co-
occurred. This is a big part of why (as we show in the next
section) it would be easy to learn that number words belong
to the same category. Next, one can clearly see how
grammatical number and conceptual number are
interrelated, with the number one co-occurring with the
plural form “s” much less often than other numbers (of
which “s” would be the most frequent collocation for
many). Finally, it is apparent that many of the frequent
collocations of numbers are other numbers (and numbers
that are nearby in order), evidence of the extent to which
counting and other ordering is highly frequent in child
directed speech.
