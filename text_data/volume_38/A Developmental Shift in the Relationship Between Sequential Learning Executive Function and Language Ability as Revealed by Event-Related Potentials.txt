Abstract
Previous research has shown a link between sequential
learning (SL) and language as well as links between executive
function (EF) and both language and SL. However, little
research has focused on both the development of the
relationship between these factors and their neurological
underpinnings. Here we report a study of the event-related
potential (ERP) correlates of SL and behavioral measures of
language and EF in a sample of 7-12-year-old children.
Results revealed that both SL and EF had independent
associations with language development but that the
contribution that both made toward language development
shifted dramatically between the ages of 7 to 11-12 years. The
results furthermore suggest that this developmental shift may
be due in part to the maturation of EF abilities and changes
due to neural entrenchment and commitment as a
consequence of language acquisition.

Introduction
The ability to encode statistical structure in temporally
ordered sequences and make predictions about the world
based on that structure is referred to as structured sequence
processing or sequential learning (SL). There is a growing
body of evidence suggesting that SL is an important
mechanism underlying spoken language acquisition (e.g.,
Conway, Bauernschmidt, Huang, & Pisoni, 2010). For
example, infants and adults can both learn artificial spoken
languages in the laboratory based only on transitional
probabilities (e.g., Romberg & Saffran, 2013, adults;
Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996, infants). Auditory
statistical learning tasks can also uniquely predict adults’
ability to comprehend English sentences (e.g., Misyak &
Christiansen, 2012). In addition, several studies have linked
individual differences in visual SL (VSL) to individual
differences in various aspects of language, including, for
example, adults’ incidental learning of a grammar in a
sequential memory task correlating with their ability to
predict words in a spoken sentence (Conway, et al. 2010),
individual differences in children’s VSL independently
predicting their ability to comprehend English syntax (Kidd
& Arciuli, 2015), and VSL abilities of children with
cochlear implants correlating with their performance on
language measures (Conway, Pisoni, Anaya, Karpicke, &

Henning, 2011). One recent study found that infants’ VSL
predicted later vocabulary and gesture comprehension
(Shafto, Conway, Field, and Houston, 2012). In addition,
there is some neural evidence showing a connection
between SL and language. For instance, Christiansen,
Conway, and Onnis (2012) found that an event-related
potential (ERP) component that is typically considered an
index of syntactic processing in natural language was
elicited by incongruities in both an SL task and a natural
language processing task in adults.
Recent research also suggests strong positive relationships
between executive function (EF) and both SL (e.g.,
Bahlmann, Korb, Gratton, & Friederici, 2012) and language
(e.g., January, Trueswell, & Thompson-Schill, 2009).
Because SL is the ability to make predictions about the
world based on statistical structure in temporally ordered
sequences, it makes sense that some EF mechanisms, such
as attention, cognitive control, cognitive flexibility, working
memory, and inhibition, would contribute to SL ability in
the same way that it does to language ability. In addition, as
with SL and language, there is some evidence for an overlap
in the neural mechanisms underlying SL and EF (Bahlmann
et al., 2012).
However, there is very little research that addresses the
developmental trajectory of the relationship between SL,
EF, and language ability, especially in combination with
neural measures. In light of this, we aimed to examine the
relationship between SL as measured by ERPs, EF, and
spoken language ability throughout a 5-year period in
childhood. We chose the age range 7-12 years for two
reasons: 1) there has been relatively less research on SL in
middle childhood, with the bulk of the research having been
done on infancy through preschool and adolescence through
adulthood, and 2) as brought up in the Discussion, 7 years
and 12 years appear to be ages at which there are major
changes in the development of both SL and language
(Janacsek, Fiser, & Nemeth, 2012; Johnson & Newport,
1989). We hypothesized that because EF skills appear to
contribute to both SL and language abilities and SL is an
important component of language development, EF and SL
would both directly predict language ability, but that EF
would also affect language through the mediator of SL. In
addition, we hypothesized that because of the protracted
nature of EF’s development (e.g., Best & Miller, 2010),

1074

these relationships would differ at various ages, suggesting
age as a moderator (see Figure 1).

learning task. The target followed the high predictor on 90%

standard with no preceding predictor. A random number of
standards were presented before each predictor (or NP)..

Method
Participants
Thirty-eight typically developing and hearing monolingual
English-speaking children between the ages of 7 and 12
years (M = 9.13 years, SD = 1.9 years; 15 female)
participated.

ERP Recording and Analysis

Sequential Learning Task
Children were told a story about a magician who tried to
make food for his children using his magic hat. Participants
were told to “catch” the sporadically presented food by
pressing a button. Children then viewed a stream of stimuli
consisting of hats of different colors presented one at a time
(for each: 500ms stimulus, 500ms black screen; SOA:
1000ms). Occasionally, a target hat with food depicted
above it was presented within the stream. Unbeknownst to
participants, hats of three different colors each differentially
predicted the occurrence of the target hat, which we refer to
as high-probability predictors, low-probability predictors,
and standards. When the high-probability (HP) predictor
was presented, it was immediately followed by the target
90% of the time and the standard 10% of the time. The lowprobability (LP) predictor was followed by the target 20%
of the time and the standard 80% of the time. In addition,
the target was occasionally presented directly after a
standard without a preceding predictor (no-predictor, NP).
Figure 2 shows a schematic of the sequential learning task.
Based on previous results using a similar task (Jost,
Conway, Purdy, Walk, & Hendricks, 2015), it was expected
that if children learned the transitional probabilities between
the predictors and the target, there should be differences in
both response times (RTs) to the targets and ERPs to the
predictors based on whether a trial was a HP, LP, or NP
trial. These differences would constitute evidence of SL.
Although RT findings supported the ERP findings, to
conserve space, they will not be discussed in this paper.

ERPs were collected using a 32-channel sensor net and
preprocessed using Net Station Version 4.3.1 (Electrical
Geodesics, Inc.). ERPs were time-locked to the onset of
each predictor stimulus or in the case of the NP condition,
the standard that preceded the target during the SL task.
This resulted in 60 trials for each of the three predictor
conditions (HP, LP, and NP).
The remainder of processing was done using custom
scripts in MATLAB (version R2012b 8.0.0783;
MathWorks) and the EEGLAB Toolbox (version
10.2.2.24a, Delorme & Makeig; 2004) for MATLAB to
remove artifacts and replace bad channels. Participants were
required to have a minimum of 20 good epochs per
condition in each half of the SL task to be included in
further analyses.

Executive Function Task
Executive function (EF) was assessed with a version of the
Eriksen Flanker Task, which is thought to tap into selective
attention, conflict response, and response inhibition
mechanisms, all of which fall under the umbrella of EF.
Horizontal arrays of arrows were presented on a computer
screen, and children were told to respond only to the arrow
in the center. They were to indicate whether the arrow was
pointing left or right while ignoring the flanking arrows
which could be facing the same direction (congruent) or
opposite direction (incongruent). Response times to
incongruent and congruent trials were recorded separately
and average incongruent RTs subtracted from average
congruent RTs to give a Flanker score (a higher score
indicates higher EF).

Language Assessment
We assessed children’s language ability with the Sentence
Completion subtest of the Comprehensive Assessment of
Spoken Language (CASL; Carrow-Woolfolk, 1999). In this
test, sentences are read without their final word, and
children are asked to give a semantically and grammatically
correct single word ending. We chose this assessment
because it parallels a sentence prediction task that was
positively associated with adults’ SL (Conway et al., 2010).

Results
ERP Analyses
Based on the ERPs to the SL task described in Jost et al.
(2015), we chose to analyze the ERP time window 400-700
ms post-stimulus presentation from the medial posterior
region of sensor net. This is the time window and region in
which Jost et al. (2015) found ERP effects in a very similar
paradigm and with children of similar ages. Visual
inspection of the grand averaged ERP waveforms (Figure 3)
suggests that there was a P300-like positivity in the
posterior medial region within a similar window as that
found by Jost et al. (2015). This positivity was especially
visible for the HP condition in the second half of the task
(Figure 3B), consistent with the notion that learning the
predictor-target contingencies occurred toward the end of
the task, after sufficient exposure to the statistical
probabilities (as was also observed in Jost et al., 2015).
Furthermore, based on visual inspection, this positivity
appears to consist of two different peaks where the predictor
conditions appear to be differentiated: 300-600 ms and 600750 ms post stimulus presentation. Therefore, we chose to
analyze each of these time windows separately. Results for
the 600-750ms window are presented here, although both
windows yielded similar results. This 600-750ms window
has the advantage of being within the time window analyzed
by Jost et al. (2015) with children as well as within the
window where Christiansen et al. (2012) found overlap
between ERPs to a language task and an SL task.

A 3 (predictor: high probability predictor, low probability

half SL task) repeated measures ANOVA was done on
ERPs in the 600-750ms window to examine the effects of
predictor type and block on the mean ERP amplitudes.
Results revealed a significant main effect of predictor, F(2,
74) = 7.67, p = .001, ηp2 = .17, and a significant interaction
between predictor and block, F(2, 74) = 5.08, p = .009, ηp2 =
.12. The main effect of block was not significant. Predictor
effect post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that HP ERP
amplitude was significantly greater than both LP (p = .039)
and NP amplitudes (p = .004). For the interaction, post hoc
pairwise comparisons showed that only HP increased across
blocks (p = .002). All posthoc tests were Sidak corrected for
multiple comparisons.

Conditional Process Model
To test the conceptual model of the relationship between
EF, SL, language, and age depicted in Figure 1 in which EF
has both direct and indirect effects (mediated by SL) on
language and all relationships with language are moderated
by age, we constructed a statistical conditional process
model. First, we created composite SL scores to capture the
level of learning across the task. First, the ERP amplitude
difference of HP minus LP was calculated to capture the
amount of differentiation between high and low probability
predictors, which indicates a basic level of learning. Then,
HP-LP for the 1st block was subtracted from HP-LP for the
2nd block to show change over time during the task, which
indicates the amount that learning increased as the task
progressed. We refer to this measure as “HP-LP change”.
The conditional process model was tested using Hayes’s
(2013) PROCESS macro Model 59 with bootstrapping in
SPSS. Bootstrapping was used to ameliorate the relatively
small sample size. One additional participant was removed
at this point because she met outlier criteria for the
regression. We tested the model with HP-LP changes as the
SL variable. For the EF measure, we used the Flanker score
(congruent RT minus incongruent RT), and we used a
continuous measure of age. Standard Sentence Completion
score was the outcome measure.
Both predictive models, that between EF and SL with SL
as the outcome and that predicting language (Sentence
Completion) as the outcome from EF and SL, were
significant (see Tables 1 and 2). SL does mediate the
relationship between EF and language, but only with age
moderating both the predictive link between EF to SL and
the predictive link between SL to language. In addition, the
EF measure, Flanker, significantly positively predicted
language as measured by Sentence Completion. SL and age
also positively predicted language (although SL only did so
marginally). Age significantly moderated the relationships
between EF and SL and between SL and language and
marginally significantly moderated the relationship between
EF and language, suggesting that the relationships between
all of these constructs change with age. To visualize these
changes in relationships that occur with age, we divided

participants into three age groups of approximately equal
size, 7-year-olds (n = 12), 8-10-year-olds (n = 13), and 1112-year-olds (n = 12), and produced scatter plots to show
each relationship (see Figure 5).

patterns (see Figures 6 and 7). Visual inspection of the
waveforms reveals that for the 7-year-olds, there is a P300like positivity that is most pronounced for the HP condition
in the second block of the task. On the other hand, for the

Inspection of the scatter plots reveals that all three
relationships are quite different for older (11-12 years)
versus younger (7 years) children. Younger children
exhibited a positive relationship between EF and SL, which
was expected given Bahlmann et al.’s (2012) findings and
our prediction that EF would underlie SL abilities. The
older children’s negative relationship between EF and SL is
more puzzling, but seems to be driven by two participants
who had high SL scores but low EF scores. For the
remaining plots, younger children (and even middle age
children) seem to have a relatively strong positive
relationship between EF and language skills while there is
practically no relationship for older children. The opposite is
true for SL and language: older children have a strong
positive relationship while younger have little relationship
or even a negative relationship. Thus, it appears that EF is a
more important contributor to language development for our
younger children while SL is more important for our older
children.
To further inspect differences between the oldest and
youngest children, we created separate ERP waveforms for
the two age groups to look for evidence of differences in SL

predictor interaction, F(2, 20) = 8.87, p = .002, ηp2 = .47 for
7-year-olds but no significant effects for 11-12-year-olds.
This may suggest that while 7-year-olds showed SL over
time, 11-12-year-olds did not evidence SL over time. For
the 7-year-olds, predictor differences did not hold for post
hoc tests, but posthoc pairwise comparisons for the
interaction indicated that only HP increased from the first
half to the second half (p = .015), although there was a trend
toward NP decreasing across blocks (p = .065).

Discussion
This study sought to examine how sequential learning (SL)
and executive function contribute to language across
development. In a sample of 7-12 year old children, we used
ERPs to measure the neural correlates of SL in a visual
statistical-sequential learning task. The ERPs revealed that
the youngest children showed evidence of statistical
learning whereas the oldest did not (however, see Arcuili &
Simpson, 2011, for evidence of increased SL with age using
a different SL task). In addition, we used a conditional
process model to assess the extent that SL in conjunction

with EF was associated with a behavioral measure of
language development for the different age groups. The
results of this model revealed that both SL and EF had their
own independent contributions to language development,
but the relationship between both SL and language and EF
and language showed dramatic shifts occurring between 7
years and 11-12 years of age.
As SL has been considered to be an implicit process, and
implicit learning has been argued to be developmentally
invariant (e.g., Reber, 1993; Vintner & Perruchet, 2000;
though see Thomas et al., 2004, for an opposing view), the
observed finding that there may be a developmental change
in SL is particularly important. Further, this development of
SL seems to be accompanied by a counterintuitive
developmental change to the relationship between SL and
language ability.
Although the finding that younger children show better
sequential learning than older children and that there may be
opposite relationships between SL and language across ages
may seem puzzling, some previous findings may provide
clarity. For example, in examining SL across the lifespan,
Janacsek, Fiser, and Nemeth (2012) found that 4-12-yearolds had the strongest learning effects as measured by RTs
with a dramatic decrease in SL ability around 12 years that
continued to decline across the lifespan. However, accuracy
scores were worst in the children and elderly participants
with highest scores at the middle ages. Janacsek et al.
(2012) suggested that these findings may be the result of
tapping into two separate systems, with accuracy related to
voluntary attentional control (an under-developed EF
mechanism in early childhood) and RT related to
involuntary attention mechanisms. Jost, Conway, Purdy, and
Hendricks (2011) also presented findings that younger
children may display heightened statistical learning abilities
compared to older children and adults. Similarly, McNealy
et al. (2011) found that younger children (5-7 years old)
showed greater neural activation to weak statistical cues
governing a novel stream of nonsense syllables, compared
to older children (9-10 and 12-13 year olds) and adults. It
may be advantageous to have efficient information
processing mechanisms for detecting statistical patterns
early in development, which could provide an explanation
for why young children are able to learn natural language so
effectively.
According to Kuhl (2004), infants and young children
who have had relatively little experience are extremely open
to learning; however, the more they learn, the more
entrenched and neurally committed their brains become to
the specific statistical and prosodic patterns of their own
language. This may allow children and adults to readily
process sequential structure of their native language, but
may also have the side effect of making it more difficult to
learn other sequential structures. This shift can be seen
around 9 months when infants begin to stop using and
recognizing sounds from non-native languages but improve
in their ability to use and recognize sounds from their native
language (Kuhl, 2004); another shift appears to occur

1078

around 7 years and at adolescence, both times at which
learning a foreign language fluently becomes much more
difficult (e.g., Johnson & Newport, 1989).
Thus the anchor ages that we tested (7 and 12 years) are
precisely at points when previous research has found
changes in both SL and language that amount to both
decreases in performance of unfamiliar items and increases
in performance involving familiar items (e.g., native
language and its underlying statistical structure). Voluntary
attentional control (an EF mechanism improving over this
period) and involuntary attention (an already developed
mechanism) may also play a role in the relationships
between SL, language, and age. We suggest that at around 7
years of age, continued openness to unfamiliar sequence
structures is detrimental to language development. By 12
years, SL is lower in general than it is for 7-year-olds, but
within that lower level individuals with higher SL combined
with overall higher EF provides a benefit to language
ability. As suggested by Arciuli and Torkildsen (2012),
longitudinal research is necessary to fully flesh out the
complicated interrelationships between sequential learning,
language, executive function and age. Although these
findings are still preliminary, we expect this research to lead
to valuable information about the basic nature of the
neurocognitive mechanisms of language development.
