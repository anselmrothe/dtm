     Inspection of the scatter plots reveals that all three
 relationships are quite different for older (11-12 years)

 versus younger (7 years) children. Younger children
 exhibited a positive relationship between EF and SL, which
 was expected given Bahlmann et al.’s (2012) findings and
 our prediction that EF would underlie SL abilities. The
 older children’s negative relationship between EF and SL is
 more puzzling, but seems to be driven by two participants
 who had high SL scores but low EF scores. For the
 remaining plots, younger children (and even middle age
 children) seem to have a relatively strong positive
 relationship between EF and language skills while there is
 practically no relationship for older children. The opposite is
 true for SL and language: older children have a strong
 positive relationship while younger have little relationship
 or even a negative relationship. Thus, it appears that EF is a
 more important contributor to language development for our
 younger children while SL is more important for our older
 children.                                                           Figure 5: Scatter plots depicting the relationships between
