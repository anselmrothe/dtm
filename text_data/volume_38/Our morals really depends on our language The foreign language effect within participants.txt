within-subjects design; however, the effect’s appearance
seems to vary between within- and between-subject designs
in judgment and decision making tasks, such as the framing
task. Additionally, results of the framing tasks indicate that
an existence of the foreign language effect depend on how
to define the effect. Hence, foreign language’s effect on
reasoning and decision-making appears to partly depend on
task type. Future research should therefore aim to determine
the relationship between the foreign language effect and
task type and illuminate the mechanism underlying that
relationship.
