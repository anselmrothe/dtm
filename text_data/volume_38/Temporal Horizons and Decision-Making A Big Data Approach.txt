between smaller present and larger future rewards (Figure

whether a long temporal horizon might increase
participants’ sensitivity to future costs.
   In Experiment 3, participants completed the Balloon

task, participants are presented with a series of 30 balloons

the balloon, but they take a risk by doing so: the balloon
may pop, resulting in no points for the trial. Alternatively, at
any time participants may bank points currently earned and
