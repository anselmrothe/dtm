Abstract
Cross-linguistic research has shown that boundaries for
lexical categories differ from language to language. The aim
of this study is to explore these differences between languages
in relation to the categorization differences within a language.
Monolingual Dutch- (N=400) and French-speaking (N=300)
Belgian adults provided lexical category judgments for three
lexical categories that are roughly equivalent in Dutch and
French. Each category was represented by good, borderline,
and bad examples. A mixture modeling approach enabled us
to identify latent groups of categorizers within a language and
to evaluate cross-linguistic variation in relation to withinlanguage variation. We found complex patterns of lexical
variation within as well as between language groups. Even
within a seemingly homogeneous group of speakers sharing
the same mother tongue, latent groups of categorizers display
a variability that resembles patterns of lexical variation found
at a cross-linguistic level of comparison.

Introduction
People of different languages and cultures share a
perception of the similarity among entities within at least
some domains (e.g., common household containers: Ameel,
Storms, Malt, & Sloman, 2005; Malt, Sloman, Gennari, Shi,
& Wang, 1999; color: Roberson, Davies, Corbett, &
Vandervyver, 2005: human locomotion: Malt, Ameel, Imai,
Gennari, Saji, & Majid, 2014; and spatial relations:
Munnich, Landau, & Dosher, 2001). Despite the shared
non-linguistic appreciation of these domains, its relation
with linguistic categorization is complex: Linguistic
categories do not map directly onto similarity clusters
(Ameel et al., 2005; Malt et al., 1999).
In different languages the world is carved up differently.
This cross-linguistic variation has been shown for domains
as varied as color, causality, mental states, number, body
parts, containers, motion, direction, and spatial relations
(Malt & Majid, 2013; Malt et al., 2015). Malt and
colleagues, for instance, described how different languages
label a set of household containers and found that not all
languages observe the same distinctions, despite perceiving

the similarity of the objects in the same way (Ameel et al.,
2005; Malt, Sloman, & Gennari, 2003; Malt et al., 1999).
For example, the Dutch word for bottle (fles) encompasses
objects that in French are either called bouteille or flacon.
Not only are there differences in the number of distinctions
made in different languages, there is crosscutting in the way
exemplars of a category are grouped together as well (Malt
et al., 2003). The roughly equivalent French bouteille and
Dutch fles demonstrate a difference in how they map onto a
shared similarity space, which reflects a cross-linguistic
difference in meaning representation. Additionally, the
categories fles and bouteille each include a different number
of objects, indicating differences in category extension as
well.
Although these cross-linguistic differences have received
growing attention in recent years, within-language variation
exists as well (McCloskey & Glucksberg, 1978; Verheyen,
Hampton, & Storms, 2010). Inter-individual differences in
linguistic categorization have been described in the relation
to vagueness (Black, 1937; Verheyen & Storms, 2013). A
distinction is made between vagueness in criteria and
vagueness in degree (Devos, 2003). The former is involved
when individuals use different criteria to determine if an
object belongs to a category. When individuals agree on the
criteria for category membership but use a different cut-off
for separating members from non-members, the latter type
of vagueness is in play. In seemingly homogeneous groups
of speakers of the same language, groups that display one or
both types of differences have been identified (Verheyen &
Storms, 2013).
The aim of this study is to quantitatively explore the
extent and nature of differences in categorization between
two language groups with respect to the variation existing
between latent groups of categorizers within a language.
More specifically this study evaluates the degree of withinlanguage variability in relation to the degree of crosslinguistic variability for roughly equivalent categories. To
this end we collected category judgment data from Belgian
Dutch and French speaking participants, who share a similar
environment and who perceive similarity in the tested
domain in much the same way (Ameel et al., 2005).

1955

A mixture modeling approach was used in order to
identify latent groups of categorizers in a seemingly
homogeneous group, that is, adult speakers of the same
mother tongue. The mixture model partitions a participant
sample into subgroups of individuals who display similar
categorization behavior. By doing so, it identifies subgroups
that use different criteria in making their category decisions
(Verheyen & Storms, 2013; Verheyen, Voorspoels &
Storms, 2015). We compared the categorization patterns of
Dutch-speaking and French-speaking Belgian participants
for the roughly equivalent categories doos and boîte (similar
to English box), fles and bouteille (similar to English bottle)
and pot and pot (similar to English jar). We also identified
latent groups within each language, and the differences
between the latent within-language groups were compared
to those between languages.

Method
Participants
We collected data from approximately 400 monolingual
Dutch-speaking and 300 monolingual French-speaking
Belgian adult participants. Data from participants who were
determined to be bilingual were discarded, as well as data of
participants under the age of 17, resulting in the sample
sizes displayed in Table 2.

participants were also taken into account. Some objects that
showed incongruities in the use of category labels between
Dutch and French were included. For instance, a cooking
pot was called pot by almost all Dutch participants, while in
French this is rarely called pot.
For the French version of the task, four categories were
selected based on naming data of adult monolingual French
participants, analogous to the category selection for the
Dutch version. The four most generated category names
were bouteille, pot, flacon, and boîte. Because these
categories do not map directly onto the categories for the
Dutch task (Malt et al., 1999), the French task was
composed as follows. The stimulus set for bouteille and
flacon both consisted of the objects presented in the Dutch
category fles. For the French category boîte the items
belonging to the Dutch category doos, and for the French
category pot the items belonging to the Dutch category pot
were presented. The French speaking participants judged the
same set of objects as the Dutch speaking participants, with
the exception of two objects that were only presented in the
Dutch category bus. Further descriptions will be limited to
the roughly equivalent categories doos-boîte, fles-bouteille
and pot-pot. The categories flacon and bus will be
disregarded in the discussion of the results, since they do
not have a roughly equivalent category in Dutch and French,
respectively.

Procedure

Materials
The stimulus material consisted of an existing set of
pictures of household containers described by Ameel et al.
(2005) expanded with new stimuli, totaling to 192 stimuli.
The new pictures were made according to the guidelines
used by Ameel et al. (2005). The objects were photographed
in color against a neutral background with a constant camera
distance to preserve relative size. A ruler was included in
front of each object to provide additional size information.
Four lexical categories were investigated, selected based
on unpublished naming data for the full set of 192 common
household objects. The four most frequently generated
category names across the complete set by 32 monolingual
Dutch-speaking adult participants were fles, pot, bus, and
doos. Because it was not feasible to conduct a categorization
experiment with multiple categories for the complete set, a
selection of 40 stimuli per category was made. In order to
make an adequate selection of the stimuli, a pilot category
judgment task with approximately 30 Dutch speaking
participants was conducted. In the pilot study participants
had to decide if a given name was suited for a presented
object by responding ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
The stimuli for this study were selected based on the
results of the pilot study according to the following criteria.
The selected set of stimuli spanned the full range of
proportion of yes-responses, varying from approximately
0.10 to 0.90. This selection contained a mixture of clear
members, borderline members, and clear non-members,
spanning the range of shapes and sizes for the category. The
earlier collected naming data of Dutch and French

The linguistic categorization task was conducted via
Qualtrics and the link to the task was distributed via social
networks (e.g. Facebook), both for the French-speaking and
Dutch-speaking participants. After informed consent,
demographical information was collected (age, gender,
education level, and mother tongue). The participants were
instructed to decide for each item in the series whether or
not it belonged to a particular category. The four categories
were presented to participants in random order, as were the
pictures within each category. Above every picture the
question ‘Is this an X?’ was displayed, which participants
could respond to by choosing ‘yes’ or ‘no’. The instructions
explicitly stated that pictured objects could belong to one or
more categories and that there were no right or wrong
answers. The full survey took between 10 to 15 minutes to
complete.

Model analyses
Item response theory (IRT) modeling can be used as a
formalization of the Threshold Theory of Semantic
Categorization (Hampton, 1995; Verheyen, Hampton, &
Storms, 2010). The Threshold Theory (Hampton, 1995,
1998, 2007) accounts for vagueness in degree by allowing
individuals to use a different cut-off or threshold along the
criterion for category membership. In that case participants
diverge only with respect to the category’s extension.
The use of a mixture IRT model allows for the
identification of subgroups within a seemingly
homogeneous group, that use different criteria in their

1956

category judgment. By allowing for subgroups, the
assumption that all participants employ the same criterion is
relaxed, and thus vagueness in criteria is accounted for.
Within each of the identified groups, individuals can still
differ in terms of their categorization cut-off.
Individual categorization decisions Yci, where c refers to a
categorizer and i to an item, serve as input for the mixture
model. When an item i is endorsed as a category member by
categorizer c, Yci takes value 1; when it is not endorsed as a
member of the target category it takes value 0. Each of these
categorization judgments is regarded as an outcome of a
Bernoulli trial with equation (1) modeling the probability of
a positive response.
(1)
For each latent group g of categorizers a separate criterion
is extracted. The values for the parameters βgi, θc, and g are
estimated by application of the model to an item by
participant categorization matrix. The position of each item
i along the criterion of group g is indicated by the estimate
βgi and represents the extent to which that item meets the
group’s criterion. θc represents categorizer c’s threshold or
cut-off: the extent to which items need to meet the criterion
to be endorsed as category members. The relative position
of θc and βgi defines the probability of endorsement: the
more βgi exceeds θc, the higher the probability that the item
will be endorsed as a category member. Conversely, the
more to the left of θc βgi is positioned, the lower the
probability that the item will be endorsed. A separate g for
each group determines the shape of the response function
(Verheyen & Storms, 2013; Verheyen, Voorspoels, &
Storms, 2015).
For each of the six (3 categories x 2 languages) data sets,
the model in Equation (1) was estimated with 1, 2, 3, 4, and
5 different groups. The parameters in Equation (1) were
estimated in a Bayesian manner, using WinBUGS (Lunn,
Thomas, Best, & Spiegelhalter, 2000) running 3 chains of
10,000 samples each with a burn-in of 4,000 samples. The
chains were checked for convergence and label switching.
The reported results are based on the posterior means for the
models that yielded the smallest Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC). These models yield the best approximation
of the categorization data when both model fit and
complexity are taken into account. See Verheyen,
Voorspoels, and Storms (2015) for example code, rationale
for prior specification, and model selection simulations.

Results

follow a roughly similar rising trend. However, several
notable differences in categorization proportions can be
observed as well.
The categorization proportions for the French boîte
(M=0.45) are on average higher than the categorization
proportions for the Dutch doos (M=0.40) (t(39) = 3.287, p <
0.01). The observation that boîte has a larger category
extension than doos suggests a degree difference: the
category boîte is somewhat larger than the category doos.
This is not the only difference between the two categories.
There are also indications that the two language groups use
different categorization criteria since the shape of the
proportion curves is not the same. If the x-axis of the graph
would be organized according to the categorization
proportions of the French participants, one would obtain a
different order of the items along the axis. This is
demonstrated by an imperfect correlation of 0.78 between
doos and boîte. Some of the French proportions are even
lower than the corresponding Dutch ones, despite the
established degree difference. So although the French
category boîte includes more objects in general, some
objects are not considered to be as good a category member
as they are in the smaller Dutch category doos.

Figure 1: Categorization proportions per item for the
French category boîte and the Dutch category doos. The
order of the items is determined according to the Dutch
categorization proportions.
As to the other categories1, bouteille (M=0.24) displays
significantly lower categorization proportions than fles
(M=0.38) ((t(39) = -6.213, p < 0.001), and pot (F) (M=0.33)
does not display a significant difference with pot (D)
(M=0.35) (t(39) = -1.354, p = 0.1837). This indicates a
difference in degree for the categories fles-bouteille, but not
for pot-pot. The correlations between fles-bouteille (0.83)
and pot-pot (0.74) suggest that both category pairs show a
difference in criteria.

Cross-linguistic differences
We start by presenting the results for all participants of a
language group. Figure 1 displays per item the
categorization proportion of French participants for the
French category boîte and of Dutch participants for the
Dutch category doos. This graph confirms the idea that boîte
and doos are roughly equivalent categories since the
categorization proportions for French and Dutch seem to

1

Due to space limitations only the graphs for the categories
doos and boîte are displayed. Similar graphs were made for the
categories fles–bouteille and pot–pot. These figures were similar to
those presented and lead to the same conclusions. A discussion of
the results using doos–boîte was preferred since this category
yields the same number of latent groups in Dutch and French and
thus allows for a straightforward comparison.

Within-language differences
To study within-language differences we identified latent
groups of categorizers using the mixture IRT-approach.
Table 1 shows the BIC values for every category, for
partitionings2 in one to five groups. The solution with the
lowest BIC (indicating the appropriate number of subgroups
to consider) is in bold typeface.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 display the categorization
proportions in the three latent subgroups for the French
category boîte and the Dutch category doos. The amount of
variability within each language is striking. Even within a
language, there appears to be only limited consensus with
respect to categorization decisions. While one may expect
some disagreement in the middle part of the curve for the
borderline objects, there is also considerable disagreement
at the ends of the curve, which should hold the clear
members and clear non-members of the category for which
one would expect to find strong agreement among speakers
of the same mother tongue.

2 For the categories fles and pot (D) a group consisting of,
respectively, only one and ten participants was identified. In those
cases the analyses were repeated without these participants,
resulting in the numbers shown in Table 2.

This finding is not the result of the mixture analysis
yielding smaller groups of categorizers who show more
variability in their categorization data. The reliabilities 3
shown in Table 3 refute the possibility that the variability
displayed in the graphs is due to unreliability. All
reliabilities exceed 0.95 demonstrating that the participants
in a subgroup performed in much the same way.

3 Reliability was evaluated by applying the split-half method,
followed by the Spearman–Brown correction. The displayed
reliability is the average reliability across 10,000 random splits.

1958

If the mixture analyses succeeded in identifying
homogeneous groups of categorizers, the reliability within
each group of latent categorizers should be higher than the
reliability for the language group as a whole (if the groups
are equated for number of participants). To evaluate whether
this is true, a sampling procedure was used. Table 4 displays
the average split-halves reliability across 10,000 random
splits of the data of 25 randomly drawn participants from
either the complete language group (all) or one of the latent
groups within a language.
With the exception of two groups (doos group 2 and boîte
group 1) the data indeed show the pattern we expected,
showing that the variability we observe in the graphs is not
random variation but reflects meaningful between-groupdifferences within a language. This is the case for the latent
groups within both the Dutch and French language groups.

within a language do not exceed the correlation between the
language groups (0.78). It also becomes clear that there are
groups of categorizers who show a higher correlation with
latent groups of the other language compared to correlations
within their language group. For example, the categorization
proportions for the Dutch doos of Group 1 resemble the
proportions for the French boîte of Group 2 more than they
resemble the other groups of their own language. Table 5 is
a clear demonstration of the complexity of within-language
and cross-linguistic variation in categorization patterns.

The sampling procedure was repeated for the two
language groups together, that is, drawing 10,000 random
samples of 25 participants out of the complete set for both
languages together. The split-half reliability is 0.904 for all
category pairs (doos-boîte, fles-bouteille, and pot-pot). One
would expect that adding another language group to the
dataset adds considerable variability to the data. Therefore,
reliability should show a notable decrease in comparison
with the reliability calculated within a language group
(Table 4, first column). However, the reliability calculated
over language groups is only slightly lower compared to the
reliability calculated within one language group. This
finding suggests that the within-language variability is
comparable to the cross-linguistic variation.
Describing the identified variability between latent groups
of categorizers in terms of differences in criteria and degree
can be done both within and between languages. The
strength of the correlations between categorization
proportions can be interpreted as the extent to which
different criteria are used. Differences in means between
categorization proportions reflect a difference in degree.
The correlations in Table 5 vary from 0.20 to 0.86.
Within-language correlations are displayed in the light gray
area, and cross-language correlations are displayed in the
dark gray area. The mixture analyses indeed succeeded in
separating maximally different groups within one language,
since the highest correlation between the categorization
proportions of two groups of the same language is 0.77. It is
quite striking that the correlations found for latent groups

0.818
0.772
0.757

Taking into account differences in degree makes the
comparison even more complex, since the strength of the
correlation is not related to whether or not there is a
difference in means. For example, comparing the average
categorization proportions of D1 with those of F1 results in
t(39) = -4.7616, p < 0.0001, whereas the comparison D2 –
F3 results in t(39) = 0.3549, p = 0.7246. Both show a clear
difference in criteria, but only the former shows a
significant difference in degree. Of the groups that show a
better correspondence in the used criteria, comparing the
average categorization proportions of D3 and F3 shows no
degree difference (t(39) = -0.1741, p = 0.8627), whereas the
comparison D1-F2 does (t(39) = -5.843, p < 0.0001).
Similar observations can be made for the comparison of
latent groups of the same language.
Drawing a straightforward conclusion regarding crosslinguistic differences becomes more complex if one takes
into account that there are latent groups that show higher
correspondence with latent groups of another language
group than they do with latent groups of the same language.
Averaging over latent groups will in this case distort the
comparison on a cross-linguistic level. This applies for both
differences in criteria and degree.

Conclusion and discussion
The purpose of this study was to evaluate cross-linguistic
lexical categorization differences relative to the
categorization differences that exist between latent groups
within each language. When comparing the variability
displayed in Figure 1 versus Figures 2 and 3, the degree of
variability within a language is higher than expected. One
would expect the variability within a language to be less
pronounced in comparison to cross-linguistic differences.
Non-linguistic appreciation of properties of domains seems

1959

to be universal (at least for some domains, including the one
studied here), but the relation of this non-linguistic
understanding to linguistic categorization is complex. That
is, linguistic categories do not map directly onto similarity
clusters (Malt et al., 1999). These complex patterns of
lexical variation for categories of everyday objects emerge
not only between languages but within a language as well.
Especially the latter differences seem to be more complex
than earlier assumed. Vagueness in degree and criteria seem
to cause complex patterns of lexical variation between latent
groups of categorizers that resemble the patterns of lexical
variation at a cross-linguistic level.
The amount of variability observed within one language
poses a challenge for cross-linguistic research. It is common
practice in cross-linguistic research not to take into account
within-language differences and to average across all
individuals within a language, provided the sample comes
from a restricted geographic region, implying a shared
dialect. This may lead to conclusions that do not hold for the
latent groups a language might harbor. For example, based
on Figure 1 one might believe that the difference between
the categories doos and boîte mainly consists of a difference
in degree. The correlation of 0.78 between the language
groups is imperfect but points out that there is a substantial
agreement between both language groups as well. However,
taking into account the within-language differences, it
becomes clear that this conclusion could vary a great deal
depending on the combination of latent groups, since these
correlations vary from 0.20 till 0.86.
Future research will pinpoint possible causes for the
observed variation. A possible path involves relating
personal characteristics (age, gender, education level) and
item characteristics to the parameter estimates of the
different latent groups.
How are we able to manage the considerable interindividual differences during the communication process
and prevent a breakdown in communication? Possible
answers to this question may lie in the way polysemy or
words with new meanings such as eponyms are dealt with
during communication using processes of sense creation and
selection (Clark & Gerrig, 1983; Foraker & Murphy, 2012).
Even for common nouns, referring to familiar objects in
their most literal sense, these processes are relevant in the
context of inter-individual differences.
