from individual participant’s estimates for each event pair. The quantum model predicts that these identities should have a value
of 0 when events A and B are compatible; when events are incompatible the quantum model predicts that most identities will
have a value of zero, but some pairs of identities will have opposite signs (one positive, one negative) . The probability theory
