Shea, Wright, Wulf, & Whitacre, 2010; Wesch, Law, &
Hall, 2007; Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 2002). The current
general belief is that observing a coping model (someone
who gradually improves throughout the video) is more
effective than observing a mastery model (a perfect example
of someone performing a task) which on its turn is more
effective than no model. For example, this effect was found
in a study by Kitsantas, Zimmerman, and Cleary (2000). In
their study, teenage girls were taught how to play darts by
either watching a coping model, a mastery model or no
model at all. The girls, who had never played darts before,
significantly benefited from observing a model.
Additionally, the girls who had observed the coping model
outperformed the girls who had observed the mastery model
on dart-throwing skills. Furthermore, they found that the
girls in the coping model condition had more confidence in
themselves, were more satisfied with their results, showed
more pleasure and interest in dart-throwing, and attributed
fewer of the errors to lack of ability, effort, and practice than
the girls in the mastery model condition, who scored better
than the girls in the no model condition. A possible
explanation for the differences between the outcomes in the
coping and mastery model is that a coping model provides
more information about strategy implementation and error
correction than a mastery model does (Zimmerman &
Kitsantas, 2002). Kitsantas, et al. (2002) also found an effect
of social feedback: participants being told by the
experimenter when their technique was correct. Social
feedback enhanced the girls' dart-throwing skill as well as
their self-efficacy beliefs and self-reaction scores. The
effects of modeling and social feedback were additive, since
social feedback was equally effective with all modeling
groups and no interactions were found.

Abstract
In this study we investigate the effect of modeling type and
reflection on the acquisition of dart-throwing skills, selfefficacy beliefs and self-reaction scores by replicating a study
by Kitsantas, Zimmerman, and Cleary (2000). Participants
observing a coping model were expected to surpass
participants observing a mastery model who in turn were
expected to outperform participants who learned without a
model. Reflection was hypothesized to have a positive effect.
Ninety undergraduate students were tested three times on
dart-throwing skills, self-efficacy beliefs, and self-reaction
scores. Contrary to what was expected, we found no main
effects of modeling type and reflection. No interaction effects
were found either. There was an effect of trial, indicating that
participants improved dart-throwing skills, self-efficacy
beliefs, and self-reaction scores over time. Furthermore, selfefficacy beliefs and dart-throwing skill were highly
correlated. Our results suggest that learners do not benefit
from observing a model and reflecting, but practice makes
perfect.

Introduction
The ability to learn from observing others is a key
constituent of human social cognition. Observational
learning is the process of learning a new task by watching
and/or listening how someone else performs this task. It
relies on multiple functions: learners should be able to infer
others’ intentions from action observation, process others’
action outcomes (i.e. successes and errors) and combine
these sources of information in order to select behaviors
leading to desired outcomes later on (e.g. Monfardini, et al.,
2013; Rak, Bellebaum, & Thoma, 2013).
Various studies have shown the effectiveness of
observational learning in different domains, such as writing
(Braaksma, Rijlaarsdam, Van den Bergh, 2002), creative
design (Groenendijk, Janssen, Rijlaarsdam, & Van den
Bergh, 2013) and motor skill acquisition (Kitsantas,
Zimmerman, & Cleary, 2000). A possible explanation for
these successes is that the cognitive effort is shifted from
executing certain tasks to learning (Braaksma et al., 2002).

Reflection
In most studies on observational learning, learning through
modeling is compared with learning without a model, often
referred to as ‘learning-by-doing’. In learning-by-doing,
learners put their own knowledge and beliefs on how a
certain task should be done into practice, without observing
someone else performing the task. They learn by
recognizing and adapting to their own trials and errors
(Bandura, 1977). The main difference between
observational learning and learning-by-doing is the absence
of a model in the latter. However, closer inspection of the
methods suggests that there might be a confounding factor;

Modeling Type
Previous research has shown that within observational
learning the type of model can influence the learning
process (Braaksma, Rijlaarsdam, & Van Den Bergh, 2002;

99

reflection. Reflection plays an important role within
observational learning; the observer watches a model and
transfers the provided information to his/her own
acquisition by judging which parts could be beneficial and
how he/she could use them. In observational learning,
reflection is often encouraged by asking participants
questions about the model’s performance. In learning-bydoing, reflection is not an intrinsic part of the process and
thus, reflection does not automatically take place and is
often not encouraged within research. Adding reflection to
learning-by-doing could therefore make these two types of
learning more comparable.
This raises the question whether reflection could account
for the differences found between observational learning
and learning-by-doing. Reflection within observational
learning has been studied by Braaksma, et al. (2002). In
their experiment participants observed two models
performing a writing task. One group started with the
writing task immediately after the observation, whereas two
other groups reflected upon the models. Both reflection
groups outperformed the no reflection group on the writing
tasks. However, this was not compared to learning-bydoing.
Additionally, the influence of reflection on learning in
general has been studied. Reflection is found to be
beneficial under certain circumstances (see i.e. Bulman &
Schutz, 2013; Moon, 2004). Learners can be asked to
monitor or record their performances during their learning
process. They note their results and/or their own perception
on the cause of success or failure. This process is said to
enable a learner to detect, attribute and correct their errors
(Ferrari, 1996; Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 2002).

beliefs, and self-reaction scores than not observing a model
(H1a) and that observing a coping model leads to better
acquisition of a novice motor skill, self-efficacy beliefs and
self-reaction scores than observing a mastery model (H1b).
Secondly, based on earlier findings concerning the
influence of reflection (e.g. Braaksma, et al., 2002; Bulman
& Schutz, 2013), we expect reflection to lead to better
acquisition of a novice motor skill, self-efficacy beliefs and
self-reaction scores than no reflection (H2)
Thirdly, we hypothesize that reflection reduces the effect
of modeling type on the acquisition of a novice motor skill,
self-efficacy beliefs and self-reaction scores (H3).

Method
Participants
Ninety undergraduate students at a Dutch University
participated in this study. Six participants were removed
because they had played darts more than twice in the last six
months even though participants were informed about this
restriction. This resulted in a sample of 84 participants, of
whom 24 were male and 60 were female. The mean age was
21.4 years (SD = 3.27) and 82 participants indicated to have
played darts once or zero times in the last six months. All
participants were right-handed in order for the instruction
videos to be accurate and useful.

Design
A 3 x 2 design was used in this experiment, with modeling
type (coping model, mastery model and no model) and
reflection (yes or no) as the independent variables. This
resulted in six conditions to which the 84 participants were
randomly assigned. In line with Kitsantas et al. (2000) all
participants were tested on dart-throwing skills, self-efficacy
and self-reaction. Whereas Kitsantas et al. (2000) measured
these variables once, we did this in three trials within the
experiment: at the start of the experiment, after the
experimental treatment, and after a ten-minute practice
session in order to detect possible improvements as a result
of instructions, modeling, and/or practice.

Current Study
The common belief in educational research seems to be that
both observational learning and reflection have a positive
effect on learning. Additionally, the type of model within
observational learning seems be of influence. However, how
reflection interacts with observational learning is not clear
yet. This raises the question whether reflection causes the
differences between observational learning and learning-by
doing and whether these differences can still be found when
reflection is added to learning-by-doing. To study this we
will attempt to replicate the previously mentioned study by
Kitsantas, et al. (2000) in which the influence of modeling
type and social feedback on the acquisition of dart skills was
investigated. In this study we will however replace social
feedback with reflection. Since Kitsantas, et al. (2002)
found no interaction between modeling type and social
feedback, we do not expect the replacement of social
feedback with reflection to influence the effect of modeling
type.
In line with Kitsantas, et al. (2000) we hypothesize that
modeling type influences the acquisition of a novice motor
skill, self-efficacy beliefs and self-reaction scores (H1).
More specifically, we expect that observing a model leads to
better acquisition of a novice motor skill, self-efficacy

Material
Identical to the study by Kitsantas, et al. (2000), a dart board
with regular concentric circles was used instead of a regular
dart board. In the study by Kitsantas, et al (2000) the dart
board had seven circles, with each circle having a width of
2.54 centimeter, whereas in this study, the circles had the
exact same width, but the dart board consisted of nine
circles instead of seven. The dartboard was positioned at the
official distance of 2.37 meters of the throwing line and with
the bull’s-eye at a height of 1.73 meters from the ground.
Six regular darts were given to the participants in order for
them to make six consecutive throws in the tests.
Two different videos were recorded, one of a coping
model playing darts (see Figure 1) and one of a mastery

100

models playing darts. The same model was used in both
videos. In the coping model condition, the model started out
by making several errors in his dart-throwing technique.
These errors were made by not following the instructions to
dart-throwing that were used, for instance by holding the
dart with all five fingers instead of the three mentioned in
the instruction. The model commented on his own
performance and gradually improved his dart-throwing
skills. In the mastery model video, the model started out
with a flawless technique and good skills, and maintained
this throughout the video. A right-handed model was used.
In order to transfer the model’s performance to the
participants, all participants were right-handed, otherwise
interpretational errors might have occurred. Participants
were shown one of the videos if they were in a coping
model or mastery model condition and after they had read
the instructions.
An online question form was created in order to collect all
scores. Participants were seated at a desk with a laptop on
which the question form was presented to them and they
could independently fill in the questions. All scores were
collected and stored in an online database.

Procedure
Participants were individually taken into a room. First they
filled in a consent form, a form with demographic
information, and they performed a baseline test in which
their self-efficacy, dart-throwing skills, and self-reaction
were measured. Within this test, participants first filled in an
online form with the question about self-efficacy, then they
threw six consecutive darts, and after throwing the darts,
they answered the self-reaction question.
As a next step, they were given the instructions to dart
throwing on paper. The participants were asked to study
these for a few minutes, until they felt confident that they
knew what to do. After having read the instruction, the
procedure depended on the condition participants were
assigned to.
No model, no reflection Participants were tested again
straight after reading the instructions. Then, they got to
practice dart throwing for 10 minutes.
Coping model, no reflection Participants were shown a
video of a dart-thrower who started out by making certain
mistakes, but significantly improved over the rounds, the
model threw 15 darts in total. After having watched the
video, the participants performed the same test again, thus,
their self-efficacy, dart-throwing skills, and self-reaction
were measured. Then, they got to practice dart throwing for
10 minutes.
Mastery model, no reflection Participants were shown a
video of a dart-thrower who made 15 good throws. After
having watched the video, the participants performed the
same test again, thus, their self-efficacy, dart-throwing
skills, and self-reaction were measured. Then, they got to
practice dart throwing for 10 minutes.
No model, with reflection Participants were asked to make
their first fifteen practice throws. After that, they were asked
to reflect upon their own performance according to the five
basic skills (grip, stance, sighting, throw, and follow
through). After the reflection, they were tested on selfefficacy, dart-throwing skills, and self-reaction and are free
to continue practicing afterwards. Because, the practice time
had to be equal across all conditions, the duration of the first
fifteen throws of the participants in the no model, with
reflections group, was part of their total ten minutes of
practice. Thus, if a participant performed his/her first fifteen
throws in three minutes, he/she had an additional seven
minutes to practice after the reflection.
Coping model, with reflection After having read the
instructions, participants were shown a video of a dartthrower who started out by making certain mistakes, but
significantly improves over the rounds, the model threw 15
darts in total. Participants were asked to reflect on the model
on the aspects explained in the instruction and to report the
improvements to be made. After having watched the entire
video, they were provided with a form with the five basic
skills (grip, stance, sighting, throw, and follow through) as a
memory aid. Participants were asked to reflect upon all of
these items and write down as much as they remembered.
After having watched the video and having reflected on the

Measures
Dart-throwing skills These were measured by adding up
the points for all six consecutive throws. The minimum
score per dart was zero and the maximum score was ten.
Dart-throwing skill was measured in all three trials. The
average dart-throwing score per dart was calculated by
dividing the total score by six.
Self-efficacy Before each dart-throwing test, participants
were asked how confident they felt that they could (1) throw
9 points with one dart, (2) throw 7 points with one dart, (3)
throw 5 points with one dart, and (4) throw 3 points with
one dart. Their scores were measured on a scale from 0 to
100 with 10-point intervals, with 0 being not sure and 100
being very sure. This self-efficacy measure was used
because the same measure was used by Kitsantas, et al.
(2000), with a minor change because of the difference in
dart boards. For all three trials, the average score of these
four questions was used as their self-efficacy score.
Self-reaction Participants scored their satisfaction with their
own performance per test on a 0 to 100 scale for all three
trials, with 0 being not satisfied and 100 being very
satisfied. As with the self-efficacy measure, this
measurement is identical to that of Kitsantas, et al. (2000).

models performance, the participants performed the same
test again, thus, their self-efficacy, dart-throwing skills, and
self-reaction was measured. Then, they got to practice dart
throwing for 10 minutes.
Mastery model, with reflection After having read the
instructions, participants were shown a video of a dartthrower who made 15 good throws. They were asked to
judge the model on the aspects explained in the instruction
and to report the improvements to be made. After having
watched the entire video, they were provided with a form
with the five basic skills (grip, stance, sighting, throw, and
follow through) as a memory aid. Participants were asked to
reflect upon all of these items and write down as much as
they remembered. After having watched the video and
having reflected on the models performance, the participants
performed the same test again, thus, their self-efficacy, dartthrowing skills, and self-reaction were measured. Then, they
got to practice dart throwing for 10 minutes.
After the ten-minute practice, all participants were tested
for one last time.

[4.65 , 5.61]) and learning-by-doing (M = 4.80, C.I. [4.28 ,
5.32]), this effect did not yield significance.
Reflection was discovered not to have a significant main
effect on dart-throwing skill either, F (1,78) = 0.88, p = .35.
No reflection even led to numerically higher scores on dartthrowing skills (M = 5.29, C.I. [4.89 , 5.70]) than reflection
(M = 5.03, C.I. [4.64 , 5.42]), even though this difference
was not significant.
In addition, none of the interaction effects were found to
be significant (Fs < 1.52, ps > .2).

Self-efficacy
A main effect of trials on self-efficacy was found, F (1.80,
135.10) = 145.52, p < .01. Self-efficacy scores on the first
test (M = 36.86, CI [33.37 , 40.36]), the second test (M =
49.77, CI [45.92 , 53.62]), and the third test (M = 61.10, CI
[57.20 , 64.99]) were significantly different. All the
individual differences were significantly different at a pvalue of < .01.
The main effect of modeling type did not yield
significance, F (2,75) = 2.10, p = .13. Again, the data
numerically suggest that best results are obtained by
observing a mastery model (M = 53.45, CI [47.82, 59.07]),
followed by observing a coping model (M = 49.44, CI
[43.72 , 55.17]) and learning-by-doing (M = 44.84, CI
[38.66 , 51.02]). However, this effect failed to reach
significance.
The main effect of reflection was not found to be
significant either, F (1,75) = 3.40, p = .07. Similar to the
effect of reflection on dart-throwing skills, the data
numerically suggest that best results are obtained by not
reflecting (M = 52.37, CI [47.62 , 57.12]) instead of
reflecting (M = 46.12, CI [41.32 , 50.92]).
Again, no significant interaction effects were found (Fs <
1.37, ps > .26).

Analysis
The data were analyzed with a 3 (type of modeling) x 2
(level of reflection) repeated measures multivariate analysis
of variance, with dart-throwing skills, self-efficacy, and
self-reaction as dependent measures. A repeated measures
ANOVA was conducted in order to discover the changes in
the dependent scores over the three trials that were
conducted within the experiment. Mauchly’s test for
sphericity was used to test for homogeneity of variance, and
when this test was significant we applied a GreenhouseGeisser correction on the degrees of freedom.

Results
An overview of the mean scores and standard deviations for
all three trials in all six groups are shown in Table 1.

Self-reaction
The results for self-reaction were very similar to those of
self-efficacy. A significant main effect of trial on selfreaction scores was found, F (2, 156) = 4.56, p = .01. Again,
the scores on the first test (M = 65.93, CI [61.84 , 70.02]),
were significantly different from scores on the second test
(M = 59.24, CI [54.74 , 63.74]) and the third test (M =
67.02, CI [62.53 , 71.52]). The difference between the first
test and the second test (M = 6.69, CI [0.89 , 12.48], p =
.02), and that between the second test and the third test (M =
-7.78, CI [-13.53 , -2.03], p = .01) were significant. The
difference between the first and the third test, however, did
not turn out to be significant (M = -1.09, CI [-6.18 , 3.99], p
= .67).
No significant main effect of modeling type, (F (2,78) =
1.61, p = .21) or reflection (F (1,78) = 0.58, p = .45) was
found, indicating that learning-by-doing (M = 60.33, CI [
54.91, 65.75]), observing a mastery model (M = 66.79, CI

Dart-throwing skills
A within-subjects main effect of trials was found for dartthrowing skills (F (2,156) = 32.96, p < .01), with the mean
scores gradually increasing each trial (Mtrial1 = 4.63, C.I.
[4.26 , 5.00], Mtrial2 = 4.91, C.I. [4.55 , 5.26], Mtrail3 = 5.94,
C.I. [5.64 , 6.24]). The difference between trial 1 and 3 (M =
-1.31) was significant, p < .01, CI [-1.73 , -.89] and so was
the difference between trial 2 and 3 (M = -1.03), p < .01, CI
[-1.46 , -.61]). However, the difference between trial 1 and
2 (M = -.28) turns out not to be significant, p = .29, CI [-.68
, .13].
No significant main effect of modeling type on dartthrowing skills was found, F (2,78) = 2.33, p = .10. Even
though the data numerically suggest that best results are
obtained by observing a mastery model (M = 5.55, C.I.
[5.08 , 6.02]), followed by a coping model ((M = 5.13, C.I.

General Discussion and Conclusion
The aim of this study was to determine what the effects of
modeling type and reflection are on the acquisition of dartthrowing skills, self-efficacy beliefs and self-reaction
scores. First of all, modeling type was expected to have an
effect, with participants observing a coping model
surpassing participants observing a mastery model who in
turn were expected to outperform participants who learn
without observing a model. Even though we found
numerical differences between the modeling type
conditions, with participants in the mastery condition
scoring higher on dart-throwing skills, self-efficacy and
self-reaction scores, than participants in the coping model
condition, who on their turn scored higher than the
participants in the no model condition, these differences
were not significant. This indicates that in this study it did
not matter if the learner observed a coping model, a mastery
model, or no model at all. This was the case for dartthrowing skill, self-efficacy beliefs and self-reaction scores.
Thus, in this study we found no support for H1a and H1b:
observing a model did not lead to a better learning process
than not observing a model, and observing a coping model
did not lead to a better learning process then observing a
mastery model, which is not in line with what was found by
Kitsantas et al. (2000).
Similar results were found for reflection. We expected
reflection to have a positive effect, but we found no
significant effects for reflection. The no reflection group
even scored numerically higher than the reflection group.
Thus, in this study H2 was not supported: reflection did not
lead to a better learning process than no reflection.
No interaction effects were found either. It was
hypothesized that reflection would reduce the difference
between observational learning and learning-by-doing (H3),
but as no such effect was found, reflection could not
influence this effect. In addition, no other interaction effects
between number of trials, modeling type, reflection were

Correlations
To further explore the relationships between dart-throwing
skills, self-efficacy and self-reaction, we used a Pearson’s
correlation test. In the first trial the results show a strong
correlation between self-efficacy and dart-throwing skills,
r(81) = .60, p < .01., and a medium strong correlation
between self-reaction and dart-throwing skills, r(84) =
.47, p < .01. The correlation between self-efficacy and selfreaction was less strong, but still significant, r(81) = .25, p <
.05.
For the second trial, again the correlation between selfefficacy and dart-throwing skills, r(81) = .52, p < .01., and
the correlation between self-reaction and dart-throwing
skills, r(84) = .49, p < .01.are significant and of medium
strength. However, the correlation between self-efficacy and
self-reaction is not significant and weak in this second test.
The correlation scores of the dependent variables on the
third trial show that self-efficacy and dart-throwing
skill, r(81) = .41, p < .01. and self-reaction and dartthrowing skill, r(84) = .67, p < .01. are again strongly
connected, whereas a weaker, but significant connection can
be observed between self-efficacy and self-reaction, r(81) =
.15, p < .05.

found on dart-throwing skills, self-efficacy beliefs, or selfreaction scores.
It was however found that dart-skills and self-efficacy
beliefs significantly improved with each trial. Thus, our data
suggest that it did not matter how someone was taught how
to play darts, as long as they practiced, their scores
improved and they felt more confident. Additionally, dartthrowing skills and self-efficacy beliefs were highly
correlated, meaning that how higher the self-efficacy beliefs
of a person were, the higher their dart-throwing score was.
In the current study we were not able to replicate the
findings by Kitsantas, et al. (2000) who found very clear
effects of modeling type. Our test was sufficiently powered:
the sample was larger than in Kitsantas et al. (respectively
90 and 60) and the test was sensitive enough to find
statistical differences for trial, indicating that the
participants did learn from the interventions. The question
that can be raised therefore is why there are such substantial
differences between the findings of this study and that of
Kitsantas, et al. (2000).
Perhaps the change in population contributes to the
differences between the current study and the Kitsantas et
al. study. Whereas Kitsantas, et al. made use of 14 to 16
year old girls, both male and female students with an
average age of 21.4 years were used as participants in this
study. Because of the higher age, it is plausible that our
participants have watched someone else play darts before,
either on television or in real life. This observational
experience could lead to them not being so inexperienced.
Lee and White (1990) discovered that participants who
merely observed someone performing a certain motor task,
acquired some amount of skill themselves. Thus,
participants who have taken part in the present study might
unconsciously have been more experienced than expected.
The girls in the Kitsantas, et al. study (2000) had never
played darts before. Our participants were more likely to
have played darts before. We tried to control for this by
using a dart-experience restriction. Since the majority of the
participants had played darts once or more, we made a post
hoc distinction between the participants who had never
played darts (N = 32) and the ones who had played (N =
52). The repeated measures multivariate analyses of
variance was run again, but now split in two separate
groups, the group with no experience at all and the one with
some experience. The analysis with the average number of
point as the repeated measures variable showed no
significant results for either group. Thus, even in the no
experience group, no effects of modeling type or reflection
were found. The same can be said for the analyses with selfefficacy and self-reaction as the repeated measures. The
outcomes of those analyses were not found to be significant
either.
In sum, the results of Kitsantas, et al. (2000) were not
replicated in this study, even though the experimental
procedures and measurements were very similar. Learners
did not benefit from observing a model or reflecting.
However, they did improve by practicing. The results of this

study are also not in line with earlier findings by Braaksma,
et al. (2002), Ferrari (1996), Shea, et al. (2010), Wesch, et
al. (2007), and Zimmerman and Kitsantas (2002). Our
results indicate that the effects of observational learning and
the role of reflection are still not clear and therefore more
research into this subject is needed.
