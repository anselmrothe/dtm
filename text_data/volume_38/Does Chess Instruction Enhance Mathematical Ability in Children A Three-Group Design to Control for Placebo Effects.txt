nately, this study did not control for possible placebo effects.
   In any case, since metacognitive skills have been claimed
to be one of the most important predictors of mathematical
ability (Desoete & Roeyers, 2003; Veenman, Van Hout-
Wolters, & Afflerbach, 2006), and since playing chess is an
activity for which the self-monitoring of one’s thinking pro-
cesses is essential (De Groot, 1965), Kazemi et al.’s (2012)
hypothesis is plausible. Obviously, the null hypothesis – i.e.,
chess instruction has no effect on children’s mathematical
and/or cognitive abilities, and the observed benefits are mar-
ginal and only due to placebo effects – may be valid too.
   Since there is a need, in this field of research, to clarify
whether the observed positive influence of chess practice is
due to placebo effects or to chess training itself, we ran a
three-group design study. Beyond the usual experimental and
control groups – attending a chess course and regular school
activities, respectively – an active control group was added to
control for potential placebo effects. Moreover, the partici-
pants of this study were given – along with a test of mathe-
matical ability – a questionnaire assessing metacognitive
skills, in order to evaluate whether metacognition is the link
connecting chess instruction to the improvements in mathe-
matical ability, as proposed by several authors in the field.
   This work thus investigates (a) whether chess instruction
enhances children’s mathematical ability, (b) whether this ef-
fect is mediated by metacognition, and (c) whether the effect
of chess instruction on the above two variables is genuine or
