Interactivity in Science Inquiry
The prior research on interactivity raises a question of how
those findings apply to science simulations which typically
provide individuals with a fair amount of freedom to
conduct science inquiry. In particular, one of the distinctive
features of simulation-based science assessments is that they
allow test-takers to collect their own data for scientific
hypothesis testing. Test-takers can make their own decisions
on various aspects of data collection such as how much data
to collect and how exhaustively to search the experimental
space. This contrasts to traditional assessments in which
test-takers are typically asked to draw a conclusion based on
the data prepared by assessment developers.
   Collection of adequate data is one of the critical inquiry
skills involved in scientific investigations (Kuhn, Schauble,
& Garcia-Mila, 1992). Prior research found that people                          Figure 1. Concentration simulation.
often exhibit suboptimal data collection behaviors. For
instance, people often jump to a conclusion based on limited
observations without sufficiently sampling variables
(Harrison & Schunn, 2004; Kuhn et al., 1992). To
understand how simulation interactivity impacts data
collection behaviors and inquiry outcomes, we manipulated
the design of slider/button controls in a chemistry
simulation. While there is a fair amount of human-computer
interaction research on how design of slider controls
impacts user behaviors (e.g., Roster, Lucianetti, & Albaum,
                                                                    Figure 2. Variable-setting controls in the low (left) and high
