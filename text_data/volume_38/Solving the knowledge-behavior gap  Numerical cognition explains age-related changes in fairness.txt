Abstract
Young children share fairly and expect others to do the same.
Yet little is known about the underlying cognitive
mechanisms that support fairness. Across two experiments,
we investigated whether children’s numerical competencies
are linked with their sharing behavior. Preschoolers (aged
2.5-5.5) participated in either third-party (Experiment 1) or
first-party (Experiment 2) resource allocation tasks.
Children’s numerical competence was then assessed using the
Give-N-Task (Sarnecka & Carey, 2008; Wynn, 1990).
Numerical competence – specifically knowledge of the
cardinal principle explained age-related changes in fair
sharing in both the third- and first-party contexts. These
results suggest that an understanding of the cardinal principle
serves as an important mechanism for fair sharing behavior.

Introduction
By the preschool age, young children show a remarkable
concern for fairness. This concern appears in their explicit
endorsements of fairness as a social norm (Damon, 1977;
Smith, Blake, & Harris, 2013), in their affective responses
towards inequalities (LoBue, Nishida, Chiong, DeLoache, &
Haidt, 2011), and in their own distribution of resources
(Olson & Spelke, 2008). By middle childhood, children go
to great lengths to be fair and to appear fair to others, even
in third-party contexts, in which they presumably have no
stake: they discard resources in order to avoid inequalities
(Shaw & Olson, 2012) and they spontaneously correct an
adult’s unequal distribution of resources (Paulus, Gillis, Li,
& Moore, 2013). Thus, children show sufficient motivation
to share at an early age – they recognize what fairness is and
understand why it is important.
In spite of their interest in fairness, it is remarkable that
many children do not typically behave fairly themselves
(Blake, McAuliffe, & Warneken, 2014; Sheskin, Chevallier,
Lambert, & Baumard, 2014). Prior work has consistently
documented that fair sharing emerges late in the preschool
period and into middle childhood (e.g., Fehr, Ernst, &
Rockenbach, 2008). As such, researchers have recently
begun to become interested in what is now termed the
“knowledge-behavior gap”: although young children
recognize situations that are fair or unfair (Schmidt &

Sommerville, 2012; Sloane, Baillargeon, & Premack, 2011),
they do not always behave fairly themselves (see Smith et
al., 2013). Why children show a knowledge-behavior gap
has been of recent theoretical interest (e.g., Blake et al.,
2014). In our work, we explore one possibility: the extent to
which children’s understanding of number underpins their
abilities to share fairly with others.
Sharing is inherently a number-based problem. In order to
understand how six candies should be shared between three
people, one should understand that 6 divided by 3 results in
2 candies each. Similarly, a division is unfair if it does not
show cardinal equivalence – if, for example, one person had
3 candies, and another received 1. Such simple numerical
calculations underlie our understanding of higher-order
concepts such as fairness, equality, and generosity. In spite
of the clear connection between sharing and numerical
cognition, few studies have charted how number knowledge
might relate to children’s resource distribution.
Several earlier findings suggest that numerical cognition
and sharing are, in fact, related: First, older work has found
that in middle childhood, children come to understand
concepts of division through the action schema of sharing
(Correa, Nunes, & Bryant, 1998; Desforges & Desforges,
1980; Frydman & Bryant, 1988; Squire & Bryant, 2002a;
2002b). That is, children find division problems easier when
they are presented with the end goal of sharing resources
fairly (e.g., “How many candies are in each box?”) than
when the end goal is to figure out the number of recipients
present during fair sharing (e.g., “How many boxes did we
use?”). Second, as compared with older children, younger
children, with presumably limited numeracy skills, have a
harder time splitting resources fairly and fail to recognize
the connection between sharing and cardinal equivalence
(e.g., don’t recall correctly that each recipient has the same
amount; Frydman & Bryant, 1988; see also Pepper &
Hunting, 1998).
The converging evidence suggests that numerical
competencies might be one cognitive prerequisite to fair
sharing. Thus, although children may be able to recognize
fair sharing from a young age, they do not yet possess the
requisite numerical skills to produce fair shares. In our
studies, we looked at the relationship between children’s
sharing behavior and numerical cognition.

1607

In our first experiment, we began by looking at young
children’s sharing behavior in a third-party context (i.e.,
sharing between two recipients when there is no cost to the
self). In the second, we looked at a more stringent test of
fair sharing: sharing in a first-party context, in which
children shared between themselves and another recipient.
Across both experiments, we also assessed children’s
numerical understanding using a version of the Give-N task
(Sarnecka & Carey, 2008; Wynn, 1992), used to classify
young children according to whether they know and
understand the cardinal principle (i.e., that the purpose of
counting is to determine to cardinality of a set).

Experiment 1
Participants
Seventy-three children (28 male, 45 female) were tested at a
local children’s museum or during a laboratory visit (Mean
age=3y;8m, Range = 2y;6m–5y;6m). Nineteen additional
children were excluded due to experimenter error (n = 5),
parental/sibling interference (n = 7), failure to complete the
task (n = 3), or due to no video (either recording error or
lack of parental consent to video record; n = 5).

Procedure

Give-N Task Following the two resource sharing tasks,
each child completed a version of the Give-N task (Sarnecka
& Carey, 2008; Wynn, 1990, 1992) to determine whether
the child understood the cardinal principle (that the purpose
of counting is to determine the number of items in a set).
Children were given a set (approximately 10 ducks) and a
blue basket (a “pond”). They were then asked to place N
ducks “into the pond” (basket), in which N varied from 1-6.
On every trial, after responding, children were asked “Is that
N ducks?” and were allowed to change their response if they
wanted. The experimenter first asked for 1 duck and
continued to 3 if the child correctly placed 1 duck into the
pond. The experimenter then continued to ask for N+1 if the
child successfully placed N ducks into the pond or for N-1 if
the child failed to place N ducks into the pond. The
experiment concluded after the child either (a) had two
successes on N and two failures on N+1, or (b) succeeded
twice on N = 6 ducks. Following prior procedures (LeCorre
& Carey, 2007), children were classified as either Subset
Knowers (children who could count properly up to a
specific subset of under 6 items but no more, and thus failed
to understand that the purpose of counting is to determine
cardinality; n = 42) or Cardinal Principle (CP) Knowers
(proficient counters; n = 31).

Results

Materials In the resource distribution tasks, we used four
plush animals (hedgehog, panda, dog, and elephant), four
wooden boxes – one for each puppet with pictures of the
puppet on the tops and insides, and 10 small dinosaur toys.
Materials for the Give-N task were a set of small yellow
rubber ducks and a blue basket used to symbolize a pond.
Resource Distribution Tasks Children were presented with
two trials: one in which they were presented with Four
Resources and one in which they were presented with Six
Resources (order counterbalanced). In each trial, the child
was introduced to two puppets in succession (e.g., “Doggie”
and “Ellie”) and a set of dinosaur toys (either four or six).
The researcher arranged the toys linearly between the two
puppets and pointed to each toy in turn without any verbal
counting. The researcher then placed two wooden boxes in
front of the puppets and told the child that s/he would get to
split the toys between the puppets: “You get to decide which
toys to give to [Recipient 1] and which ones to give to
[Recipient 2]. So whichever toys you want to give to
[Recipient 1], you can put right here [point to Recipient 1’s
box], and whichever ones you want to give to [Recipient 2],
you can put right here [point to Recipient 2’s box]”.
Children who left any toys on the table were re-prompted
(“And what do you want to do with these?”) until all toys
were placed into the boxes. Children were asked additional
follow-up questions regarding their memory of the number
of resources they shared and sharing justifications (not
further discussed or analyzed here).

Our first question concerned whether there were age-related
differences in fair sharing (defined as an equal split between
the two animals). We ran a binary logistic regression using
age, gender, and trial type (four vs. six; entered as a withinsubjects effect) as the predictors and likelihood of fair
sharing as the response (Model 1; see Table 1). There was a
significant effect of Age, B = 0.92, SE(B) = 0.30, 95%CI =
0.34–1.50, Wald(1) = 9.60, p = .002, with older children
being more likely to share fairly. Additionally, there was
also a significant effect of Gender (with females sharing
more fairly than males), B = 1.27, SE(B) = 0.44, 95%CI =
0.40–2.13, Wald(1) = 8.18, p = .004, and no effect of Trial
Type, p = 0.83. Therefore, as children aged, they became
more likely to share fairly.

Our next – and focal – research question was whether
children’s acquisition of cardinal principle (CP knowledge)
might explain age-related differences in fair sharing. We
first tested whether CP knowledge related to fair sharing. To
investigate whether CP knowledge predicted fair sharing,
we re-ran Model 1, but used CP knowledge (CP knowers vs.
subset knowers, coded as 1 and 0 respectively) instead of
age as a predictor (Model 2). There was a significant effect
of CP Knowledge, B = 1.57, SE(B) = 0.48, 95%CI = 0.64 –
2.50 Wald(1) = 10.92, p = .001. As with the first Model,
there was a significant effect of Gender, B = 1.13, SE(B) =
0.44, 95%CI = 0.27 – 1.98, Wald(1) = 6.62, p = .01, and no
effect of Trial Type, p = 0.83. Therefore, understanding of
the cardinal principle predicted children’s abilities to share
fairly.
We then confirmed that Age was significantly associated
with CP Knowledge, B = 2.29, SE(B) = 0.54, Wald(1) =
18.15, p = 0.00002.

Because third-party sharing involves a situation in which
there is no cost to the self and because third-party sharing is
something that even infants expect others to do (Schmidt &
Sommerville, 2012), our task was able to look at sharing
ability in a context unconfounded with potential
motivational concerns. That is, our results suggest that even
in a context in which prior has found that children are likely
motivated to share equally (e.g., Olson & Spelke, 2008),
only children who had acquired cardinality had the requisite
skills are able to do so.
In Experiment 2, we looked at a more stringent test of fair
sharing: first-party sharing. Prior work has consistently
documented age-related differences in first-party fairness
(e.g., Fehr, Bernard, Rockenbach, 2008; Smith et al., 2013),
but as with third-party fairness, the mechanism driving this
increase is not yet clear. Moreover, unlike third-party
fairness, first-party fairness requires additional cognitive
skills (e.g., inhibitory control), which develop with age
during the preschool period. We were interested in whether
numerical cognition would continue to predict fair sharing
behavior, even in a context in which fairness is costly to the
child.

Experiment 2
Participants

Figure 1: Mediation analysis in Experiment 1
As a last step, we tested whether CP knowledge mediated
the effect of age on fair sharing. Here we combined Models
1 and 2 and used both age and CP knowledge as predictors
(Model 3). With CP Knowledge added to the model, there
was a significant effect of CP Knowledge (such that CP
knowers were more likely to share fairly than subset
knowers), B = 1.10, SE(B) = 0.56, 95%CI = -0.007 – 2.20,
Wald(1) = 3.79, p = .05, and no longer any significant effect
of Age, p = 0.15. As with the previous models, there was
also a significant effect of Gender, B = 1.26, SE(B) = 0.44,
95%CI = 0.39 – 2.13, Wald(1) = 8.00, p = .005 and no
significant effect of Trial Type, p = 0.83. A formal
mediation test suggested that CP Knowledge mediated agerelated differences in fair sharing, Sobel test z = 1.79, p =
0.07 (see Figure 1). Therefore, knowledge of the cardinal
principle, and not age, predicted children’s abilities to share
fairly across both trials.

Discussion
Our results show that understanding the cardinal principle
explained age-related changes in third-party sharing,
suggesting that numerical cognition serves as an important
mechanism for fairness as children age. As children acquire
cardinality, they become more adept at social skills such as
dividing resources equally between two recipients.

Ninety-two children (37 male, 55 female) were tested at a
local children’s museum or during a laboratory visit (Mean
age = 3y;10m, Range = 2y;6m – 5y;4m)1. Eighteen
additional children were excluded due to either protocol
error (n = 2), failure to complete the task (n = 9), missing
video (either equipment failure or lack of parental consent to
video record (n = 4)), or being outside the a priori targeted
age range (n = 3).

Procedure
Materials Materials were the same as Experiment 1, with
the following modifications: (a) only one stuffed animal
recipient was used in each resource distribution trial (the
second recipient was the child), and (b) stickers instead of
dinosaur toys were used as resources.
Resource Distribution Tasks Because first-party sharing
with anonymous recipients has been shown to be
particularly difficult for preschool-aged children, we
contextualized the situation and used a modified procedure
that has been shown to successfully induce sharing in
preschoolers (Chernyak & Kushnir, 2013). Children were
introduced to a puppet that was described as feeling “very
sad”, and told that they could give him/her some stickers to
make the puppet feel better. The distribution phase

proceeded in exactly the same manner as in Experiment 1.
Children were then shown a set of linearly arranged stickers
(either four in the Four Resource Trial or six in the Six
Resource Trial; order counterbalanced) arranged linearly
between two boxes (one labeled as the puppet’s box which
had pictures of the puppet on the top and inside; and the
other labeled as the child’s box which had no pictures), and
told they could split the stickers however they wished
between themselves and the puppet.
Give-N Task After the two resource distribution tasks,
children completed a Give-N task, which proceeded in
exactly the same manner as in Experiment 1. Children were
classified as either Subset Knowers (48 children) or CP
knowers (44 children).

Results
Overall, the rates of fair sharing were lower in
Experiment 2 (first-party sharing) than in Experiment 1
(third-party sharing). A direct comparison of the proportion
of fair sharing trials across the two experiments revealed
that children were more likely to be fair in Experiment 1 (n
= 99 of 146) than in Experiment 2 (n = 103 of 184), Fisher’s
exact test, p = 0.03. Therefore, children were less likely to
be fair when sharing in a first-party context. We then asked
whether CP knowledge nonetheless continued to predict
children’s fair sharing.
As with Experiment 1, our first question concerned
whether there were age-related differences in fair sharing.
We ran a binary logistic regression using age, gender, and
trial type (four vs. six; entered as a within-subjects effect) as
the predictors and likelihood of fair sharing as the response
(Model 1; see Table 2). There was a significant effect of
Age, B = 0.84, SE(B) = 0.25, 95%CI = 0.35 – 1.34, Wald(1)
= 11.07, p = .001, a significant effect of Trial Type (with
children being more likely to share fairly in the Four
Resource trial), B = -0.88, SE(B) = 0.27, 95%CI = -1.41 - 0.35, Wald(1) = 10.72, p = .001, and no effect of Gender, p
= .26. Therefore, as children aged, they became more likely
to share fairly in a first-party context.

Our next – and focal – research question was whether
children’s CP knowledge might explain age-related
differences in fair sharing. To investigate whether CP
knowledge predicted fair sharing, we re-ran Model 1, but
used CP knowledge instead of Age as a predictor (Model 2).
Confirming the idea that acquiring cardinality predicts firstparty fairness, there was a significant effect of CP
Knowledge, B = 1.54, SE(B) = 0.39, 95%CI = 0.77 – 2.30,
Wald(1) = 15.42, p = .00008. As with the first Model, there
was a significant effect of Trial Type (with children being
more likely to share fairly in the Four Resource trial), B = 0.88, SE(B) = 0.27, 95%CI = 0.35 – 1.40, Wald(1) = 10.75,
p = .001, and a marginally significant effect of Gender (with
females being more likely to share fairly than males), p =
0.06. There were no interactions with CP knowledge or trial
type (p = .64). Therefore, understanding the cardinal
principle predicted children’s abilities to share fairly even in
a first-party context.
We then confirmed that as in Experiment 1, age was
significantly associated with CP Knowledge, B = 2.51,
SE(B) = 0.50, Wald(1) = 25.62, p = 0.0000004.
As a last step, we tested whether CP knowledge mediated
the effect of age on fair sharing. As with Experiment 1, we
combined Models 1 and 2 and used both age and CP
knowledge as predictors (Model 3). There was a continued
significant effect of CP knowledge (such that CP knowers
were more likely to share fairly than subset knowers), B =
1.58, SE(B) = 0.52, 95%CI = 0.57 – 2.60, Wald(1) = 9.36, p
= .002, and no longer any significant effect of Age, p =
0.55. As with the previous models, there was also a
significant effect of Trial Type, B = -0.95, SE(B) = 0.29,
95%CI = -1.53 – -0.38, Wald(1) = 10.55, p = .001 and no
significant effect of Gender, p = 0.20. A formal mediation
test confirmed that CP knowledge fully mediated agerelated differences in fair sharing, Sobel test z = 2.60, p =
0.009 (see Figure 2). Therefore, knowledge of the cardinal
principle, and not age, predicted children’s abilities to share
fairly in our first-party context.

Figure 2: Mediation analysis in Experiment 2
We were also interested in the types of errors children
make when they failed to share fairly. We looked at trials
during which children had not shared fairly (n = 81 of a total
of 184 trials). One possibility is that young children tend to
default to selfishness. If this is the case, we might expect

1610

that younger children will consistently behave selfishly and
keep most resources for themselves. Another possibility,
however, is that children are motivated to share fairly, but
do not always have the cognitive skills (i.e., numerical
cognition) in order to do so. If this is the case, children
should be just as likely to make either fair sharing error
(either generous sharing or selfish sharing).
Confirming the latter possibility, children did not
strategically default to selfishness: Of the trials during
which they did not share fairly, approximately half were
generous (n = 42 of 81; 52%) and the other half were selfish
(n = 39, 48%).
We also tested whether CP knowledge predicted how
close children’s errors were to fair sharing behavior. We
computed a “Difference from Fairness” score (DFS)
reflecting the magnitude of the deviation of the child’s
sharing behavior from perfect fair sharing behavior. The
DFS reflected the absolute value of the difference between
the number of resources the child gave to the puppet (child’s
sharing behavior) and the number reflecting fair sharing
(i.e., 3 in the six resource trial and 2 in the four resource
trial). Thus, children who made “greater” errors and
deviated more from fair sharing received higher DFS scores.
We ran a Poisson model using DFS score as the response
and CP knowledge, Age, Trial Type (entered as a withinsubjects effect), and Gender as the predictors. The results
revealed a significant effect of CP knowledge, B = -.33,
SE(B) = .17, 95%CI = -0.66 - -0.002, Wald(1) = 3.69, p =
.05, and no other significant effects, all p’s > .25. Therefore,
CP knowers had lower DFS scores, suggesting that children
with limited numerical cognition also deviated to a greater
extent from fair sharing behavior.2
To make sure that this result could not be explained by
children simply becoming more generous as they aged (and
thus becoming more fair in the selfish subsample), we also
ran this model using number of stickers donated to the
puppet as a response. There were no significant effects in
either the subsample of kids who had not shared fairly, or in
the full dataset. This rules out the possibility that as children
age and gain numeracy skills, they simply become less
interested in the resources or more generous with them.
Instead, this supports the idea that as children acquire
cardinality, their behavior approaches fairness.

Discussion
As in Experiment 1, numerical cognition predicted and
explained age-related differences in children’s abilities to
share fairly, even in a context in which children may be
particularly motivated to share unfairly (be selfish).
Children who did not share fairly did not strategically
default to selfishness – instead, they were just as likely to be
generous as they were to be selfish. CP knowers made errors
that were smaller in magnitude (closer to fairness) than
subset knowers. These results suggest that even in a context
2

We did not find any relationship between DFS scores and CP
knowledge in Experiment 1.

in which children may have been motivated to be unfair,
numerical cognition continued to predict fair sharing
behavior.

General Discussion
A body of recent work has documented the early
development of our concern for others’ welfare. We add to
this work by showing that between the ages of 2.5 and 5.5,
children develop the capacity to distribute resources fairly..
Importantly, our results highlight a key cognitive
mechanism that enables such sharing behavior. Numerical
cognition predicted young children’s abilities to share fairly
and their sharing strategies. Strikingly, numerical cognition
also mediated age-related changes in fair sharing.
Recent work has found that young children recognize
fairness before age two (e.g., Schmidt & Sommerville,
2012), but do not necessarily act fairly themselves (e.g.,
Fehr et al., 2008; Posid, Fazio, & Cordes, 2015; Smith et al.,
2013). Our findings have two important implications for
fairness. First, we find that sufficient motivation is not
enough to enable fairness in young children. Even in a thirdparty context, in which children are motivated to share
equally (Olson & Spelke, 2008), children were not always
able to do so. This suggests that fairness involves not only
sufficient motivation, but also the coordination of laterdeveloping socio-cognitive abilities.
Second, we find that nonsymbolic numerical abilities are
also not enough to enable fair distribution behavior. One
possibility could have been that sharing 4 stickers would
require only the ability to discriminate between 1 vs. 3
items, or between a 2/2 distribution and a 1/3 distribution - a
problem that even infants are capable of solving (Feigenson
& Carey, 2003; Schmidt & Sommerville, 2012). Instead,
however, our results found that knowledge of cardinality
and explicit understanding of counting was critical to
children’s abilities to act fairly. This suggests that while
nonsymbolic numerical abilities may be implied in
children’s passive and implicit understanding of fairness,
active manipulation of resources requires the laterdeveloping ability of counting proficiency.
Future work might focus on the mechanism by which the
acquisition of cardinality scaffolds sharing decisions. One
possibility is that children already have a rudimentary
understanding of equality as a social norm (Schmidt &
Sommerville, 2011; Geraci & Surian, 2011; Sloan,
Baillargeon, & Premack, 2012), and that acquiring the
cardinal principle simply helps children realize that norm in
their own behavior.
Our work focused on how knowledge of the cardinal
principle is related to third-party and first-party resource
distribution. However, both fairness and numerical
cognition involve a host of other sub-component
competencies that follow distinct developmental pathways.
For example, fairness involves the ability to engage in thirdparty moral evaluation of others (thought to be an earlydeveloping capacity; Schmidt & Sommerville, 2012) as well
as the ability to engage in altruistic sharing (e.g., Svetlova,

1611

Nichols, & Brownell, 2010). Similarly, numerical cognition
includes the approximate number system (ANS; e.g., Xu &
Spelke, 2000), knowledge of the cardinal principle (e.g.,
Wynn, 1990), the ability to map symbols onto their
respective magnitudes (e.g., Mundy & Gilmore, 2009), and
other related competencies (e.g., school-based arithmetic).
Future work is warranted to explore the specific numerical
competencies (and cognitive systems) that underlie each
type of social behavior.
More generally, our work points to important links
between social and cognitive development in early
childhood. This link is important to consider from the
perspective of developing young children’s number
knowledge and their sharing behavior: For example, it is
important to keep in mind the child’s individual cognitive
competencies (e.g., number knowledge) when studying
social behavior. Similarly, giving children experiences with
sharing may help their numerical understanding. More
generally, bridging social and cognitive development may
help us gain better insights into the developmental processes
of each.
