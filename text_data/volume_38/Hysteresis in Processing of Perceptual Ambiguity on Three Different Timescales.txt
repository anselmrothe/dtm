Abstract

quality of the sensory information and probably
also of the availability of fitting memory contents
(e.g., Kornmeier & Mayer, 2014). However, the
term “memory” encompasses information from the
immediate perceptual history up to long-term
memory and it is unclear exactly how memory
contents from different time scales contribute to the
perceptual outcome.
In the present study, we investigated perception
of the ambiguous “Necker lattice” (Kornmeier,
Heinrich, Atmanspacher, & Bach, 2001; Kornmeier
& Bach, 2004), a variant of the classical Necker
cube (Necker, 1832), and lattices variants with
different degrees of disambiguation in order to
quantify the contributions of sensory information
and memory from three different time scales.

Sensory information is a priori incomplete and
ambiguous. Our perceptual system has to make
predictions about the sources of the sensory
information, based on concepts from perceptual
memory in order to create stable and reliable
percepts.
We
presented
ambiguous
and
disambiguated lattice stimuli (variants of the Necker
cube) in order to measure a hysteresis effects in
visual perception. Fifteen healthy participants
observed two periods of ordered sequences of
lattices with increasing and decreasing ambiguity
and indicated their percepts, in two experimental
conditions with different starting stimuli of the
ordered sequence. We compared the stimulus
parameters at the perceptual reversal between
conditions and periods and found significant
differences between conditions and periods,
indicating memory contributions to perceptual
outcomes on three different time scales from
milliseconds over seconds up to lifetime memory.
Our results demonstrate the fruitful application of
physical
concepts
like
hysteresis
and
complementarity to visual perception.

Hysteresis and Ambiguous Figures
During prolonged observation of an ambiguous
figure, such as the Necker lattice, our perception
becomes unstable and suddenly alternates between
different interpretations (e.g. the two different 3D
perspectives of the lattice), although the stimulus
information stays unchanged. Luminance changes
of the apparent lattice back layer can disambiguate
the stimulus and stabilize the observers’ percepts.
Ambiguous figures are popular stimuli to study the
respective bottom-up and top-down contributions to
the resolution of sensory ambiguity (e.g., Long &
Toppino, 2004) and their physiological correlates
(e.g., Kornmeier & Bach 2012).
In the present study we focus on hysteresis
effects in the context of ambiguous figure
perception. Hysteresis is an elementary form of
history-dependent behaviour that is frequently
observed in physical systems (first demonstrated by
Ewing, 1881). It describes multistable systembehaviour where, depending on the direction of
parameter change, the system can be in one of
several states. Specifically, transitions back to a

Introduction
The environmental information available to our
senses is incomplete and to varying degrees
ambiguous. As a result, our perceptual system
needs to disambiguate and interpret this information
in order to construct fast and reliable solutions to all
types of sensory input of whatever quality (the
‘visual inference problem’, von Helmholtz, 1911).
Accordingly, perception has been widely discussed
as a weighting of sensory (bottom-up) information
with memorized (top-down) concepts in terms of
Bayesian probability estimation (e.g., Kersten,
Mamassian, & Yuille, 2004). The contribution of
sensory and memory information to the perceptual
outcome may thus change as a function of the

568

previous state lag behind the change in parameters.
Hysteresis behaviour can be found in visual
perception, e.g., in the perception of ambiguous
figures and disambiguated variants thereof (e.g.,
Fender & Julesz, 1967; Fisher & Ciuffreda, 1989;
Hock, Kelso, & Schöner, 1993).
Observation
of
hysteresis
depends
on
preservation of history in parameter change and the
presence of perceptual reversals in two directions.
Figure 1 displays a series of stimuli that is designed
to elicit two perceptual reversals. It starts with an
unambiguous “front-side right bottom” view lattice
“SFRB” with maximally reduced luminance m of the
apparent lattice back layer (Figure 1, left). Linearly
increasing m with each stimulus results in the most
ambiguous lattice with iso-luminant front and back
layers (Figure 1, third to left). Again linearly
decreasing m to a maximally reduced back-layer
luminance, results in the alternative unambiguous
“front-side left top” view lattice “SFLT” (Figure 1,
middle). This procedure is then reversed via the
ambiguous lattice (Figure 1, third to right) back to
the unambiguous front-right-bottom view SFRB
(Figure 1, right).

implications for understanding the behaviour of
such systems, e.g., see Kaplan & Glass, 2012). In
the context of visual perception, measures of
hysteresis can quantify the influence of perceptual
memory on the current percept. However,
contrasting two reversals in a series of stimuli
containing two periods of increasing and decreasing
ambiguity (e.g., SFLT => SAmb => SFRB => SAmb =>
SFLT), may reflect a mixture of memory effects on
two different time scales: (1) An immediate
memory effect, reflecting the influence of
immediately preceding stimuli within one period
and (2) an intermediate memory effect, reflecting
the influence of period 1 (e.g., SFLT => SAmb =>
SFRB ) on the perceptual dynamics in period 2 (e..g,
SFRB =>
SAmb => SFLT). In order to fully
disentangle immediate from intermediate memory
effects, we tested several other contrasts.
Long-Term
Memory
Effects
Long-term
perceptual memory can also have an influence on
the perception of an ambiguous stimulus. In the
case of the Necker cube perception is biased
towards the front-side right bottom perceptual
interpretation (e.g. Sundareswara & Schrater, 2008;
see also data from page 485 in Washburn, Mallay,
& Naylor, 1931), reflecting a general view-fromabove preference, which is also demonstrated in
other contexts (e.g., Troje & McAdam, 2010) and
which may be based on long-term perceptual
memory. We will quantify the influence of this long
term memory in the following way: The hysteresis
effect should be manifested as a linear shift of the
two sigmoidal perceptual probability functions
coming from the two stimulus presentation orders
in opposite directions along the abscissa
(representing the morphing parameter). Moreover,
if the a priori probabilities of the two Necker lattice
interpretations are equal, i.e. in the absence of any
perceptual bias, we should expect equal distances of
two sigmoids’ inflection points from mAmb
(representing the Necker lattice with iso-iluminant
layers). Any deviation from this symmetry should
indicate inequality of the two Necker lattice
interpretations, which would allow quantification of
long-term memory effects.

Different Time-Scales of Memory
Classic Hysteresis Effect Presenting a series of
lattices as described above, perceptual reversals are
expected to take place around the ambiguous
lattice. Assuming the absence of any type of
influence of perceptual history on perception, the
order of stimulus presentation should have no effect
on the critical stimulus parameter for perceptual
reversals. However, the presence of hysteresis
implies that perception will reverse from PFRB
(front-right-bottom view, cf. stimulus SFRB) to PFLT
(front-left-top view, cf. stimulus SFLT) at a certain
back-layer luminance value mcritical,1, which will be
different from value mcritical,2, when moving back
from PFLT to PFRB. In other words, the second
perceptual reversal depends on the first perceptual
reversal. We plan to quantify this classical
hysteresis effect with a measure called “hysteresis
distance” = mcritical,1 – mcritical,2, and hypothesise this
distance to be significantly different from zero.
Additionally, If multiple series are presented to a
single person, his/her aggregated stimulus
perception can be expressed as a sigmoidal
probability function of the stimulus morphing
parameter m, and the function’s inflection point at
the probability p = 0.5 can be used as an estimate of
the aggregated critical morphing parameter value
𝑚!"#$#!%& (Figure 3; see method section for more
details about the fitting procedure). These critical
values can subsequently be used to understand
memory effects on three different timescales.

Method
Participants Fifteen participants (9 women, 5 men,
1 unknown, M = 27.4 ± 7.9 years old) participated
in an ambiguous figures experiment designed to
measure memory effects such as hysteresis on
perceptual reversals. Previous to participating, all
participants were asked for their consent and given
instructions about the procedure. The study was
performed in accordance with the ethical standards
laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki (World
Medical Association, 2000) and approved by the
ethics committee of the University of Freiburg.

Immediate and Intermediate Memory Effects
Hysteresis is a hallmark characteristic behaviour of
nonlinear dynamical systems (with its own set of

Figure 1: Necker lattices stimuli used in the experimental paradigm. From left to right, in the SFRB => SFLT =>
SFRB series, we start with a fully disambiguated front-side right bottom view (SFRB), then ambiguity increases to
full ambiguity (SAmb), then ambiguity decreases again to a front-side top left view (SFLT), and then the process is
reverted back. Around the 9th and 26th trial (SAmb), we expect a perceptual reversal due to the changing
orientation of the lattice. In the SFLT => SFRB => SFLT series, the stimuli are presented in opposite order. S:
Stimulus; Amb: Ambiguous; FRB: Lattice front-side to the right bottom; FLT: Lattice front-side to the left top.
Stimuli We presented an ambiguous “Necker
lattice” consisting of 3x3 Necker cubes (Figure 1,
SAmb) and 16 disambiguated lattice variants SFRB;1 SFRB;8,and SFLT;1 - SFLT;8, with “FRB” = front-side
right bottom and “FLT” = front-side left top, and S
= stimulus (Figure 1). Stimulus disambiguation and
thus percept stabilization was achieved by reducing
the luminance of the virtual back layers of the
lattices. Luminance was 0.8 cd/m2 for the
ambiguous Necker lattice and the front layers of all
disambiguated lattices. Luminance values in cd/m2
for the apparent back-layers were in descending
order: 0.71, 0.59, 0.48, 0.37, 0.27, 0.18, 0.07, and
0.04. All lattices subtended an area of 5.5° x 6.5°
visual angle. A cross in the centre of the lattices
served as fixation target.

Results
Participants responded to more than 99% of the
presented stimuli, indicating a sufficiently long
response time window and ensuring an unequivocal
stimulus-response relation.

Classic Hysteresis Within Each Series
A total of 150 series (across participants and
repetitions) containing 33 perceptual responses
each were collected. Each series contained two
potential perceptual reversals, i.e., there were 300
potential reversals in total. Of these, 102 were
clearly identifiable with each response being
preceded by a continuous sequence of PFLT’s (or
PFRB’s, depending on the condition) and followed
by a continuous sequence of PFRB’s (or PFLT’s). For
these reversals, the particular stimulus for which the
reversal took place was determined by averaging
the respective stimulus values around the clear
division between the two continuous sequences (see
Figure 2, “clear reversal”). For the remaining 198
reversals, where participants recorded reversals
more than once per period, we estimated this value,
by first reordering the responses between the last of
the preceding continuous sequence and the first of
the following continuous sequence, in order to
mimic a “clear reversal”. Then, we again took the
average of stimulus order values before and after
the resulting “clear reversal” (see Figure 2,
“estimated reversal”). For 18 reversals this
procedure did not work, the corresponding series
were too messy and were excluded from the
analysis, resulting in 274 reversals in 137 series
(i.e. one reversal per period).

Procedure Each participant was presented with ten
repetitions of a series of 33 Necker lattices with
varying orientation1. The experiment consisted of
two conditions, each consisting of two periods. In
Condition 1 the lattice orientations were varied
step-wise from SFRB, over the fully ambiguous
lattice SAmb to SFLT (first period) and back again
over SAmb to SFRB (second period). In Condition 2
we presented the lattices in the reversed order:
SFLT => SAmb => SFRB => SAmb => SFLT.
Both conditions were presented five times to each
participant in randomized order. After stimulus
onset, participants indicated their perceived lattice
orientation (either PFRB for the front-side right
bottom view or PFLT for the front-side left top view)
by pressing one of two buttons on a hand-held
response box during the presentation of the
stimulus. After participants’ responses the stimulus
remained on the screen for another 1000 ms (but
maximal 4000 ms in total) and was replaced by a
blank screen with the fixation target for 400 ms.

(in white) => PFLT (in grey) reversal. The first
pattern represents a “clear reversal”. The second
pattern requires reordering the responses between
the continuous sequences of PFRB’s and PFLT’s.
The hysteresis distance was computed by
numbering the stimuli by presentation order and
subtracting the stimulus order values Ni for which
the two reversals in that series took place: Ndiff =
Nrev1 – Nrev2. On average, the resulting difference
values Ndiff were significantly smaller than zero
(Mean Ndiff = -1.35, SD = 2.33, t(136) = -6.76, p <
.001), indicating a negative hysteresis effect; rather
than the second reversals lagging behind and
occurring during more strongly disambiguated
stimuli, they occur at less strongly disambiguated
stimuli. In particular, the second reversals result
1.35 “disambiguation steps” sooner than the first.
Comparing conditions showed no significant
difference between the SFLT => SFRB => SFLT and
SFRB= > SFLT => SFRB conditions (t(135) = -1.84, p =
.07).

the perceptual reversals in the first period of a
series, from PFRB => PFLT (in blue), and PFLT =>
PFRB (in red). The aggregated response curves are
displayed in bold.

Immediate and Intermediate Effects
The sigmoids’ inflection points indicate where, on
average, the perceptual reversals took place.
Looking only at the perceptual reversals that
occurred in the first period (see Figure 3), gives
insight into the effect of immediate memory. On
average, these first reversals occurred for the
second stimulus to the right of the fully ambiguous
lattice, (Mean Nrev = 10.97, SD Nrev = 1.16) meaning
for the stimulus that has been disambiguated
towards SFLT with two steps. Furthermore, the two
bold lines (aggregated data) indicate a difference
between the PFLT => PFRB and PFRB => PFLT
reversals. When the immediate predecessors of the
more ambiguous stimuli are SFRB, the corresponding
percepts lose stability later (i.e., at Mean Nrev =
10.44, SD Nrev = 1.16) than when the immediate
predecessors are SFLT (i.e., at Mean Nrev = 11.39,
SD Nrev = 1.01).
Figure 4 displays the response curves for both the
first and second period of the SFRB => SFLT => SFRB
condition. Again we see that the perceptual
reversals do not occur for the same values of backlayer luminance. The results we found when
comparing the periods within conditions: Both
perceptual reversals occurred at stimuli with
luminance values favouring percepts PFLT, whereas
the reversals in the first period occurs closer to the

Aggregated Response curves
After collecting all responses, each PFLT (i.e., the
perception of a lattice in the front-side left top
view) was coded as “0”, and each PFRB as ‘1’.2
Then, for each of the two conditions, i.e., taking 5
repetitions together, individual responses for each
half of the series were fitted with a sigmoid curve
as described by equation 1, where m is the point of
inflection and s is the slope.

Of the resulting fits, we excluded 11 response

predefined criterion of 0.5. Figure 3 displays the
remaining aggregated response curves containing
the first perceptual reversal of a series for each
participant. About half of these response curves are

F(1,45) = .14, p = .74). Furthermore, we found an
interaction effect between condition and period
(F(1,45) = 27.24, p < .001).

Discussion
Presenting a series of lattice stimuli with two
different orders of increasing and decreasing
ambiguity results in significant hysteresis effects
around the resulting perceptual reversals. These
hysteresis effects can be interpreted in relation to
memory contributions to perceptual outcomes on
three different time scales: (1) The critical stimulus
parameter (back-layer luminance) for a reversal
between the two different 3D percepts of the lattice
stimuli differed between the two presentation
orders, reflecting an immediate memory effect, i.e.
the influence of the immediate perceptual history
on a milliseconds time scale on the current
percepts. (2) This immediate memory effect is
stronger in the first time period of increasing and
decreasing lattice ambiguity compared to the
second time period, indicating the influence of the
first period on the second and thus an intermediate
memory effect on a time scale of seconds on
perception. (3) The inflection points of all
sigmoidal perceptual probability functions of any
experimental condition are all located at luminance
values favouring the lattice front side top left
perspective SFLT, reflecting a long-term memory
effect.
At each moment in our everyday life our
perception results from the disambiguation and
interpretation of incomplete and to varying degrees
ambiguous sensory information. Ambiguous figures
are perfect stimuli to study the principles
underlying these disambiguation processes, because
we can compare perception at maximal stimulus
ambiguity and during a stepwise parametrical
ambiguity reduction. The literature offers plenty of
evidence for top-down influences on the perception
of an ambiguous figure (e.g., Long & Toppino,
2004) and studies about priming and adaptation
effects in particular already indicate different
memory effects on different time scales (e.g., Long,
Toppino & Mondin, 1992).
The present experimental paradigm further
allows a distinction of memory effects on three
different time scales. Recent predictive coding
approaches (e.g., Friston, 2012) postulate that the
perceptual system makes predictions about the
sources of the sensory information, based on the
immediate perceptual history and stored concepts
from perceptual long-term memory. The present
results confirm this perfectly; any specific
perceptual situation, like a specific experimental
paradigm, can have a strong influence on the
perceptual process and outcomes. This observation
is highly relevant for any type of experiment on
perception and interpretation of results.

Long-Term Memory Effects
Figure 5 displays the response curves together for
the same type of reversal from different periods,
and it is clear that regardless of the timing, the PFLT
percept loses stability “sooner” (Fig. 5 right, i.e. at
lattices with more luminance contrast) than the PFRB
percept (Fig. 5 left), although both perceptual
reversals occur past the ambiguous stimulus at
luminance values in support of percepts PFLT.
Altogether, using a Two-Way Analysis of
Variance, we found a main effect for the factor
Condition (i.e., SFRB => SFLT => SFRB versus SFLT =>
SFRB => SFLT) on the variable inflection point
position (F(1,45) = 5.11, p = .029) but no effect for

The present experiment together with similar,
earlier studies (e.g., Hock, Bukowski, Nichols,
Huisman, & Rivera, 2005) demonstrate the fruitful
application of the physical hysteresis concept to
visual perception. Our results show patterns of
another important concept from physics, namely
complementarity or non-commutativity, which has
already been successfully applied in the context of
multistable perception and cognition (e.g.,
