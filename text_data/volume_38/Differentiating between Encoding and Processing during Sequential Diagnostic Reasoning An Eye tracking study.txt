Hitting this field, the light rays get reflected and exit the

  Participants have to place the atoms based on the
information drawn from the rays that were shot in the box.
The participant has to place as many atom markers at the
grid as needed to explain the ray pattern of one trial without
placing more atoms as absolutely necessary. During one
trial, the participant watches a fixed number of rays in
sequential order one at a time displayed by numbers

Participants have to remember where the rays entered and

assumed enough time to encode even words (Rayner, 2009).
During every re-visit of that same area we expect
participants to process this location since it is already
encoded.
  For every dwell we calculated the mean number of
fixations and the mean fixation duration. We aggregated
first-visit dwells and re-visit dwells over every symptom
presentation, trial and participant.
                                Results
Participants tended to look mostly at task relevant areas.
Aggregated over symptom presentations, trials and
participants 12.08 % of the fixation time was on average
directed to the AOI containing the atom (SD = 9.05). The
participants looked mostly to the AOI where the rays hit the
field of influence of an atom (M = 21.16 %, SD = 14.76) and
14.63 % of the fixation time fell on average to the two AOIs
covering the rays (SD = 7.00). 5.24 % of the time
participants fixated on the AOI with the cue in the upper left
corner (SD = 4.15). Taken together, participants looked
more than 50% of the time to direct task-relevant AOIs
which covered only about 5 % of the grid. Fixation duration
weighted by the number of AOIs, participants looked
significantly longer to the atoms (t(27) = 19.82, p < .001, d
= 3.81), to the field of influence of the atom (t(27) = 20.38,
p < .001, d = 3.92), to the rays (t(27) = 20.45; p = <-001, d =
3.80) and to the cue in the upper left corner (t(27) = 12.86, p
< .001, d = 2.47) than to all the other AOIs.
  They found correct solutions for most of the trials (M =
71.3%, SD = 0.13). Therefore, we conclude that participants
have understood task instructions and engaged in diagnostic
reasoning as we intended.
  The calibration procedure reached a satisfying accuracy
with a mean deviation of M = 0.54° (SD = 0.53).
  We assumed that encoding and processing can be

fixation duration and number of fixations per dwell is
increased during re-visits compared to first-visits, assuming
that first-visits represent encoding whereas re-visits map                                 t

  Over all, we find longer fixations during re-visits than
