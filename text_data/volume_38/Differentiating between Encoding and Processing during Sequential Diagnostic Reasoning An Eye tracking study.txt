the right diagnosis (Mehlhorn, Taatgen, Lebiere, & Krems,
2011). But there are more applications such as finding the
error in a technical system like a car or a computer (Johnson
& Krems, 2001; Krems & Zierer, 1994; Mehlhorn et al.,
2011). For instance, imagine you experience a loss in power
of your car. Later, you witness some blue smoke coming
from your exhaust pipe. Furthermore, you feel that recently,
your car needs more oil as usual and your “check engine”
light turns on. By combining these observations, you come
up with the explanation that your car has an engine damage.
Diagnostic reasoning involves the processing of a number
of observations and explanations. Often, the reasoner does
not have all the necessary information available at once, but
receives them in a sequential order. The reasoner then needs
to integrate the symptom information into a situation model
containing symptoms and explanations (Johnson & Krems,
2001; Johnson-Laird, Byrne, & Schaeken, 1992).
Besides this complexity, people are generally able to solve
problems (Johnson & Krems, 2001), but how do they
successfully engage in this demanding task? A number of
process models (e.g., TAR: Johnson & Krems, 2001; TEC:
Thagard, 1989; HyGene: Thomas, Dougherty, Sprenger, &
Harbison, 2008) provide assumptions about ongoing
memory processes. For instance, TAR assumes that encoded
symptoms have to be evaluated concerning their fit with the
current model of explanations (Johnson & Krems, 2001) and
HyGene states that newly encoded information has to be
judged concerning its implication for existing explanations
(e.g., Thomas et al., 2008). Thus, in order to test these
process assumptions, it is necessary to disentangle encoding
and processing. Therefore, the process of diagnostic
reasoning needs to be made visible. So far, different
methodological approaches exist to trace memory processes
in higher order cognitive tasks like judgement and decision

Abstract
When finding a best explanation for observed symptoms a
multitude of information has to be integrated and matched
against explanations stored in memory. Although assumptions
about ongoing memory processes can be derived from the
process models, little process data exists that would allow to
sufficiently test these assumptions.
In order to explore memory processes in diagnostic
reasoning, 29 participants were asked to solve a visual
reasoning task (the Black Box paradigm) where critical
information had to be retrieved from memory.
This study focused on differentiating between processes
that take place during the encoding and the evaluation of
symptom information by comparing eye movement measures
(the number of fixation and fixation duration per dwell).
Results will be discussed in light of existing theories on
sequential diagnostic reasoning. Further, it will be discussed
to which extent eye movements can be informative about
memory processes underlying sequential diagnostic
reasoning.
Keywords: diagnostic reasoning; eye tracking; process
tracing; encoding-processing differences

Introduction
In sequential diagnostic reasoning multiple pieces of
information have to be combined to find a best explanation
for observed symptoms (e.g., Johnson & Krems, 2001). It is
a complex cognitive process since the reasoner generates an
undefined number of explanations for any number of
observations (Johnson & Krems, 2001). Nevertheless,
understanding this process is a major goal of research
concerning reasoning and problem solving because of its
high practical relevance. For instance, in the medical
context, a complete understanding of diagnostic reasoning
can help to save lives by improving the process of forming

129

making (e.g., Glaholt & Reingold, 2011; SchulteMecklenbeck, Kühberger, & Ranyard, 2011).
Recently, eye tracking is employed as a process tracing
method to assess memory processes (see Glaholt &
Reingold, 2011; Jahn & Braatz, 2014; Schulte-Mecklenbeck
et al., 2011). Advanced hardware and improved
understanding of its measures make it possible to get better
insights (Jahn & Braatz, 2014; Renkewitz & Jahn, 2012;
Scholz, von Helversen, & Rieskamp, 2015).
Monitoring eye movements allows the study of cognitive
processes while participants interact with present objects
without causing any restrictions and with minimal intrusions
on the participant’s behavior (Glaholt & Reingold, 2011).
But interpreting eye tracking measures is challenging. The
growing number of measures and their variety of
applications complicate the assignment of specific measures
to specific cognitive processes (Holmqvist et al., 2011).
Glaholt and Reingold, (2011) present a way to
differentiate between encoding and processing in decision
making by analyzing eye movement data. They asked
participants to choose one picture out of a set of nine. They
categorized dwells (defined as the sum of fixation durations
of all fixations from the moment the gaze enters an area
until it exits this area) into first-visit dwells and re-visit
dwells, whereas re-visit dwells are the repeated viewing of
an alternative. They found that mean fixation durations per
dwell increases over time. The number of fixation per dwell
is increasing between first-visits and re-visits as well. This
indicates processing, such as evaluation of the current
stimuli. The researchers interpreted these results as evidence
that early in the process, participants merely screened the
stimuli, moving to processing of the stimuli as they try to
reach a decision. Even very early research finds evidence
that the deliberate processing of information results in more
and longer fixations (Loftus & Mackworth, 1978). As
screening/encoding is assumed to happen implicitly without
conscious control (Betsch, Hoffmann, Hoffrage, & Plessner,
2003) few fixations are plausible and in line with
assumptions by Horstmann, Ahlgrimm, and Glöckner,
(2009). Increased number of fixations, on the other hand,
reflect processes such as the evaluation of an alternative
which emerge later in the process of decision making
(Horstmann et al., 2009). In contrast to Glaholt and
Reingold (2011), Horstmann et al., (2009) did not find
evidence that processing is associated with longer fixation
durations.
Previous research on differences in eye movement patterns
between encoding and processing of information in memory
focuses on decision making. We assume that it is possible to
use the knowledge about processes of decision making in
the context of diagnostic reasoning as well. Encoding and
processing differences are part of many models and
assumptions. Whenever there is something to decide, we
encode much information in a short period of time and
subsequently evaluate and process this information
(Glöckner & Betsch, 2008). As stated by TAR or HyGene
(Johnson & Krems, 2001; Thomas et al., 2008), we assume

that the same holds true when finding a best explanation for
a set of symptoms.
Congruently, we assume that encoding and processing can
be differentiated by the means of eye tracking measures, i.e.
analyzing fixation duration and number of fixation per
dwell. Following Glaholt and Reingold, (2011) and
Horstmann et al., (2009) we assume that the number of
fixation per dwell is increased during processes which
appear later in the reasoning process such as symptom
evaluation compared to the encoding of information.
In order to test our hypothesis, we used a task where
information was presented in a sequential order. Remember
the example with the engine trouble, people most likely
witness one symptom such as the power loss at first and
subsequently watch for more symptoms which are usually
discovered one after another. In addition we need a task
with the complexity comparable to that of everyday life
problems. There were many symptoms pointing in the
direction of engine damage, some of which might be related.
The blue smoke is easily explained as soon as you know
about the increased oil consumption. The car might burn
some oil. On the other hand, we needed to control for prior
knowledge of participants to get comparable results.
Additionally, the task has to be learnable in an experimental
setting. These requirements are met in Black Box task
(BBX, Johnson & Krems, 2001). The Black Box task is a
reasoning paradigm in which all information is, just as in
our car example, visuospatial in nature. The symptoms are
related to different areas of the car such as the exhaust pipe,
the cockpit, or the dipstick in the motor compartment.
Therefore, the Black Box task is especially suited to study
memory processes during diagnostic reasoning with eye
movements.

Method
Participants solved the Black Box task while their eye
movements were recorded. In the Black Box paradigm, the
participants’ task is to determine a hidden state of a device
using indirect evidence that needs to be combined following
specific rules. Participants first learn and then apply the
rules to get insight into the device by explaining
observations with a combination of causes.

Participants
Twenty-nine students enrolled at Technische Universität
Chemnitz took part in the experiment. One participant had
to be excluded due to technical problems. Of the remaining
participants 20 were female and 8 were male with a mean
age of M = 22.3 (SD = 3). All participants had normal or
corrected to normal vision.

Task and Apparatus
The participants’ task is to locate hidden atoms in the
Black Box which consists of a 10 x 10 grid by watching
where light rays enter and exit the box. Participants do not
see the path of the light rays. They only see the entrance and
exit position of the light rays. As shown in Figure 1 each

130

atom has a field of influence (a circle around the atom).
Hitting this field, the light rays get reflected and exit the
box, depending on where in the box an atom is located.
Participants have to place the atoms based on the
information drawn from the rays that were shot in the box.
The participant has to place as many atom markers at the
grid as needed to explain the ray pattern of one trial without
placing more atoms as absolutely necessary. During one
trial, the participant watches a fixed number of rays in
sequential order one at a time displayed by numbers
marking the entrance and exit of the current ray (Figure 2).
Participants have to remember where the rays entered and
exited the Black Box as well as the atom locations of
already set atoms, because, just as in the car example,
symptoms might be related. For instance, it is possible that a
previous pattern needs to be remembered to explain the
current one (as illustrated in Figure 2: Ray five can be
explained by ray three.) Therefore, the paradigm allows to
measure memory processes that take place in sequential
diagnostic reasoning. The participant decides when to move
on to the next ray by pressing the space bar. How many rays
are left during one trial is shown at the upper left corner of
each Black Box (cue). An exemplary trial is pictured in
Figure 2.
The study recorded gaze data using a binocular IViewX
RED eye-tracking system from SensoMotric Instruments
with a sampling rate of 120 Hz. Data was analyzed with
BeGaze 3.0, Microsoft Excel 2007 and IBM Statistics 23
(SPSS).
Stimuli were presented on a 22-inch computer screen
using EPrime 2.0 software with a resolution of 1680 × 1050
pixels. All subjects were seated at a distance of 600 to 800
mm in front of the screen.

Figure 1: Rules in the Black Box.
If the ray does not hit any atom, it goes straight through the
Black Box (1). If a ray hits the field of influence at an angle,
it is reflected 90 degree. This results in a L-pattern (2). If a
ray hits a field of influence of an atom straight forward, it is
absorbed (3). The ray does not exit. Hitting a second field of
influence after being already reflected the light ray path
results in an U-pattern (4) or a Zick-Zack-pattern (5). Note,
light ray paths and atom locations are not visible for the
participant and have to be inferred. In this example all five
observations can be explained by three atoms.

Analysis
To test our hypotheses, quadratic Areas of Interests (AOIs)
were drawn around each square of the grid resulting in 100
separate AOIs, also called gridded AOIs (see Holmqvist et
al., 2011). Furthermore, we coded the AOIs where the rays
entered and exited the Black Box, where they hit the field of
influence of an atom and where atoms had to be set.
Following Glaholt and Reingold, (2011) we identified the
order of dwells in the AOIs and compared first-visit and revisit dwells. First-visits are termed the first dwell in each
AOI. Re-visits are all repeated dwells in that AOI. Re-visit
dwells integrate all dwells from the second till the last dwell
per AOI. In this point we slightly differ from the methods
applied by Glaholt and Reingold, (2011) who defined every
dwell as a re-visit that follows after any AOI is viewed a
second time, even if the gaze hits an AOI not viewed yet. In
decision making the transition between encoding the
alternatives and their evaluation is believed to be the point
in time where the first alternative is viewed a second time
(Russo & Leclerc, 1994). Since our material is relatively
complex we expect participants only to be able to encode
information if they actually look at it. If the gaze shifts to a
different AOI, information need to be encoded and
subsequently evaluated as well. Therefore, for diagnostic
reasoning, we expect that the first dwell into an AOI reflects
encoding and that all subsequent dwells in that same area
represent evaluation processes since participants test the
implication of the information for the current explanation
(e.g., Johnson & Krems, 2001).
We expect every first-visit of an area to map onto the
encoding of that area. Even if a dwell consist of only one

Procedure
Each participant was tested individually. After an initial
instruction phase, in which participants were familiarized
with the rules of the Black Box, two training phases
followed. During the first training phase, rays and atoms
were visible throughout the trial and therefore did not have
to be remembered. In the second training phase participants
solved the trial under test conditions (memory-based). That
is, they only saw where the current ray of light entered and
exited the Black Box and the cue in the upper left corner
(showing how many rays are left in the current trial). They
saw the atom and its field of influence as soon as they
placed it by using the mouse until they demanded a new ray
shot into the Black Box. No prior rays or atoms were
present. Each training phase consisted of seven trials. A
calibration and 48 test trials followed. The experiment
ended after a short survey containing demographic
questions. Participants needed 53 to 127 minutes to
complete the entire experiment (M = 85.2 min; SD = 21.1).

fixation; we are confident that participants encoded this
location sufficiently during their first visit since we defined
a fixation with a minimum duration of 80 ms which is
enough time to gather information since 50 to 60 ms are
assumed enough time to encode even words (Rayner, 2009).
During every re-visit of that same area we expect
participants to process this location since it is already
encoded.
For every dwell we calculated the mean number of
fixations and the mean fixation duration. We aggregated
first-visit dwells and re-visit dwells over every symptom
presentation, trial and participant.

compared to first-visits support our hypothesis that encoding
and processing can be differentiated by the means of the eye
tracking measures as Glaholt and Reingold, (2011) assumed.

Results
Participants tended to look mostly at task relevant areas.
Aggregated over symptom presentations, trials and
participants 12.08 % of the fixation time was on average
directed to the AOI containing the atom (SD = 9.05). The
participants looked mostly to the AOI where the rays hit the
field of influence of an atom (M = 21.16 %, SD = 14.76) and
14.63 % of the fixation time fell on average to the two AOIs
covering the rays (SD = 7.00). 5.24 % of the time
participants fixated on the AOI with the cue in the upper left
corner (SD = 4.15). Taken together, participants looked
more than 50% of the time to direct task-relevant AOIs
which covered only about 5 % of the grid. Fixation duration
weighted by the number of AOIs, participants looked
significantly longer to the atoms (t(27) = 19.82, p < .001, d
= 3.81), to the field of influence of the atom (t(27) = 20.38,
p < .001, d = 3.92), to the rays (t(27) = 20.45; p = <-001, d =
3.80) and to the cue in the upper left corner (t(27) = 12.86, p
< .001, d = 2.47) than to all the other AOIs.
They found correct solutions for most of the trials (M =
71.3%, SD = 0.13). Therefore, we conclude that participants
have understood task instructions and engaged in diagnostic
reasoning as we intended.
The calibration procedure reached a satisfying accuracy
with a mean deviation of M = 0.54° (SD = 0.53).
We assumed that encoding and processing can be
differentiated by the means of the eye tracking measures
analyzing dwells concerning fixation duration and fixation
frequency. More precisely, our hypothesis predicted that
fixation duration and number of fixations per dwell is
increased during re-visits compared to first-visits, assuming
that first-visits represent encoding whereas re-visits map
onto processing.
Over all, we find longer fixations during re-visits than
first-visits (Mfirst-visits = 267 ms, SD = 45, Mre-visits = 279 ms,
SD = 51, t(27) =- 1.94, p = .06, d = 0.37) and we find
significant more fixations during re-visit dwells compared to
first-visit dwells (Mfirst-visits = 1.25, SD = 0.09, Mre-visits =
1.31, SD = 0.10, t(27) =- 4.11, p < .001, d = 0.79).
An analysis of the different pattern separately shows that
there are differences. To illustrate this, we exemplary report
the L-pattern and the absorption in Table 1.

increase in number of fixations per dwell during re-visits

Figure 2: Exemplary trial
The trial consists of five rays shot into the Black Box
sequentially. For each ray the participant can place atoms to
explain them. When finished with one ray the participant
decides when to move on to the next one. The number (cue)
in the upper left corner shows how many more rays are to
come in the current trial. In this example the participant
should notice that no new atom need to be placed for ray
five since this ray can be explained by the atom already set
for ray three.

Zack- patterns may be useful, as they are more complex as
well. They are not included in the results of this paper since
those patterns are not used frequently enough throughout the
experiment to produce a reliable data basis.
We rule out the possibility that participants did not process
during re-visit dwells but encoded new features of already
encoded information. Since a single AOI contained simple
material with not much features like colors or different
shapes we consider this alternative very unlikely in this
specific task.
Further, we are confident that participants actually
encoded and processed what they were looking at. The fact
that participants reached fairly good response accuracies in
spite of a difficult and strongly memory based task speaks in
favor of this assumption. There was no evident reason to
separate eye movements and attention while solving the
Black Box task.
Since looking back to associated, but emptied spatial
locations can facilitate memory retrieval (e.g., Scholz,
Mehlhorn, & Krems, 2016), it is an interesting questions
whether there is a connection between gaze behavior and
accuracy during diagnostic reasoning, too. Do people who
solve the task successfully show a different gaze pattern?
Since our participants reached a fairly high response
accuracy in solving the trials, it is difficult to draw causal
conclusions to this question from our data. Future research
should address this question by careful manipulations.
We were able to replicate Glaholt and Reingolds (2011)
results that an increased number of fixations to an already
viewed area is an indicator for evaluation and processing of
information. However, it is difficult to make a clear
statement regarding the mean fixation duration per dwell.
In conclusion, eye movements show a high potential to
assess memory processes during higher-order reasoning and
thinking (see also Jahn & Braatz, 2014; Renkewitz & Jahn,
2012; Scholz et al., 2015). In particular, the number of
fixations per dwell may be used as process tracing measures
to asses processing during diagnostic reasoning. We found
increased number of fixations during a dwell to indicate
processing of information. The fact that we found a measure
that indicates evaluation processes allows for a more
detailed testing of process assumptions derived by process
models on diagnostic reasoning such as TAR (Johnson &
Krems, 2001), HyGene (Thomas et al., 2008) or TEC
(Thagard, 1989). All these models make assumption about
the manner in which the reasoner links observation or
symptoms to a set of explanations. Thereby the models
differ in their predictions to how this link is processed. TEC
for instance, describes this process as a judgment to which
extend symptoms and explanations are coherent (Thagard,
1989). Thereby, the encoding and evaluation of all
information to reach a judgement is supposed to happen
parallel. HyGene on the other hand, gives insight about the
way explanations are generated and used to asses new
information (Thomas et al., 2008). HyGene states that new
information are encoded sequentially and have to be judged
concerning their implication for existing explanations. TAR

Discussion
This study aimed to find a measure which is able to describe
reasoning processes differentiating between encoding and
processing. Therefore, we employed eye tracking as a
process tracing method because it is an objective and fine
grained measure to human behavior. Following research by
Glaholt and Reingold, (2011) and Horstmann et al., (2009)
we assumed that encoding and processing can be
differentiated by analyzing dwells concerning fixation
duration and fixation frequency.
Horstmann et al., (2009) and Glaholt and Reingold, (2011)
showed that a higher number of fixations might be an
indicator for more deliberate thinking and processing. Since
we assume encoding to be more intuitive and number of
fixations increases during re-visits when processing takes
place, our results support the research of Horstmann and
colleagues (2009) as well as Glaholt und Reingold, (2011).
Over all patterns as well as for L-pattern and absorption
individually increases the number of fixation with medium
to high effects. In line with the research by Horstmann et al.,
(2009) the analysis of fixation duration draws a less clear
picture. It might be that there is not such a clear difference
in fixation duration between (more intuitive) encoding and
(deliberate) processing as Horstmann et al., pointed out. The
researchers assume that intuitive and deliberate processes
may have similar underlying mechanisms as indicated by no
clearly distinct differences in fixation durations. The
differences between encoding and processing might not be
qualitative in nature but mainly quantitative regarding
information sampling. However clear differences between
L-pattern and absorption might indicate that both patterns
are not strictly similar processed. Horstmann et al., (200)
state that there may still be crucial differences regarding
intuitive and deliberate processes, which cannot be shown
by this measure. Since absorptions only identify the row or
column of the atom location, a second ray of light is needed
to determine the exact location in the Black Box, making the
absorption a more complex pattern. It remains to future
research to investigate the differences in processing of
different rules. Therefore the analysis of U-pattern and Zick-

133

describes diagnostic reasoning as a deliberate
comprehension process in which observations are
sequentially interpreted and integrated into a mental model
(Johnson & Krems, 2001). TAR assumes that one
information is encoded and evaluated before new
information is gathered, making encoding and processes
closely intertwined. All models have in common that they
assume perception-action cycles with different encoding and
processing phases. To describe reasoning, we need to know
how people use information to reach causal conclusions.
Therefore the first step is to know when people simply
gather information and when they actually use it for
evaluation, comparison or processing.
The process tracing measure presented in this paper may
help to disentangle encoding and processing assumptions
stated by different models giving more insight into
diagnostic reasoning by providing a possibility to identify
processing phases and test for precise research questions.
