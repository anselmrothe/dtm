Leaders’ movements was expected to be equal to all three
target locations according to Fitts’ law (Fitts, 1954).
Building on this law, that defines a tradeoff between
distance and target size, the targets were proportionally
larger for longer distances between start and target location.
Previous research has shown that Fitts’ law holds in
performance and motor imagery (Decety & Jeannerod,
1995) and also in action observation (Grosjean, Shiffrar, &
Knoblich, 2007).

Modulation of action duration
To investigate whether Leaders adapted their action per-
formance to inform Followers about the target location, we
first compared the signal-to-noise ratio for the overall time-
to-target (SNRTT; corresponding to the complete interval
between the two tones) in the three joint conditions. As
predicted, the SNRTT was significantly higher in None
(2.33) compared to Vision (.86), t(11) = 4.89, p < .001,
Cohen’s d = 2.95, and Pitch (1.04), t(11) = 4.71, p < .001,
Cohen’s d = 2.84. This indicates that Leaders provided a
clearer (i.e. more distinct and more consistent) signal when
Followers did not have other means to determine to which
target they should move.
