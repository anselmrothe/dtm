of minority individuals is superior to that of pairs; on the other
hand, the performance of majority groups is much worse than
that of pairs.
   Additionally, Table 5 shows the distribution of participants
who drew the reversed figure in the post questionnaire. A
chi-square test shows a significant difference in the distri-

more majority members drew the reversed figure than pairs
did. However, the results do not indicate that fewer minority
individuals drew the reversed figure more than pairs did.
