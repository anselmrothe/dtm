Participants
Fifty-four adults participated in the study and received
course credit (M= 19.11 years, male = 14). Inclusionary
criteria included: normal or corrected-to-normal vision,
normal hearing, no history of diagnosis or treatment of
cognitive, speech, language, or attentional issues, and
monolingual English speaker.

Before presenting the stimuli, the 20-pixel bull’s-eye image

After fixating on it, the sentence comprehension trial began.
Eye Movement Recording
Eye-movements were recorded using an EyeLink 1000
remote eye-tracker with a remote arm configuration and
sampled at 500 Hz. The eye-tracking camera was attached
to an LCD display and adjusted so that it was 580-620 mm
away from the participant’s right eye. Participants wore a
target sticker over the right eye to accommodate for head
and eye movements relative to the camera. Eye movements,
classified as saccades, fixations, and blinks by the software,
were measured during the sentence comprehension task
starting from the moment objects were presented on the
screen until participants selected a picture. Eye movements
were binned into 20 ms intervals offline for analysis.
