                              Abstract
   Age-related declines in scores on neuropsychological tests are
   widely believed to reveal that human cognitive capacities
   decline across the lifespan. In a computational simulation, we
   show how the behavioral patterns observed in Paired
   Associate Learning (PAL), a particularly sensitive measure of
   age-related performance change (Rabbitt & Lowe, 2000), are
   predicted by the models used to formalize associative learning
   processes in other areas of behavioral and neuroscientific
   research. The simulation further predicts that manipulating
   language exposure will reproduce the experience-related
   performance differences erroneously attributed to age-related
   decline in age-matched adults. Consistent with this, older
   bilinguals outperformed native speakers in a German PAL
   test, an advantage that increased with age. These analyses and
   results show that age-related PAL performance changes
   reflect the predictable effects of learning on the associability
   of test items, and indicate that failing to control for these             Figure 1: Average by-item performance for 400 adults

are the frequencies at which cue words have been
encountered absent response words, and blocking (Kamin,
1969; Arnon & Ramscar, 2012), the predictability of the
response given the cue (in context) prior to training. While
association rates tend to promote learning, blocking and
background rates inhibit it, and critically, the way these
factors interact to influence the learning of a specific
association is entirely a function of a given learner’s
experience (Ramscar et al., 2013a).
   This last point is critical to understanding the patterns of
PAL performance across the lifespan. As can be seen in
Figure 1, aging makes “hard” PAL items proportionally
harder to learn than “easy” items. This non-linear pattern of
change is not predicted by simple declines in plasticity or
fluid-intelligence – the changes that theories of cognitive
aging posit to explain declining test scores – yet as the
following simulation shows, it falls naturally out of the
interaction between experience and the three factors shown
to influence associative learning that we just described.                Figure 2: The development of word pair associations in

Materials
The vocabulary tests for both German and Chinese
consisted of 100 multiple choice questions with 4 possible
answers. The 3 incorrect answers were chosen from the
same parts-of-speech category as the correct answer.
   The word frequency distributions for the German and
Chinese vocabulary tests were matched, and items were
designed to ensure that Cue Frequency, Response
Frequency and Co-Occurrence Frequency (in Google
documents) for the pairs in each language were
approximately normal.
   The PAL test in both languages consisted of three groups
of 10 pairs. Pairs ranged in diffculty from easy (e.g.;
                       (school-study)     or    “Nord”-“Süd”
(north-south)) to hard (e.g.; “Schiff” - “Puppe” (ship-doll)
or                     (onion-finger)). Words occurred no
more than once in each of the paired associate learning tests.
