especially for people at the limits of expertise, it would be a
mistake to dismiss individual variations as “statistical noise.”
   We believe that something meaningful is going on within
individuals during these variations, and that is it important to
study them as individuals. Different subjects of different skill
levels may discover or invent different strategies. Different
methods for implementing the same strategy may be easier
for some individuals than others, and the nature of such dif-
ferences would not be apparent in aggregate data.
   Extreme expertise in tasks such as Space Fortress requires
highly complex strategies that demand tremendous cognitive
resources. More specifically, they are not simply “reactive”
– they require strategic choices as well as the invention of
methods that can be executed in the time alloted by a fast
paced game, situations in which, “even hesitating requires a
decision”1 and in which a temporary decrease in performance
may be the cost of exploring a different way of doing things.
