   We consider two types of features: landmark-based
features, such as “Agent X is north of its goal”, and agent-
relative features, such as “Agent X is north of Agent Y”.
These two types were chosen because the former are an
‘asocial’ representation, while the latter explicitly involve
social others. Moreover, they lead to different predictions in
the tasks we use.
Best-Response Model
   Best-response agents individually plan using a model of
other agents. This means that instead of reasoning about a
joint-policy directly, an agent i uses a predictive model of
another agent j’s policy, 𝜋! , to predict what j will do in a
certain state. That is, an agent i will construct a transition               Figure 1: Hallway Task examples where (a) agents pass on
