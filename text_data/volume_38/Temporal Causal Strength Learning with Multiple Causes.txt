Trial-By-Trial Accuracy of Predictions of the Effect
Given that participants were more likely to update their
beliefs about the causes that changed in the most recent trial
compared to those that did not, it is clear that transitions
play a role in temporal causal strength learning. Next we
analyzed the differences in accuracy for predicting the effect
on each trial. Recall that on each trial, participants were
asked to predict whether or not the patient would sleep well.
We predicted that participants in the IT condition would be
more accurate than those in the No-IT condition.
   We tested this using a logistic regression, predicting
accuracy on a given trial using trial number, condition (IT
vs No-IT), and an interaction between the two. We included
a by-subject random intercept and by-subject random slope
for trial number, allowing for individual differences in how
accuracy changes over the course of the trials. Figure 2
summarizes our findings: participants in the IT condition
improved more over time than participants in the No-IT
condition (B = 0.05, SE = 0.01, p < .01). This interaction
seems to come from the surprising finding that accuracy in           Figure 2: Accuracy of Trial-By-Trial Predictions of Effect

potentially allowing for a bigger difference between the two
conditions. However, the multiple regression weights were
still just as strong for the positive and negative causes.
   Another advantage of adding more causes in Experiment
2 is that an eight-cause scenario is even more difficult to
explain in terms of focal sets. As previously discussed, as
the number of causes increases, a smaller fraction of the
potential data would be included in any particular focal set.
   Importantly, the order of the trials does not matter for the
focal set account. By contrast, if participants use the IT
heuristic, they will perform better with more ITs.
