              Table 3: Definitions of dimensions as presented to participants in the instructions of the experiment.
  Dimension             Definition
  Surprisingness        Sometimes metaphors are used very naturally and do not seem surprising; in other cases, it can feel
                        like they come out of nowhere. This is the dimension of ‘surprisingness’ that we’d like you to rate.
  Comprehensibility     By this we simply mean, how easy or difficult it is to understand the statement. Some expressions
                        are easier to understand, like “My mother is a saint,” while others might be harder to understand “My
                        mother is a paperclip.”
  Conventionality       Expressions can also vary in how conventional they are for conveying the idea that they are supposed
                        to communicate. For example, consider the following two descriptions of a person running fast: a
                        conventional or common way, ‘he was running like the wind,’ and a much less conventional way, ‘he
                        was running like a Porsche on a German highway.’
  Metaphoricity         Finally, even metaphoric expressions may vary in how much they are figurative expressions rather than
                        literal. For example, if I say that the sun is a ball, someone might interpret that as being literally true
                        if they thought that ‘ball’ meant any object that was spherically shaped. Another person might think
                        the expression quite metaphorical because balls are toys, and the sun is not a toy. You will be asked
                        to judge the metaphoricity of the expressions below by indicating whether you find them to be very
                        metaphorical or close to literal.
  Aptness               Metaphors can vary in the extent to which they capture important features of the topic being described.
                        This is the dimension of ‘aptness.’ For instance, it would be apt to express that someone is a fast runner
                        by saying they are a rocket, but less apt to express that someone is a fast runner by saying they are an
