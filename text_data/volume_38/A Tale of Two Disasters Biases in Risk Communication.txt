   Experience Questions.
   In addition to the demographic and main experimental
questions, five questions captured participants’ real world
experience with the disasters they were asked about. The
first two of these asked: how many such events the
participant recalled having occurred in Adelaide; and how
many of those recalled events caused significant damage.
   Three questions asked about the disaster’s salience to the
participant. Specifically, whether: 1) the participant; 2) their
friends/family; or 3) people in their local area, had suffered
injury or property loss from such a disaster.
                                                                      Figure 1: Participant responses by familiarity and format.
