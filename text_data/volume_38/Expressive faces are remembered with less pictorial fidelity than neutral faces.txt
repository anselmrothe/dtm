The degree of pictorial fidelity with which a face is repre-
sented in memory can be measured with the continuous re-
port task (Wilken & Ma, 2004). Although this task has been
mostly employed with simple features (such as orientation
or color, for example), it can also be used with faces. In
the present study, participants were required to select a probe
within a morphing continuum in order to match it to a learned
face. This task was performed with face images belonging
to two different kinds of morphing continua. A first contin-
uum provided facial-identity variations with a neutral facial
expression. A second continuum provided emotional expres-
sions variations while keeping constant facial identity.
   In general, it’s not possible to directly compare distances
along different morphing continua, because there is not a
linear relation between the physical distance on such con-
tinua and the similarity space among the stimuli in the men-
tal memory representations (Caudek, 2013; Danilova & Mol-
lon, 2014). To deal with this problem, we generated the two
morphing continua with the technique of Fechnerian scaling,
which creates (for each participant) perceptually commensu-
rable spaces for identity and expression variations. In this
manner, the memory fidelity for the two classes of stimuli can
be directly compared because, in both cases, the unit of mea-
surement for each continuum corresponds to each subject’s
threshold of perceptual discrimination (Domini & Caudek,
2009; Dzhafarov & Colonius, 1999).                                  Figure 1: (a). Creation of the Identity Neutral continuum. A

ing continuum between two facial identities. We kept fixed
one image (origin of the scale) and then, with psychometric
methods, we selected a second face image which produced,
for each participant, an 82% success rate in a perceptual-
discrimination task. We then morphed this second image
with a third face identity and repeated the procedure (Figure
1a). In this manner, we selected, for each participant, four
face images (three pairs of images, each one characterized by
one threshold of perceptual discrimination). We then linearly
morphed each of the successive pairs of images, so as to gen-
erate the Fechnerian continuum for face-identity variations
(Figure 2a). A similar procedure was used for generating the
Fechnerian continuum for face-expressions variations (Figure
1b-c; 2b).                                                             Figure 2: Each Fechnerian morphing continuum was created,
