Figure 1: Trust, rate of return, and demand for the four conditions. The top two rows partners are randomly selected from the
full population, the bottom two rows they are only selected from adjacent neighbors. The top and third row the populations
of investors and investees are disjoint, the second and bottom row all agents play both roles. Values represent averages over
N = 1089 agents for the final 300 time cycles (of 1200), for each of 5 runs. Note that index colors do not indicate consistent
ranges, but rather vary by subfigure—see keys for values. See main text for interpretation.

Figure 2: Inequality as measured by the proportion of wealth held by the top 1% of investors for each of the four conditions;
values averaged as per Figure 1. Note that index color ranges are not consistent across subfigures, see keys. The only condition
of extreme inequality occurs when investors and investees are drawn from the same population, there is no partner choice
(although agents can still refuse to invest at all), and relatively high levels of information are available about potential investees.
Note that localised investment reduces the required level of information to generate inequality.

Figure 3: These simulations do not reach stable equilibria, but rather evolve dynamics that persistently converge in ways
determined by the socio-economic context. In this exemplar, chosen because of the correspondence to human levels of trust
and demand, the context is: the probability q = 0.5 of knowing a potential partner’s return rate (r), and the number of available
partners to choose between per game k = 3; investees are drawn from the same population as the investors (no castes); and they
are always drawn from the possible 8 immediate neighbors (spatially localized exchanges). The measured values are investee
return rate r, investor demand d and trust t—these are population averages (N = 1089); inequality is the proportion of overall
wealth held by the richest 1% of agents.
