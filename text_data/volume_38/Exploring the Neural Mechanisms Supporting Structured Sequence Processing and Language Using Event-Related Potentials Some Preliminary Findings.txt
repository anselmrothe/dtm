EEG/ERP Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
EEG was recorded during the test phase of the measure of
SSP and throughout the measure of language using a 128-
channel high-density sensor net with vertex recording
reference (Electrical Geodesics, Eugene OR). Standard
sensor net application techniques were followed. Recordings
were made using NetStation acquisition software (Electrical
Geodesics, Inc.), with a 0.1–100Hz bandpass filter and
digitized at 250 Hz. Electrode impedances were kept below
50 kiloohms. Rest breaks were given as needed.
   ERP for the measure of SSP was time-locked to the
presentation of a stimulus that violated the artificial
grammar and was compared to a stimulus in a similar
position in a sequence that was grammatical. ERP for the
measure of language was time-locked to the presentation of
a word in the sentence that violated the morpho-syntactic
grammar and was compared to a word in a similar position
in a sentence that was grammatical.
   Data was preprocessed using Netstation (Electrical
Geodesics, Inc.). The continuous raw EEG recording was           Figure 2: 2-D layout of the 128-channel sensor net (top is
