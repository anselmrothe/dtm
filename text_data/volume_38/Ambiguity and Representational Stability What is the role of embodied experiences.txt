   Our overall method was as follows: Adults were presented
with pairs of transparent objects that differed in size and
contained a certain number of weights, clearly visible to
participants. There were three phases: a pre-test, a training,
and a post-test. Each phase had the same prediction trials, the
difference being only in whether participants received
feedback (training) or not (pre-test, post-test). The crucial            Figure 1: Example trials. Star marks jar that sinks faster.

Material and Apparatus
Real-life sinking objects were used in this experiment,
dropped into a water tank to create feedback for adults’
predictions. The objects were transparent glass jars that
differed in their sizes. Round aluminum discs (43g) could be
placed inside the jars to manipulate mass. The water tank was
1m tall and had a vertical dividing wall to make it possible

Then they were provided with feedback pictures showing the
outcome of the jars after being dropped in water. Finally,
participants were shown the keypad and how it works. Prior
to the experiment proper, they were informed that the pictures
were taken from the real objects.
   For predictions with real-life objects (pre-test or post-test,
depending on condition), participants sat in front of an
opaque box (60 x 25 x 40 cm) that served as a table to hold
the objects. It also served as a barrier behind which the
