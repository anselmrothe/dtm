Abstract
The approximate number system (ANS) is frequently
considered to be a foundation for the acquisition of uniquely
human symbolic numerical capabilities.
However, the
mechanism by which the ANS influences symbolic number
representations and mathematical thought remains poorly
understood. Here, we tested the relation between ANS acuity,
cardinal number knowledge, approximate arithmetic, and
symbolic math achievement in a one-year longitudinal
investigation of preschoolers’ early math abilities. Our results
suggest that cardinal number knowledge is an intermediary
factor in the relation between ANS acuity and symbolic math
achievement.
Furthermore,
approximate
arithmetic
performance contributes unique variance to math achievement
that is not accounted for by ANS acuity. These findings
suggest that there are multiple routes by which the ANS
influences math achievement. Therefore, interventions
targeting both the precision and manipulability of the ANS
may prove to be more beneficial for improving mathematical
reasoning compared to interventions targeting only one of
these factors.

Introduction
In our information-driven society, math ability is essential
for success, particularly in the STEM fields that drive the
modern economy. However, within the population there
exists large variance in math ability, and low math
proficiency is associated with poor health and occupational
outcomes (e.g., Parsons & Bynner, 2006). Critically, math
ability when a child first enters schooling is the strongest
predictor of later math and overall academic achievement
(e.g., Duncan, Dowsett, & Claessens, 2007). Many
cognitive and socioeconomic factors are known to
contribute to individual differences in math achievement
(e.g., Bull & Scerif, 2001; Jordan, Kaplan, Ramineni, &
Locuniak, 2009; Klibanoff, Levine, Huttenlocher,
Vasilyeva, & Hedges, 2006). One of these factors is an
evolutionarily ancient system for representing approximate
quantities. Although educated humans typically think about
number using language, we also possess a system for
representing number in an approximate, nonsymbolic
fashion. This system, termed the approximate number
system (ANS), is not dependent on language or formal
schooling and is present in a wide variety of nonhuman

species (e.g., Dehaene, 1997; Gallistel & Gelman, 1992;
Hubbard et al., 2008).
The ANS is frequently hypothesized to be a cognitive
foundation for symbolic math abilities. Lending support to
this view is the pervasive finding that the acuity of the ANS,
typically measured by an individual’s ability to compare
two arrays of dots, correlates with symbolic math
achievement throughout the lifespan (see Chen & Li, 2013
for review, including failures to find this relation).
Importantly, ANS acuity prior to the beginning of formal
math instruction is predictive of later math achievement
(Libertus, Feigenson, & Halberda, 2013; Mazzocco,
Feigenson, & Halberda, 2011; Starr, Libertus, & Brannon,
2013; vanMarle, Chu, Li, & Geary, 2014). These studies
suggest that the precision of approximate number
representations may contribute to children’s acquisition of
symbolic math principles and influence symbolic math
performance throughout the lifespan.
Despite the many studies documenting a link between
ANS acuity and symbolic math, the mechanism underlying
this relation remains unclear. One possibility is that the
precision of the ANS influences children’s acquisition of
symbolic number representations. Before children can begin
learning symbolic arithmetic and other mathematical
operations, they must first learn the meaning of number
words and Arabic numerals. While there is debate over the
nature of the nonverbal representations that first ground the
meaning of number words (e.g., Carey, 2004; Gallistel &
Gelman, 1992), it is clear that sometime in early childhood,
children map number words onto approximate number
representations (Siegler & Opfer, 2003). Perhaps children
with more precise internal representations of numerical
quantities are at an advantage for forming these mappings,
which enables them to master the count list and counting
principles earlier than their peers with less precise internal
quantity representations (Starr et al., 2013; vanMarle et al.,
2014). In support of this view, preschoolers’ competence
with numerical symbols, and particularly their
understanding of cardinality, has been shown to mediate the
relation between their ANS acuity and math achievement
(vanMarle et al., 2014). Thus, the precision of the ANS may
influence the rate and fidelity with which children learn the
meaning of numerical symbols. Under this scenario, the
ANS may influence math achievement indirectly through its
connection to symbolic number representations – the ANS

1841

may be influential for grounding the meaning of numerical
symbols, but may not directly contribute to symbolic
mathematics (see also Lyons & Beilock, 2011).
A second hypothesis is that the manipulability of ANS
representations serves as an intuitive basis for symbolic
arithmetic (Barth, La Mont, Lipton, & Spelke, 2005). The
ANS enables human infants (McCrink & Wynn, 2004),
preschoolers (Barth et al., 2005; Gilmore, McCarthy, &
Spelke, 2010), and monkeys (Cantlon & Brannon, 2007) to
perform approximate arithmetic operations without the use
of symbols. Therefore, the ANS supports both quantity
representation and quantity manipulation. Children’s
approximate arithmetic performance at the beginning of
kindergarten is predictive of their symbolic math
achievement at the end of the academic year (Gilmore et al.,
2010). In addition, approximate arithmetic performance has
been found to mediate the relation between ANS acuity and
symbolic math achievement in grade-school children
(Pinheiro-Chagas et al., 2014). Furthermore, training
nonsymbolic arithmetic in adults leads to improvements in
their symbolic arithmetic performance (Park & Brannon,
2013; 2014). Thus, it may not be the precision of ANS
representations but instead the manipulability of ANS
representations that influences symbolic math achievement.
As a result, children who are more adept at manipulating
approximate quantities in arithmetic operations may also be
more adept at symbolic arithmetic because of the overlap in
cognitive processes required by both forms of arithmetic.
Critically, the above hypotheses need not be mutually
exclusive – it is possible that the ANS contributes to
symbolic math through multiple routes, including other
possibilities not listed above. For example, the ANS may
also influence symbolic math abilities through its
representation of numerical order (Lyons & Beilock, 2011),
or it may serve as an on-line error detection system,
enabling erroneous answers to be rejected in favor of more
plausible solutions (Lourenco, Bonny, Fernandez, & Rao,
2012). In addition, the relation between the ANS and
symbolic math is not necessarily static, and it is possible
that the ANS may contribute to symbolic math abilities in
different ways throughout development depending on the
child’s current level of math knowledge.
In the present research, we tested two possible pathways
through which the ANS may influence math abilities in a
longitudinal
investigation
of
preschoolers’
math
achievement. Children were tested at 3.5 years of age with a
nonsymbolic numerical comparison task, cardinal number
knowledge task, symbolic math test, and general IQ test.
One year later, when the same children were approximately
4.5 years of age, we tested them with a nonsymbolic
numerical comparison task, nonsymbolic approximate
arithmetic task, symbolic math test, and general IQ test.
Here we report how each of these measures contributes to
math achievement at 4.5 years of age, with a specific focus
on whether both the precision and manipulability of the
ANS influence math ability via number word knowledge
and approximate arithmetic.

Methods
Participants
Data from 97 children were included in the 3.5-year
analyses (mean age: 3.61 years, range: 3.50-3.89 years, 49
female). Data from 161 children were included in the 4.5year analyses (mean age: 4.56 years, range: 4.48-4.85 years,
86 female). Data from an additional 56 children at the 3.5year visit and 10 children at the 4.5-year visit were excluded
due to missing data points. Note that although the same
children were tested at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age, a greater
proportion of children had missing data points at 3.5 years,
resulting in a smaller sample size for analyses that involved
both the 3.5- and 4.5-year visit compared to analyses that
involved only the 4.5-year visit. The most common cause of
missing data points was an inability of our model to settle
on a value for w, and this affected a greater number of 3.5year-olds than 4.5-year-olds.

Procedure
Children came into the lab for two visits each lasting less
than one hour at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age. At the first 3.5year visit, children completed a symbolic math assessment
and one session of the nonsymbolic number comparison
task. During the second visit, 3.5-year-olds completed an IQ
assessment, the counting knowledge task, and a second
session of the nonsymbolic number comparison task. The
order of the tasks within each session was counterbalanced
across participants. At 4.5 years, during the first visit
children completed the symbolic math assessment, and one
session of the nonsymbolic number comparison task. During
the second visit, 4.5-year-olds completed the IQ assessment,
a second session of the nonsymbolic number comparison
task, and the nonsymbolic approximate arithmetic task. The
counting knowledge task was only administered at 3.5 years
because the majority of 4.5-year-olds perform at ceiling on
this task. The approximate arithmetic task was administered
only at 4.5 years because 3.5-year-olds were unable to
successfully perform the task. At each visit, parents gave
written consent to a protocol approved by the local
Institutional Review Board and were compensated
monetarily and with a small gift for the child.
Nonsymbolic Numerical Comparison Task On each trial,
a touchscreen computer displayed two bounded boxes (8 x
9.5 cm) containing arrays of dots. Children were instructed
to touch the box that contained more dots and to make this
choice without counting. Arrays contained between 4 and 14
dots, and the numerical ratio between the arrays was 1:2,
2:3, 3:4, or 6:7. To control for non-numerical perceptual
cues, the parameters of the arrays varied such that the
smaller and larger numerical array each had the larger
cumulative surface area on 50% of trials. All of the dots
within a single array were homogenous in element size and
color, and the color of each array varied randomly from trial
to trial. Differential audio-visual feedback was provided

1842

Counting Knowledge Task This task was modeled after
the Give-a-Number task (Wynn, 1992). The experimenter
introduced the child to a dinosaur puppet and asked the
child to give the dinosaur a certain number of fish by
placing them on a plate in front of the puppet. If the child
provided the correct number of fish, the trials progressed in
the order 1-3-5-6-6. If the child provided an incorrect
number of fish on any trial, the child was asked for N-1 fish.
The trials proceeded until the child answered correctly at
least twice for N and failed at least twice for N+1, or until
the child successfully provided six fish twice. The child’s
score was equal to this final value of N.

The first series of analyses examined the relation between
ANS acuity, as indexed by w, counting knowledge, and
future symbolic math achievement. First we confirmed that
ANS acuity at 3.5 years predicted symbolic math
achievement one year later at 4.5 years after controlling for
IQ (Figure 1). We performed a linear regression analysis
with w and IQ at 3.5 years entered as possible predictors of
math achievement at 4.5 years. Both w and IQ emerged as
significant predictors of math achievement (Table 1). In a
second regression model, we added counting knowledge as
an additional predictor. Consistent with the hypothesis that
counting knowledge may mediate the relation between w
and math achievement, when we added counting knowledge
to the model its contribution to TEMA was significant,
whereas w was no longer a significant predictor. In addition,
this model captured a larger proportion of variance than the
model without counting knowledge (F = 22.103, p < .001).
Further, when counting knowledge and IQ were used to
predict TEMA, the residuals did not account for significant
variation in w (F(1, 82) = 2.998, p = .09). This suggests that
ANS acuity is not directly impacting math performance but
instead may be acting via its influence on counting
proficiency.

Nonsymbolic Approximate Addition Task On each trial,
children viewed an animation that consisted of an array of
dots moving behind an occluder box, followed by a second
array moving behind the same occluder. This animated
arithmetic sequence lasted a total of 2000 ms. Children then
saw two boxes containing arrays of dots and were instructed
to touch the array that contained the same number of dots as
had moved behind the occluder box. Answer choices
remained on the screen until a decision was made. Correct
and incorrect answer choices differed by a 1:2 or 1:4 ratio,
and all choice arrays contained 2, 4, or 8 dots. Individual dot
size varied across arrays but was homogenous within each
array. Differential audiovisual feedback was provided after
each trial, and children were rewarded with a small sticker
for correct responses. Children performed practice trials
until they made three consecutive correct responses or
completed a maximum of ten trials. Children then
completed a total of 42 test trials.

after each trial, and children received a small sticker for
each correct response to keep them engaged. Children
performed practice trials until they made three consecutive
correct responses or completed a maximum of ten trials.
Children performed 60 test trials in each test session for a
total of 120 trials each time point.
To estimate each child’s ANS acuity, we used a
psychophysical modeling technique (e.g., Halberda &
Feigenson, 2008; Piazza et al., 2010) to calculate a Weber
fraction (w) based on performance in the nonsymbolic
numerical comparison task. The resulting value of w
represents the noise in each participant’s internal ANS
representations, such that lower values of w correspond to
less noise (i.e. higher ANS acuity).

Standardized Assessments Children’s mathematical ability
was assessed with the Test of Early Mathematics Ability
(TEMA-3) (Ginsburg & Baroody, 2003), which consists of
a series of verbally administered questions that assess ageappropriate counting ability, number-comparison facility,
numeral literacy, and basic calculation skills. To assess
general intelligence, children completed two verbal and two
nonverbal subtests of the Reynolds Intellectual Assessment
Scales (RIAS) (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2003). A composite
IQ score was calculated for each child.

The next series of analyses examined the relation between
w, approximate arithmetic performance, and symbolic math
achievement all at 4.5 years of age (Figure 2). We began by
performing a linear regression analysis to confirm that w
predicts math performance after controlling for IQ (Table
2). In the next regression model, we added approximate
arithmetic performance as another possible predictor. In this
model, all predictors contributed significant unique
variance, and this model explained significantly more
variance in math ability than the model without approximate
arithmetic (F = 9.438, p = .003). However, when
approximate arithmetic performance and IQ were regressed
on symbolic math achievement, these residuals were
significantly correlated with w (F(1, 141) = 4.674, p = .03).
Therefore, it appears that approximate arithmetic and ANS
acuity each contribute unique variance to symbolic math
performance at 4.5 years of age.

In a final combined model, we asked whether cardinal
number knowledge and approximate arithmetic performance
each contribute variance to children’s math achievement1.

w values from the 4.5-year visit were used because the values
at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age were significantly correlated (r = .31, p
< .01) and using the 4.5-year values enabled us to include a larger
proportion of our sample.

This model revealed that both factors make unique
contributions math achievement (F(4, 104) = 17.74, R2 =
.383, p < .001; Cardinal knowledge: β = .419, p < .001;
Approximate arithmetic: β = .196, p = .019; ANS acuity: β
= -.141, p = .082; IQ: β = .129, p = .116), which suggests
that both the precision of children’s ANS and their ability to
manipulate the ANS each impact symbolic math
achievement.

Discussion
The goal of the present research was to investigate the
mechanisms by which approximate number representations
contribute to preschoolers’ emerging symbolic math
capabilities. We first replicated previous findings (e.g.,
Libertus, Feigenson, & Halberda, 2011; Starr et al., 2013;
vanMarle et al., 2014) that individual differences in the
precision of the ANS are related to symbolic math
achievement in preschool-aged children. We found that
ANS acuity at age 3.5 was predictive of math achievement
one year later after controlling for general IQ. Next we
turned to quantitative abilities that may serve as
intermediary steps between the ANS and symbolic math.
We focused on cardinal number knowledge and
nonsymbolic approximate arithmetic, which are abilities that
have been previously found to correlate with symbolic math
performance in young children. Our results suggest that
there may be multiple routes by which the ANS contributes
to symbolic math achievement. With regards to the
precision of the ANS, it appears that ANS acuity may
indirectly influence math achievement via children’s
acquisition of numerical symbols and the cardinality
principle. In addition, nonsymbolic approximate addition
performance contributes unique variance above and beyond
that contributed by ANS precision. Together, these results
suggest that both the acuity and manipulability of the ANS
influence children’s early math performance.
Our finding that cardinal knowledge is an intermediary
step between the ANS and symbolic math is consistent with
prior work that has identified cardinal knowledge as a key
mediator of the relation between ANS acuity and math
achievement in preschool-aged children (Chu, vanMarle, &
Geary, 2015; vanMarle et al., 2014; see Schneider, Beeres,
Coban, & Merz, 2016 for meta-analysis). In this light, the
finding that symbolic numerical comparison is a stronger
predictor of symbolic math achievement than nonsymbolic
numerical comparison (Schneider et al., 2016) is not
necessarily a refutation of the idea that the ANS contributes
to symbolic math. Rather, cardinal representations of
symbolic numbers may serve as stepping-stones between
approximate number representations and symbolic
mathematical operations. When children begin to form
mappings between numerical symbols and approximate
quantities, the ease with which these mappings are formed
and the quality of these mappings may be influenced by the
precision of children’s ANS. Once this mapping is formed
and children become proficient with numerical symbols, the

1844

precision of the ANS itself may not directly impact math
achievement.
In the present study we focused on children’s
understanding of cardinality. Therefore, although our results
point towards the importance of cardinal number knowledge
for early math proficiency, it remains to be seen how other
forms of symbolic number knowledge, including ordinality,
may relate to math ability. Indeed, symbolic numerical
ordering ability has been found to mediate the relation
between ANS acuity and symbolic math achievement in
adults (Lyons & Beilock, 2011). However, a recent training
study with adults found that training adults on a symbolic
numeral ordering task did not produce gains in symbolic
arithmetic ability (Park & Brannon, 2014). Additional work
is therefore needed to investigate how the ANS supports
symbolic number representations throughout the lifespan,
particularly after children have mastered cardinality, and
how this relation contributes to symbolic math achievement.
The present results also provide support for a second
route by which the ANS influences math ability. Beyond
basic quantity representation, the ANS also supports
arithmetic operations in infants, preschool children, and
monkeys, all of whom have no understanding of symbolic
arithmetic (Barth et al., 2005; Cantlon & Brannon, 2007;
McCrink & Wynn, 2004). This capacity may provide an
intuitive basis for the acquisition of symbolic arithmetic
principles. Consistent with this view, we found that
approximate arithmetic ability in 4.5-year-olds was a
significant predictor of performance on the TEMA, which is
primarily composed of symbolic numerical problems.
Further, approximate arithmetic ability predicted unique
variance in TEMA scores that was not accounted for by
ANS acuity. As evidenced by a recent series of training
studies, the link between approximate and symbolic
arithmetic extends into adulthood: training adults on a
nonsymbolic arithmetic task similar to that employed here
led to significant gains in their symbolic arithmetic
performance. (Park & Brannon, 2013; 2014). Critically,
training on other types of tasks, including nonsymbolic
numerical comparison, did not transfer to symbolic
arithmetic. Although both nonsymbolic numerical
comparison and approximate arithmetic tasks require
representing approximate numerical quantities, approximate
arithmetic additionally requires the manipulation of those
quantities. This manipulation component appears to be a
critical factor in the relation between the ANS and symbolic
math.
The majority of studies relating the approximate number
system to symbolic math have focused on individual
differences in the acuity of approximate number
representations. However, the manipulability of these
representations may be a second mechanism by which the
ANS influences symbolic math. Approximate arithmetic
may share a cognitive foundation with symbolic arithmetic,
making it an attractive target for potential interventions to
remediate deficits in math proficiency. A priority for future
studies should therefore be to adapt these training paradigms

for children and determine if improving children’s
approximate arithmetic abilities also produces benefits for
symbolic math. In addition, the relation between the
precision and manipulability of the ANS remains relatively
unexplored and is deserving of further study.
The ANS endows young children with a robust sense of
quantity prior to beginning formal mathematics training.
Although many studies have provided evidence for a
correlation between the fidelity of the ANS and symbolic
math achievement, there remain key open questions
concerning the mechanisms underlying this relation and
whether this correlation is indicative of a causal relation. In
the present study, we identified two potential pathways
through which the ANS influences preschoolers’ early math
proficiency. The first role for the ANS may occur when
children are beginning to learn the meaning of number
words, at which point approximate number representations
may serve as an anchor for acquiring symbolic number
representations. Therefore, the precision of the ANS may
influence children’s facility with mapping numerical
symbols to approximate magnitudes. A second role for the
ANS may stem from its ability to support arithmetic
operations. The shared demand for manipulating quantities
may form a conceptual bridge between nonsymbolic and
symbolic arithmetic. The present results therefore suggest a
nuanced
relation
between
approximate
number
representations and symbolic math achievement in which
multiple features of the ANS contribute to the emergence of
symbolic math ability in young children. In light of these
results, interventions designed to target one or both of these
pathways may be differentially beneficial for children
depending on their level of symbolic number knowledge
and mathematical proficiency.
