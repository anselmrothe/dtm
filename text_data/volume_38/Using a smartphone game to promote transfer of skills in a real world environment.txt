to better transfer. Level20 is the highest level reached after 20
minutes. This tests whether initial progress on the tasks can
predict the amount of transfer. Level120 is the highest level
reached after 120 minutes. This tests whether progress made
in the minimum amount of time subjects had to train pre-

Level120. This tests more or less the same as just Level120,

looking at the influence of Tetris on the accuracy score of the

on the task, the correlations were calculated. Table 2 shows
the influence of previously discussed variables on the im-
provement in the Stroop task. In the Wollie group both Diff-
Level and HighScore have a negative significant influence on
the improvement. This means that the lower the DiffLevel
or Highscore, the higher the improvement on the task. For
Tetris no significant correlations were found. In figure 4 the
significant negative correlation between DiffLevel and the im-
provement in accuracy can be seen. The correlation of -0.42
(p=0.03) means that 17.6% of the improvement on the task
can be assigned to the DiffLevel variable. This figure also
shows us that subjects who improved greatly in Wollie, were
also likely to score high on the first Stroop task session.
Task Switching
In the Task Switching data we excluded one person in the
control group who had a switch-cost of 2182 ms. Figure 5
shows the average pre and post switch-costs for each group.
