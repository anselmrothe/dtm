Thus, the velocity, duration, and shape of participants’
mouse trajectories revealed real-time competition between
alternative referents as they made their selection.
   When participants select a referent for a word in a cross-
situational learning task, do they experience real-time
competition between referents that previously co-occurred
with the word? To test this question, we devised novel
