Abstract
What accounts for the vast diversity in the world’s languages?
We explore one possibility: languages adapt to their linguistic environment (Linguistic Niche Hypothesis; Lupyan & Dale,
2010). Recent studies have found support for this hypothesis
through correlations between aspects of the environment and
linguistic structure. We synthesize this previous work and find
that languages spoken in cold, small regions tend to be more
complex across a range of linguistic features. We also test
a novel prediction of the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis by examining the learnability of languages for first-language, child
learners.
Keywords: Linguistic Niche Hypothesis; language evolution

Introduction
What factors shape language? Psychologists have made significant progress understanding this question in the domains
of communicative interaction and children’s developmental
trajectories. In both cases, accounts rely on positing two pressures on the cognitive system—one internal and one external.
In the case of communication, theorists argue that speakers
are influenced by cognitive constraints (minimize effort) and
by the needs of the communicative partner (be understandable; Horn, 1984). In the case of acquisition, there are internal maturational constraints, as well as external pressures
from the quality and quantity of linguistic input (Hart & Risley, 1995). In the present paper, we explore the possibility
that the same two pressures—system internal and external—
may also shape language systems over the course of language
evolution.
Central to this hypothesis is the notion of a timescale:
there are different units of time over which processes operate,
and processes at shorter timescales influence those at longer
timescales (Blythe, 2015, see also Fig. 1). At the shortest
timescale are individual utterances in communicative interactions (pragmatics). At a longer timescale is language acquisition. Both experimental and modeling work suggest that
communicative interactions at the pragmatic timescale influence processes like word learning at the acquisition timescale
(e.g., Baldwin, 1991; McMurray, Horst, & Samuelson, 2012;
Frank, Goodman, & Tenenbaum, 2009; Frank & Goodman,
2014).
In addition to pragmatics and acquisition, a third relevant
timescale is language evolution: the timescale over which entire language systems change. As for acquisition, there is evidence that language systems may be the product of processes
at the pragmatic timescale. For example, languages universally structure semantic space to reflect optimal equilibria between communicative pressures (e.g., Kemp & Regier, 2012;
Regier, Kay, & Khetarpal, 2007; Baddeley & Attewell, 2009).

However, the presence of communicative pressures at the
pragmatic timescale is unable to explain cross-linguistic variability in linguistic structure. That is, why does Polish have
rich morphology but English relatively sparse? A growing
body of work argues that this variability may be due to cognitive constraints internal to the language learner (Chater &
Christiansen, 2010) as well as properties of the environmental
context (Nettle, 2012). This hypothesis, termed the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis (Lupyan & Dale, 2010; Wray & Grace,
2007), suggests that language systems adapt to the internal
and external pressures of the linguistic environment.
A number of recent studies provide correlational support
for this proposal. At the lowest level of the linguistic hierarchy, languages with larger populations are claimed to have
larger phonemic inventories (Atkinson, 2011; Hay & Bauer,
2007), but shorter words (Wichmann, Rama, & Holman,
2011). Speakers with more second language learners have
also been suggested to have fewer lexical items (Bentz, Verkerk, Kiela, Hill, & Buttery, 2015). At the level of morphology, speakers with larger populations tend to have simpler
morphology (Lupyan & Dale, 2010; Bentz & Winter, 2013).
Finally, there is also evidence that population size may influence the mappings between form and meaning. In particular,
this work suggests that languages tend to map longer words to
more complex meanings (Lewis, Sugarman, & Frank, 2014),
but that this bias is smaller for languages with larger populations (Lewis & Frank, 2016).
The plausibility of the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis depends largely on the presence of a possible mechanism linking environmental features to aspects of language systems. A
range of proposals have been suggested (Nettle, 2012). For

Figure 1: Pressures on language, internal and external to the
cognitive system at three different timescales. The Linguistic
Niche Hypothesis suggests that language evolution is influenced by the internal and external pressures in the particular
environmental context in which a language is spoken.

example, one possibility is that children (L1) and adult (L2)
language-learners differ in their learning constraints. In particular, children may be better at acquiring complex morphology than adults, and so languages with mostly children learners may tend to have more complex morphology. A second
possibility is that speakers in less dense social networks have
less variable linguistic input, and this leads the language system to have more complex morphology.
Providing evidence for these mechanisms is empirically
challenging, however. Because there are many factors that
shape a linguistic system, large datasets are needed to detect a correlation with environmental factors. In addition,
there is non-independence across languages due to genetic
relationships and language contact, and so data from a wide
range of languages are needed to control for these moderators
(Jaeger, Graff, Croft, & Pontillo, 2011). Third, the hypothesized mechanisms linking languages to their environments
are somewhat underspecified. Finally, the large scale of this
hypothesis makes it difficult to directly intervene on, and so
we must rely primarily on correlational data to make inferences about mechanism.
In this work, we try to address some of these challenges by
clarifying the empirical landscape. We do this by aggregating
across datasets that find covariation between environmental
variables and linguistic structure. This serves two purposes.
First, it allows us to examine the relationship between the
same set of environmental predictors across a range of linguistic features. And, second, it allows for the same analytical
techniques and areal controls to be used across datasets. By
addressing these inconsistencies, we are better able to compare directly relationships between environmental and linguistic features. A more coherent picture of the empirical
landscape may in turn provide insight into the mechanism
linking language systems to their environments.
We also explore a novel aspect of the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis: the relationship between L1 and L2 learnability. We
ask whether the same languages that are more easily learnable by second language learners are also easier to learn for
first language learners, or whether there is some tradeoff in
learnability. As a proxy a language’s learnability for childlearners, we use the mean age of acquisition of children’s first
words in a language.
In what follows, we first present a study examining the relationship between environmental and linguistic features using the same analytical techniques across all variables (Study
1). In Study 2, we examine the relationship between first language learnability and environmental and linguistic features.

Study 1: Environmental pressures on language
The Linguistic Niche Hypothesis suggests that languages are
shaped by their environment, but the exact nature of these
effects has varied across the literature—both in terms of the
variables considered and the direction of the effect. To explore this variation, we combined data from five existing
datasets that included environmental or linguistic data. The

datasets were selected for being publicly available and containing a large sample of languages. Below we describe each
of these datasets, followed by our analytical methods, and results.

Datasets
Lupyan and Dale (2010). This dataset contains grammatical
information from WALS (Dryer & Haspelmath, 2013), and
demographic and geographic information from Ethnologue
and the Global Mapping Institute (Gordon, 2005). The demographic and geographic variables included total population of
speakers, number of neighboring languages, area of region
in which the language is spoken (km2 ), mean and standard
deviation temperature (celsius), and mean and standard deviation precipitation (cm). We used these data to create a metric of morphosyntactic complexity calculated from 27 of the
28 morphosyntactic variables analyzed in the original paper.1
For each variable, we coded the strategy as simple if it relied
on a lexical strategy or few grammatical distinctions (e.g., 03 noun cases), and complex if it relied on a morphological
strategy or many grammatical distinctions (e.g., more than 3
noun cases). We summed the number of complex strategies
to derive a measure of morphosyntactic complexity for each
language, including only languages with data for all 27 variables. [n = 1991 languages]
Bentz et al. (2015). Two variables were used from this
dataset: ratio of L2 to L1 speakers and number of word forms.
Estimates of number of word forms were taken from translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Number of word forms was calculated as the number of unique
words divided by the number of total words (type-token ratio). Higher type-token ratio indicates more word types in
that language. Speaker population data were taken from a variety of sources, where L2 speakers were restricted to adult
non-native speakers only. [n = 81]
Moran, McCloy and Wright (2012). Estimates of number
of consonants and vowels in each language were used from
this dataset. [n = 969]
Lewis and Frank (2014). This work finds that languages
tend to map more complex meanings (measured via semantic
norms) to longer words. The bias is estimated as the correlation (Pearson’s r) between word length and complexity
ratings for a set of 499 words translated via Google Translate. We used estimates of the correlation that partialed out
the effect of spoken frequency. [n = 79]
Wichmann, Rama, and Holman (2014). This database contains translations for 40-lexical items across many languages.
Word length was calculated as the mean number of characters
in the ASJPcode transcription system across words in each
language. [n = 4421]
Aggregating across datasets, we analyzed 8 environmental variables in total: L2-L1 population ratio, total population
size, number of neighbors, area of spoken region, mean and
standard deviation temperature, and mean and standard de1 WALS

viation precipitation. These variables were selected from a
larger set because they were not highly correlated with each
other (r < .8). We analyzed 6 total linguistic variables: number of vowels, number of consonants, word length, type-token
ratio, complexity bias, and morphosyntactic complexity.

Method
Datasets were merged using common ISO-639 codes when
available. Five variables were log-transformed to better approximate a normal distribution (population, L2 to L1 ratio,
number of neighbors, area, number of consonants, number of
vowels).2
Main analysis We tested for a linear relationship between
each environmental and language variable. A significant
challenge in making inferences about language data is nonindependence. This non-independence can come from at least

two sources: genetic relatedness and language contact. Following Jaeger et al. (2011), we control for these factors statistically by using linear mixed-effects regression. We control
for genetic non-independence by including a random intercept and slope by language family. We control for language
contact by including country of origin as a random intercept
(models with random slopes failed to converge).3 We selected
country of origin as a proxy for linguistic community because
it was available for all languages in our dataset. Both control
variables were taken from the WALS dataset. We considered
a predictor significant if the test statistic on the fixed effect
coefficient exceeded 1.96.

Component loading

Figure 3: Languages spoken in cold, small regions tend to be more complex. The bar plots show the loadings on the first
two principal components for the environmental variables (n = 7; orange) and language variables (n = 5; green). The scatter
plots show the relationship between the first two principal components for both sets of variables. Each point corresponds to
a language, and lines show the linear fit from the mixed effect model. Significance and direction of a linear relationship are
indicated by the coloring of the scatterplot (blue: significant and negative; red: significant and positive).
variables that have been used to test the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis. However, the large number of variables makes it
difficult to distill a coherent picture from these data. Given
that many of these variables are partially correlated with each
other, we used a technique for reducing the dimensionality
of the dataset—principal component analysis. We found the
principal components associated with the variance for the environmental variables and the linguistic variables, and then fit
the same model as in the primary analysis using the rotated
values. Complexity bias was excluded because it was only
available for a small subset of languages. All variables were
scaled.

Results
In the main analysis, we fit mixed effect models predicting
each language variable with each environmental variable using areal controls. The results are presented in Figure 2. For
each language variable, there was at least one environmental variable that reliably covaried, though some previouslyreported effects were not significant in this analysis. We return to this in the discussion. Data can be explored interactively here: https://mlewis.shinyapps.io/lhnn/.
The principal component analysis revealed two primary
components of variance for both the environmental and lin-

guistic variables. For the environmental variables, the first
two principal components accounted for .69 of the total variance (PC1: .39; PC2: .30). The weights on these variables
across the two components can be seen in the upper panel of
Fig. 3. The first component loads most heavily on variables
related to the climate. It can be thought of as corresponding to hot and rainy regions. The second component loads
most heavily on variables related to the size of the region a
language is spoken in, both in terms of number of speakers
and physical size. This principal component can be roughly
interpreted as the ‘smallness’ of a linguistic community.
For the linguistic variables, the first two components also
accounted for most of the variance, .70 (PC1: .39; PC2: .31;
right panel of Fig. 3). The first component loads positively
on all variables, except number of vowels. In particular, this
component is associated with more consonants, longer words,
more word types, and greater morphosyntactic complexity.
Broadly, this component is related to the amount of cognitive
difficulty associated with learning a language. The second
component is associated with having short words, but large
phonemic inventories.
Figure 3 shows the relationship between the principal components. Both environmental principal components were reliable predictors of the first linguistic principal component

(PC1: b = 0.56, t = 3.52; PC2: b = 0.47, t = 2.08).
This suggests that languages that tend to be spoken in cold
and small regions are more likely to be more complex. Neither of the environmental principal components were reliable
predictors of the second linguistic principal component.

languages. To evaluate the validity of this measure, we compared these ratings to more objective measures of AoA collected from parent-report using the CDI (Wordbank; Frank,
Braginsky, Yurovsky, & Marchman, in press). We fit a model
predicting the objective ratings with the subjective ratings
for the small sample of common languages (n = 7). We included language as a random by-intercept and by-slope effect. Subjective ratings were a strong predictor of objective
ratings (b = 1.00, t = 5.45), suggesting that the Łuniewska et
al. (2015) norms were a reasonable proxy for cross-linguistic
AoA.
We averaged across words in the Łuniewska et al. (2015)
database to get a mean AoA for each language. We then used
the same mixed-effect model as in Study 1 to predict AoAs
with each of the linguistic and environmental variables analyzed in Study 1.

Discussion
These two analyses suggest that more complex languages are spoken in cold, small regions. Importantly,
we find this relationship across a range of linguistic
features—morphosyntactic complexity, linguistic diversity,
word length, and consonant inventory—using the same analytic technique across all measures.
This finding is broadly consistent with previous work that
finds relationships between individual metrics of complexity
and various demographic variables. Nevertheless, we find
null effects for several reported relationships in the literature.
For example, the relationship between population size and
morphosyntactic complexity (Lupyan & Dale, 2010) is not reliable in our model with areal controls, though the correlation
is significant (r =.08; p <.001) and we replicate their finding
in a binned analysis (Fig. 3 of Lupyan & Dale, 2010). There
are many possible reasons for these differences (e.g., different
measure of complexity, different areal controls), highlighting
the need for a common analytical approach across datasets.
Why might languages in small, cold regions have more
complex languages? One possible mechanism is that languages spoken in larger places have more L2 learners, and
that L2 learners are less skilled than L1 learners at acquiring complex language. As a result, these languages adapt by
simplifying. The relationship between climate and linguistic
complexity is less clear, but one possibility is that speakers
in colder regions are less itinerant, and therefore have less
contact with adult speakers of other languages.

Results
Number of consonants positively predicted AoA, suggesting
that languages with more consonants tend to have later AoAs
(b = 1.04, t = 1.97). In addition, temperature positively predicted AoA (b = .13, t = 2.57) and variability in precipitation
negatively predicted AoA (b = 1.6, t = 2.83). No other
variables were significant predictors of AoA.

Discussion

Study 2: Variability in L1 learning
The proposed mechanism in Study 1 makes an important assumption: L2 learners, but not L1 learners, are poor learners
of linguistic complexity. Lupyan and Dale (2015) have argued that morphological complexity in fact facilitates learning for L1 learners by providing redundancy in the linguistic
signal. A straightforward prediction of this hypothesis is that
languages that are more easily learnable by L2 learners will
be less learnable by L1 learners.
In Study 2, we explore this prediction. As a proxy for language learnability for L1 learners, we use the mean age of acquisition (AoA) of words in a language by L1 learners (children). If there is a tradeoff between learnability for L1 and
L2 learners, languages that are less complex should be harder
for children to learn, and thus have later AoAs.

Method
We use subjective measures of AoA from the the Łuniewska
et al. (2015) norms. These AoAs were collected from adult
participants for the translation equivalents of 299 words in 25

Study 2 explores a prediction about a mechanism for the relationship between population size and linguistic complexity:
L1 learning is facilitated by complexity in the linguistic signal
(via redundancy), but L2 learning is hindered. We find only
limited support for this proposal. Of the factors that loaded on
“complexity” in the principal component analysis in Study 1,
number of consonants was the only reliable predictor of AoA.
Nevertheless, we do find several surprising correlates of
AoA—number of consonants, temperature, and precipitation
variability—even in this very small sample of languages. The
mechanism underlying these relationships is not clear. It
could be for example that L1 learners in colder regions have
more language input, and therefore earlier AoAs. Or, if we
assume that temperature and variability in precipitation are
proxies from L2 pressure (as suggested in Study 1), it could
be that languages with more L2 pressure have later AoAs, and
therefore are harder for L1 learners to acquire. A larger sample of languages will be needed to address these questions.

Conclusion
Languages vary in many ways across multiple timescales of
analysis. Here we suggest that this variability can be accounted for by considering the relationship between these
timescales and two types of pressures, those internal and external to the cognitive system. In the present work, we have
explored a hypothesis at the language evolution timescale—
the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis—which suggests that crosslinguistic variability is the result of different cognitive constraints of learners and environmental pressures.

We contribute to the empirical findings related to this hypothesis by synthesizing previous correlational evidence using common analytical techniques across datasets. Across a
range of linguistic and environmental metrics, we find that
more complex languages tend to be spoken in smaller, colder
regions. We also find evidence that the learnability of a language for L1 learners may be related to aspects of the language (number of consonants) and the environment (temperature and variability in precipitation). Understanding how both
child and adult learners shape language systems is an important question for future work.
Accounting for variability at the timescale of language evolution is an empirically challenging enterprise. Moving forward, we suggest that a fruitful avenue for progress is holistic
descriptions of the empirical landscape, and appeals to processes at multiple timescales of analysis.
