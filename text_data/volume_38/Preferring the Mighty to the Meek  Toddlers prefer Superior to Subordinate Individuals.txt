Abstract

(Boehm, 1999; Fiske, 1992), and across human social
settings (e.g., academic, domestic, recreational,
professional) (Magee & Galinsky, 2008).
The ubiquity of social hierarchies means that it is
important that individuals can recognize relative social rank.
Indeed, natural selection has conferred this ability on many
species, including fish, birds, chimps, wolves, and humans
(Bond, Wei, & Kamil, 2010; Grosenick, Clement, & Fernald,
2007; Sapolsky, 2004).
In humans, the ability is present very early on:
preverbal infants expect larger agents and agents with more
allies to win right-of-way dominance contests (Thomsen,
Frankenhuis, Ingold-Smith, & Carey, 2011; Pun, Birch, &
Baron, 2016). They also expect rank to be transitive (i.e., they
expect that if A outranks B, and B outranks C, then A will
outrank C) (Gazes, Hampton, & Lourenco, 2015, see also
Mascaro, Csibra, 2014) and expect that those who have won
dominance contests in the past (e.g. over resources) will win
new dominance contests (e.g. over territory) (Mascaro &
Csibra, 2012.)
Such studies demonstrate that infants use
dominance cues found across phylogenesis to detect
hierarchical relationships. But to survive and thrive in
human society, detection of rank is not enough; individuals
must also use this information to motivate their own
behavior toward others. For example, they must evaluate
social situations to decide which individuals to approach
and which to avoid, and which to form relationships with.

Every human society includes social hierarchies—
relationships between individuals and groups of unequal rank
or status. Recent research has shown that even preverbal
infants represent hierarchical relationships, expecting larger
agents and agents from larger groups to win dominance
contests. However, to successfully navigate social hierarchies,
infants must also integrate information about social rank into
their own behavior, such as when deciding which individuals
to approach and which to avoid. Here we demonstrate that twoyear-old children (ages 21-31 months) preferred novel
dominant agents to subordinates. That is, by the age of 21
months, toddlers not only use phylogenetically stable cues to
predict the winner of dominance contests, they also like the
dominant agents better. This finding suggests that young
children use their ability to infer relative rank to selectively
approach dominant individuals.

Introduction
Humans are ultra-social species. A person’s ability to
interpret, create, and maintain social relationships is key to
his or her physical and mental well-being (Silk, 2007). One
very common type of social relationship occurs between
individuals who are ranked along some linear dimension
such as age, military rank, physical size, etc. (Fiske &
Schubert, 2012; Fiske, 1992; Kaufmann & Clément, 2014;
Sapolsky, 2004). Such hierarchical relationships are found
across species (Sapolsky, 2004), across human societies

241

One reason to expect that children might behave
differently toward high- vs. low-ranked individuals comes
from observations in daycare centers (Sluckin & Smith,
1977). Toddlers are deferent to peers that outrank them, and
assertive towards those they outrank. Furthermore, toddlers
who take contested toys or thwart other children tend to be
preferred playmates and are more likely to influence and be
imitated by other children, and rank between two children
often remains stable across time (see Hawley, 2015 for
review; Sluckin & Smith, 1977).
While this indicates that children do integrate rank
into their behavior, it could simply reflect a history of
interactions between individual children (e.g. a child might
think, “I fought with this kid yesterday over a toy and lost; I
don’t want to go through that again, so now I will just give
him the toy.”) This leaves open the question of whether
children possess a ‘default’ core motivational system that
specifies how to relate to novel individuals depending on
their social rank.
For example, it has been argued that detecting
social rank is adaptive because it allows infants (and
animals) to ‘size up the competition’ and avoid dangerous
conflicts they are unlikely to win (e.g. Pun et al., 2016). And
in fact, the ability to avoid dominant individuals is
associated with lower stress levels in other species
(Sapolsky, 2005). For example, subordinate wolves in
captivity, who cannot easily avoid dominant wolves, have
elevated stress hormones compared to subordinate wolves in
the wild. If avoiding dominant individuals is the main
benefit of detecting rank, then we might expect children in
the present study to avoid the novel high-ranking individual.
However, insofar as dominance rank reflects
success in one’s ecological context, affiliating with highranking individuals might bring benefits in the form of
access to important know-how, (Chudek, Heller, Birch, &
Henrich, 2012; Henrich & Gil-White, 2001), material
resources, and control (Thomsen & Carey, 2013).
Consistent with this proposal, macaques use rank to decide
whom to align with when facing opponents, and they
consistently choose allies who outrank themselves and their
opponents (Silk, 1999).
The present study was a first step toward testing
whether human children evaluate novel individuals according
to their relative social ranks—motivating them to either
approach or avoid them. Experiment 1 used a proven rightof-way paradigm (Thomsen et al., 2011, replicated in Pun et
al, 2016) to establish that one individual in a dyad was ranked
higher than the other. We then tested whether children ages
21-31 months prefer the dominant individual or the
subordinate, using a well-established reaching paradigm
(Hamlin, Wynn, & Bloom, 2007; Hamlin, Wynn, Bloom, &
Mahajan, 2011). Experiment 2 followed up results from
Experiment 1, showing children a scene that was similar but
lacked any interaction between the characters. This ruled out
a number of alternative explanations for the results of
Experiment 1, including the explanation that toddlers may
prefer the individual that reaches its goal, the individual that

moves last or moves farthest, or the individual that stays
upright throughout the scene.

Experiment 1
Methods
Participants
Participants were recruited at a children’s museum. A total of
30 children participated in the experiment. Of these, 8 were
excluded from the analysis for the following reasons:
Refusing to choose a puppet (n=4); Choosing both puppets
(n=2); Extreme fussiness (n=1); Distraction in the testing
environment (a janitor entered the testing room and made
loud noises, n=1). The remaining 22 children (9 girls, 13
boys) contributed data to the analysis. Their ages ranged from
21-31 months (M=24.95 months (SD=2.92 months). At the
time of enrollment in the study, parents were asked to fill out
a demographic questionnaire asking about the child’s race
and ethnicity, and their household income. Responses to the
race/ethnicity questions included the following: White, Not
Hispanic (n=11); Asian, Not Hispanic (n=6); Asian and
White, Not Hispanic (n=2); White, Mexican-American (n=1)
and Mexican-American, no race indicated (n=2).
We stopped at n=22 because we had a sufficiently
strong Bayes Factor (see analysis below). Although
frequentist statistical analyses do not allow for preferential
stopping, Bayesian analyses do (Csibra et al., 2016; Dienes,
2011).
Materials & Procedure
The puppet stage used in all experiments was 75cm tall,
32.5cm deep, and 95cm long. It was placed on a folding table
covered with black fabric. There were black curtains attached
to the left and right side of the puppet stage, and a black
curtain was used to cover the stage between scenes. Another
black curtain behind the stage hid the experimenter who was
manipulating the puppets. The puppets were 12.5cm tall and
made of clay. They each had one plastic craft eye (with a
fixed pupil so that the puppet always seemed to be looking
straight ahead) and a black rectangle for a mouth. One puppet
was a yellow oval and one was a red rectangle; the shapes
were equal in diameter. The puppets were moved by means
of black wooden dowels attached to their bases. The
experimenter administering the puppet show wore black
gloves and black clothing, and was hidden from the child’s
view. After the puppet show, two puppets identical to those
used in the puppet show were presented to the child on a
white foam board measuring 60 x 90cm. The puppets were
placed on the board 75cm apart, and were attached to the
board with magnets.
Participants were recruited from the floor of a
children’s museum during regular business hours. Parents

242

were approached by an
experimenter who greeted
the parent and asked if
they would like to hear
more information about an
experiment on children’s
understanding of social
relationships. If the parent
agreed, they were given
the consent form and
demographic
questionnaire to fill out
while the experimenter
interacted with the child
before leading the parent
and child to a testing room.
The testing room was a
large room off the main
floor of the museum.
Before entering the testing
room, parents were briefed
about the procedure. They
were asked to remain quiet
during the puppet show
and to close their eyes
Figure 1: Puppet Show
during
the
choice
used in Experiment 1
procedure.
The
participating child usually
sat on the parent’s lap. When this was not possible (e.g.,
because the parent was holding a younger sibling), the child
sat in a chair next to their parent.
After the parent and child were seated in the testing
room, the child was shown the puppet show. One
experimenter (occluded from the child’s view) acted as the
puppeteer. A second experimenter who was blind to the
condition (i.e. could not see which puppet was the dominant
puppet and which was the subordinate) stood beside the stage
and moved the curtain up and down between segments,
saying “down goes the curtain” when pulling the curtain
down, and “up goes the curtain” when pulling the curtain up.
Following Thomsen, et al, (2011), during the
familiarization sequence, one puppet, alone on stage, crossed
the stage two times (both times in the same direction). Then
the other puppet, also alone, crossed the stage two times in
the opposite direction. The direction that the higher and
lower-ranked puppet traveled was counterbalanced, along
with which puppet crossed the stage first and which puppet
was higher ranked (i.e. yellow oval or red square), In the
hierarchy display sequence the two puppets appeared on
opposite sides of the stage and started across at the same time,
meeting in the middle. Upon meeting, both puppets backed
up and tried again, only to meet again in the middle. After
this meet-and-retreat sequence was repeated three times, the
puppets approached one another, this time without touching
(so it did not look like the lower-ranked puppet was being

knocked over). Next, the lower-ranked puppet bowed down
and moved aside, allowing the other puppet (the high-ranked
puppet) to pass by. The entire hierarchy display sequence was
repeated three times.
Following Hamlin et al, 2007, during the choice
procedure, the second experimenter (who was blind to the
condition) reminded the parent to close his or her eyes. The
experimenter then retrieved the board with the puppets
attached to it, and held it so that the child could see (but not
reach) the puppets. The experimenter looked at the child and
said, “Hi!” then said, “Look!” and looked down at the board,
fixing her gaze directly in the center of the board, between
the two puppets. Finally, the experimenter said, “Which one
do you like?” and pushed the board toward the child so that
the child could reach it. The experimenter mentally counted
off 30 seconds. If the child had not made a choice after 30
seconds, the experimenter (keeping her gaze fixed on the
center of the board) encouraged the child by saying, for
example, “Its ok to choose one,” or “You can grab one.”) If
the child still made no choice, the experimenter returned the
board back to its starting position and repeated the choice
process. If the choice procedure was done three times and the
child still made no choice, then the trial was coded ‘no
response.’
After the puppet show, each child was given a prize
(i.e. a rubber duck). Parents were invited to ask questions
about the study and were given information about the lab to
take home. Two research assistants who were blind to
condition coded each video for choice. There were no
disagreements between the two coders.

Results and Discussion
Of the 22 children who contributed data to the analysis, 18
chose the ‘high-ranked’ or ‘dominant’ puppet (as established
by the hierarchy-display sequence of the puppet show). To
compare the observed distribution (i.e. 18/22) to an expected
distribution (i.e. assuming that children choose the highranked 50% of the time), we used ‘binom.test’ in the
statistical program ‘R’ (p=.004344, estimated probability of
success = .8182). We also used a Bayes Factor Binomial
calculator (http://pcl.missouri.edu/bf-binomial) and found
that the odds of the alternative model (i.e. the children were
choosing the high-ranked either more or less than 50% of the
time) over the null model (i.e. the children were choosing the
high-ranked 50% of the time) to be 24.93, which is
considered to be strong evidence (Kass & Raftery, 1995).

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 was conducted to rule out five alternative
explanations as to why children might prefer the puppet who
successfully crossed the stage: (1) Children might prefer the
puppet that reached its goal (in this case, crossing the stage)
over the one that failed to reach its goal; (2) Children might
prefer the puppet that remained visible the whole time (in
Exp. 1, the low-ranked puppet was occluded when the high-

243

ranked puppet passed in
front of it); (3) Children
might prefer the puppet
that moved last; (4)
Children might prefer the
puppet that moved farther
(i.e., traveled a longer
distance); (5) Children
might prefer the puppet
that moved in the same
way during the hierarchydisplay sequence as it did
during the familiarization
sequence (crossing the
stage instead of stopping
in the middle). Experiment
2 replicated the features of
Experiment 1, but without
any social interaction (and
therefore no show of
relative
social
rank)
between the puppets. The
procedure was the same as
Experiment 1 except for
the following changes:
Figure 2: Puppet Show
During the familiarization
used in Experiment 2
sequence, the puppets
again both crossed the
stage twice, but this time they moved in the same direction.
During the control-display sequence, the two puppets
appeared on the same side of the stage. One puppet moved
across the stage to the center, paused and bowed down
(replicating the motion of the low-ranked puppet in
Experiment 1). Then the other puppet crossed the stage,
passing in front of the bowing puppet. The ‘meet and retreat’
sequence in Experiment 1 was taken out in Experiment 2.
This sequence was repeated three times (See Figure 2).

Hispanic (n=1); White, Hispanic (n=1). 2 participants
declined to answer the race/ethnicity question.
Materials & Procedure: The puppets and stage were
identical to those in Study 1. Procedures were the same as in
Experiment 1 except for the following: During the
familiarization sequence of the puppet show, both puppets
moved across the stage in the same direction. During the
Control-Display Sequence (analogous to the HierarchyDisplay Sequence in Experiment 1), the two puppets
appeared on the same side of the stage. One puppet moved
across the stage to the center, then bowed down and moved
aside (replicating the motion of the low-ranked puppet in
Experiment 1). Then the second puppet crossed the stage,
passing in front of the bowing puppet. (See Figure 2)

Results and Discussion
Of the 21 children who contributed data to the analysis, 11
chose the puppet that completed its journey across the stage.
To compare the observed distribution (i.e. 11/21) to an
expected distribution (i.e. expected if the children chose the
complete-crossing puppet 50% of the time), we utilized
‘binom.test’ in the statistical program ‘R’ (p=1, estimated
probability of success = .524). We also used a Bayes Factor
Binomial calculator (http://pcl.missouri.edu/bf-binomial)
and found that odds of the null model (i.e. the odds that
children were choosing the high-ranked 50% of the time)
over the alternative model (that the children were choosing
the high-ranked either more or less than 50% of the time)
were 3.868, which is considered to be moderate evidence in
favor of the null (Kass & Raftery, 1995).

General Discussion
Taken together, the results of these two experiments
suggest that by 21 months, infants prefer novel high-ranking
individuals. Results from Experiment 2 suggest that the
children’s choice of the dominant puppet in Experiment 1
could not be attributed to a preference for the puppet that
accomplished its goal of crossing the stage, the puppet that
remained visible throughout, the puppet that moved last or
moved farther, or for the puppet that moved in the same way
in the hierarchy-display sequence as it had during the
familiarization sequence (i.e. remaining upright the whole
time). When children saw a puppet show that maintained all
of these features, but lacked the social interaction, which
established the relative ranks of each puppet in Experiment 1,
the preference for the puppet reaching its goal, disappeared.
This suggests that the preference for the dominant puppet in
Experiment 1 hinged on the fact that they directly interacted.
Taken together, this suggests that detecting relative
rank does not only allow children to ‘size up the competition’
and avoid conflicts with dominant individuals. If this were
the case, we would expect children to either avoid the highranking puppet, or to show no preference (if the children did
not expect to have a conflict with the puppets).

Methods
Participants
Participants were recruited from the same children’s museum
using the same procedure as in Experiment 1. A total of 34
children participated in the experiment. Of these, 13 were
excluded from the analysis for the following reasons:
Choosing both puppets (n=7); Refusing to choose a puppet
(n=3); Extreme fussiness (n=2); Experimenter error (the
puppets were moved backward in the puppet show, n=1). The
remaining 21 children (7 girls, 14 boys) contributed data to
the analysis. Their age ranged from 21-31 months (M=26.24
months; SD=3.28 days). Parents were given the same
demographic questionnaire as in Experiment 1. Responses to
the race/ethnicity questions included the following: White,
Not Hispanic (n=7); Asian, Not Hispanic (n=4); White,
Mexican American (n=3); Asian and White, Not Hispanic
(n=2); American Indian/ Alaska Native and Asian, Not
Hispanic (n=1); Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Not

244

There are at least two possible explanations for this
preference. The first is that children may seek to affiliate with
individuals who have more power and access to resources. In
other words, humans may share the tendency previously
shown in macaques (Silk, 1999) to seek alliances with higherranked individuals.
Another possible explanation for the preference, is
that children may expect high-ranking individuals to act as
leaders in what anthropologist Alan Fiske has called
Authority Ranking relationships (Fiske & Haslam, 2005;
Fiske & Rai, 2014; Fiske, 1992). Leaders in these types of
relationships are motivated to guide and protect subordinates;
who in turn are motivated to defer to leaders (and to punish
other low-ranking individuals who don’t defer). According to
Fiske, subordinates expect leaders to provide this protection
and guidance. Support for this view comes from a large body
of ethnographic research that suggests human social
hierarchy is often expressed through these mutually
beneficial relationships between high- and low-ranked
individuals.
When considering these results, a few points should
be kept in mind. First, the puppets in the current experiment
were much smaller than the children reaching for them. It is
possible that children might avoid a dominant puppet if the
puppets were as big as the children themselves, and further
studies will investigate this possibility.
It is also worth noting that the children who
participated in this study have likely had many positive
experiences with high-ranking individuals such as parents,
older siblings and other caregivers. Generalizing from these
experiences, children may view higher-ranked individuals in
a positive light, expecting them to provide protection and
guidance. Further research could also explore whether
children who have experienced abuse or neglect show the
same preference, although such research presents many
practical challenges. It is also worth noting that younger
infants might not share this preference who have had less
experience with high-ranking individuals. It could be that the
‘default’ preference is to avoid high-ranking individuals, but
that through experience children form positive associations
with them. Future studies will explore this possibility.
Finally, children (like adults) are complicated
creatures, who can be fascinated by things that also scare
them a little. Further studies are needed to establish whether
children’s preference for the ‘dominant’ puppet in the present
study reflects unambiguously positive feelings (e.g., the
expectation of guidance and protection), or some mixture of
positive and negative (e.g., curiosity and fear).
In any case, it is interesting to compare the
preference for high-ranking puppets shown in the present
study to the established finding that infants prefer helpers
over hinderers (Hamlin et al., 2007, 2011). In our study, one
puppet bowed and moved aside which, while not actively
helping, at least allowed the other puppet to reach its goal.
(And by the same token, the non-bowing puppet could be

seen as preventing or hindering the other from reaching its
goal.) The findings by Hamlin et al. would seem to suggest
that if children had looked at the scene primarily in terms of
helping and hindering, they should have preferred the puppet
who bowed (i.e. the helper). The fact that children actually
showed a strong preference for the puppet who did not bow
suggests that children did not view this social interaction
primarily as a helping/hindering event. This may be because
children view active helping (i.e., pushing another puppet up
a hill, or opening a box for him) differently from passive
helping (i.e., moving out of the way). Or it may be that social
rank takes precedence over prosocial behavior. That is,
children at this age may care more about affiliating with highranking individuals than with helpful ones.
The null result we found in Experiment 2 provides
another point of contact with the broader literature. At least
one study has shown that toddlers prefer competent
individuals over non-competent individuals (Jara-Ettinger,
Tenenbaum, & Schulz, 2015; see also Pasquini, Corriveau,
Koenig, & Harris, 2007). This raises the question of why
children did only preferred the puppet that crossed the stage
in Experiment 1. One possibility is that in Experiment 2,
where there was no meet-and-retreat sequence, and one
puppet stopped halfway across the stage, children thought the
puppet stopped of its own volition. Another possibility is that
the two studies operationalized ‘competence’ differently
enough to affect children’s preferences. In the study by JaraEttinger et al., the puppets’ goal was to play music. Children
may have cared more about this goal than about seeing a
puppet cross a stage in the present experiment. (That is,
toddlers may only pay attention to competencies they care
about, or may only prefer those individuals who are
competent at doing something the toddler wants done.) In
contrast, our experiment used the sparse goal of simply
crossing the stage, which children presumably have no
experience with. This makes it all the more striking that they
preferred the high-ranking puppet in Experiment 1, since the
puppets goal was both novel and irrelevant.
Future studies will investigate the effects that social
rank, competence and prosocial behavior have on children’s
evaluations of individuals. For now, the present study
demonstrates that very young children are not only sensitive
to the relative social status of novel agents; but that they also
prefer dominant ones.
