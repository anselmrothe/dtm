Design and Procedure
The design of the study was 2 × 2 (visual/epistemic × s-
consistent/s-inconsistent). The visual/epistemic variable
refers to the direct object (visual vs. abstract) of the critical
verb.      S-consistent/s-inconsistent       refers    to     the
‘consistency/inconsistency with spatial (directional and
proximity) implications from literal/visual use of see’ and

sentence. Separate repeated-measures ANOVAs (with
follow-up t-tests) were run on see/aware and see/think of
