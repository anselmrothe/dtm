Participants were presented with three blocks of comparison
trials. Each block was composed wholly of trials of a
particular stimulus type. Presentation order of circle and line
blocks were counterbalanced across participants, and dot
block was always presented last. Participants first saw
instructions, then received eight practice trials, and then
performed the formal experimental trials. Accuracy
feedback was provided for practice trials but not for test
trials. Each participant completed all tasks in one hour-long
session.
   Participants were instructed to press the space bar to
initiate each trial. Each trial began with a fixation cross
presented in the center of the screen for 500 ms,
immediately followed by an 800 ms presentation of the
reference ratio stimulus (various instantiations of ½). The                   Figure 3. A sample line ratio comparison trial.

                            Results
Prior to analysis, we first excluded trials with reaction times
below 250 ms or that were more than 3 standard deviations
faster or slower than a participant’s mean reaction time for
that task. Nine participants were excluded from the analyses
because of very low accuracy (below 60%) in the
experimental task. For remaining participants (n=28),
average accuracy across three tasks was: 87.31% (circle
ratios), 88.70% (line ratios), and 85.58% (dot ratios). Only
RTs for accurate responses were used for SNARC analyses,
   To test for the presence of the SNARC effect, mean
reaction times for correct responses made with the left hand         Figure 4: dRT as a function of fraction magnitudes for circle

each fraction magnitude across all participants. This
measure, dRT, is positive when a participant responds faster
with the left hand for a particular stimulus and negative if
the participant responds faster with the right hand. A
classical SNARC effect is noted when dRTs are more
positive for small numbers and more negative for large
numbers, yielding a negative slope when dRT is regressed
against stimulus magnitude. However, it is often the case
that dRTs for small numbers are not actually positively
valued (e.g., Dehaene et al., 1993; Fias, Brysbaert, Geypens,
& d’Ydewalle, 1996) because intercept is confounded with
handedness effects (i.e., right hand responses are typically
faster in right handed participants). Thus, slope is generally
taken as the key measure of the SNARC effect.
   We ran an omnibus regression on mean dRTs for against
ratio magnitudes, including stimulus type and stimulus type               Figure 5: dRT as a function of fraction magnitudes for

as the baseline, with dummy codes for circle and dot
stimuli). There was a significant regression slope based on
magnitude b = -66.57, p = .03. However, there was no
significant main effect for stimulus type, nor was there a
significant type X magnitude interaction. This indicates that
the SNARC effect for all three types of stimuli were
statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that the effects on
dRT really did correspond to the ratio magnitudes presented
independently of format.
   For ease of presentation, we depict the results of separate
regressions for each format in Figures 4, 5, & 6. The slopes
for each was significant (bcircles = -59.84, p = .02; blines =
-66.57, p = 0.04; bdots = -68.33, p = 0.04). These figures
