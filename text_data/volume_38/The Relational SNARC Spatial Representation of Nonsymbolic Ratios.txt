Abstract
Recent research has highlighted the operation of a ratio
processing system that represents the analog magnitudes of
nonsymbolic ratios. This study investigated whether such
representations would demonstrate spatial associations
parallel to the SNARC (spatial numeric association of
response codes) effect previously demonstrated with whole
number
magnitudes.
Participants
judged
whether
nonsymbolic ratio test stimuli were larger or smaller than
reference stimuli using response keys located alternately
either on the left or on the right side of space. Larger ratio
magnitudes were associated with the right side of space and
smaller magnitudes with the left. These results demonstrate
that nonsymbolic ratio magnitudes – defined relationally by
pairs of components – are characterized by a left-to-right
spatial mapping. The current focus on ratio magnitudes
expands our understanding of the basic human perceptual
apparatus and how it might provide tools that grant intuitive
access to more advanced numerical concepts beyond whole
numbers.

Introduction
Recent years have brought increased attention to human
abilities to process the magnitudes of numerical fractions
(Bailey, Hoard, Nugent, & Geary, 2012; Kallai & Tzelgov,
2009; Siegler et al., 2012). Although understanding this
ability has practical importance and may inform the design
principles for promoting school learning, there are
compelling reasons to investigate the basic science behind
processing fraction magnitudes as well. In particular,
learning more about the representation of fraction
magnitudes has implications for our understanding of how
humans gain access to numerical concepts. Moreover, this
line of research may provide insight into the ways humans
perceive magnitudes more generally.

Much work on the psychophysics of numerical perception
focuses on the ways we process whole numbers and their
nonsymbolic analogs, such as the number of dots in an array
or the magnitudes of whole number symbols (e.g.,
Kaufman, Lord, Reese, & Volkmann, 1949; Moyer &
Landauer, 1967; Stevens, 1957). Indeed, seminal works
have demonstrated deep parallels between the ways humans
perceive the magnitudes of whole number values and their
analogs in nonsymbolic numerosities. Perhaps most notable
among these findings was Moyer and Landauer’s (1967)
discovery that, when participants were asked to compare
numerals, they first converted numerals to analog
magnitudes and compared them “in much the same way that
comparisons are made between physical stimuli such as
loudness or length of line.” (p. 1520). Many have taken
these parallels to suggest that the ability to process
nonsymbolic numerosities may be a key foundational ability
that helps ground whole number concepts (e.g., Feigenson,
Dehaene, & Spelke, 2004; Nieder & Dehaene, 2009; Piazza,
2010).
Several recent studies began to suggest that humans are
also capable of processing the nonsymbolic analogs of
fractions values (Chesney & Matthews, 2013; Jacob,
Vallentin, & Nieder, 2012; Matthews, Lewis, & Hubbard,
2015). These studies extend the psychophysics of perception
to the study of nonsymbolically instantiated ratio
magnitudes. What is interesting about these magnitudes is
that they do not correspond to individual stimuli like a
single dot array or a single line segment; instead, they are
compound stimuli whose magnitudes are determined
relationally. For instance, in Figure 1, panel (a) represents
the same ratio as panel (b), despite the fact that each of its
components is larger than those of ratio (b). Similarly, it is a
smaller ratio than that in panel (c), despite the fact that its
components are larger when considered individually.
Focusing on the perception of nonsymbolic ratio
magnitudes stands to expand our understanding of our basic
perceptual apparatus and how it might provide tools that

grant intuitive access to more advanced numerical concepts
beyond whole numbers.
To date, studies have suggested that the nonsymbolic ratio
processing is operative among nonhuman primates (Jacob et
al., 2012), human infants (McCrink & Wynn, 2007),
elementary school age children (Boyer, Levine, &
Huttenlocher, 2008), typically developing adults (Chesney
& Matthews, 2013), and individuals with limited number
vocabularies and formal arithmetic skills (McCrink, Spelke,
Dehaene, & Pica, 2013). Moreover, the ability correlates
with symbolic math abilities in ways that are distinct from
the approximate number system or ANS (Matthews et al.,
2015, see also Hansen et al., 2015). Despite the above
evidence demonstrating that humans can process
nonsymbolic ratio magnitudes, much remains unknown
about the nature these abilities.
In order to better understand whether non-symbolic ratios
– these visuospatial fraction analogs – are processed
similarly to whole number magnitudes, we tested whether
they elicited spatial mappings. Many have argued for the
association of number and space (e.g., Hubbard, Piazza,
Pinel, & Dehaene, 2005; Newcombe, Levine, & Mix, 2015),
with research on the SNARC (spatial numeric association of
response codes) effect as the most well-known example
(Dehaene, Bossini, & Giraux, 1993). The SNARC effect –
an association between left responses and small numerical
quantities and between right responses and large numerical
quantities – is considered to be an indication that numbers
are represented on a mental number line, spatially oriented
from left to right with increasing magnitude (Dehaene et al.,
1993). Indeed, in an oft-cited piece, Walsh (2003) predicted
that the SNARC effect is only a special case of a SQUARC
(spatial quantity of response codes) whereby all quantities
represented in analog form are mapped to space.
Whether the analog perception of nonsymbolic ratios is
cast in terms of number specifically or in terms of
magnitude more generally, we hypothesize that such
magnitudes should be associated with space, resulting in a
SNARC or SQUARC effect. For convenience sake, we will
simply refer to any such findings with the current stimuli as
a SNARC effect. With the present study, we sought to elicit
the SNARC using novel ratio stimuli.

All stimuli were presented on 22” monitors using the
MATLAB Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (PTB-3)
(Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2007). We
constructed three different types of nonsymbolic ratio
comparison tasks: nonsymbolic circle ratios, nonsymbolic
line ratios, and nonsymbolic dot ratios (see Figure 2 for
sample ratio formats). In each, participants were asked to
decide whether a test ratio was larger or smaller than a
reference ratio. For some symbolic SNARC tasks (e.g.,
Dehaene, Dupoux & Mehler, 1990; Gevers, Verguts,
Reynvoet, Caessens & Fias, 2006; Santens & Gevers, 2008),
stimuli are compared to a memorized standard located
halfway between the extremes of the stimulus set. However,
there is no nonsymbolic standard that could be referenced in
memory without a label to serve as a perfect analog for this
task. Thus, we used a nonsymbolic standard presented
before each test stimulus in place of a memorized standard
in the current paradigm. The set of test stimuli were used to
instantiate magnitudes corresponding to the 26 irreducible,
single-digit proper fraction values except ½, which was at
the midpoint of the stimulus range and was reserved as the
reference value for comparison (drawn from the symbolic
fractions list used in Toomarian and Hubbard, under
review). Because the stimuli were nonsymbolic, the
“irreducible” and “single-digit” qualifiers do not strictly
apply in the current case. The sizes of the ratio components
used to instantiate those values varied from trial to trial, and
participants were asked to focus on the overall ratio each
time. The reference ratio was fixed to ½, and the sizes of the
components used to instantiate it also varied from trial to
trial. We randomly varied components as a control to reduce
reliance on the magnitudes of individual components and
possible pattern-recognition strategies. These tasks assessed
the ability to discriminate between nonsymbolic ratio values
composed of circle areas, line segments, or dot arrays.
Circle Ratios Each stimulus was composed of a pair of
circles, with one serving as a figurative ‘numerator’ and
another as the ‘denominator’. Numerator circles were white
and denominator circles were black, both presented on a
gray background, similar to the stimuli used by Matthews et
al. (2015). Ratio size was defined as the area of the white
circle up top to the area of the black circle on bottom. The
summed areas of the numerator circle and the denominator
circle were constrained such that it occupied between 2040% of an invisible rectangle of 600 pixels high and 300
pixels wide.

2652

Line Ratios Each stimulus was composed of a pair of lines.
Shorter white lines served as numerators, and longer black
lines served as denominators for all stimuli. They were both
presented on a gray background. The distance between two
lines was 50 pixels, and the width of both lines was 20
pixels. The summed lengths of the numerator and
denominator lines were constrained such that they occupied
30 – 60% of the height of a 600 x 300 pixel frame.
Additionally, the vertical position of the shorter line varied
randomly.

reference stimulus was followed by another fixation cross
for 500 ms, followed by the test ratio stimulus which
remained on screen until participants submitted a response
or timed out at 3000 ms (see Figure 3).
After viewing both the reference and the test ratios,
participants were asked to decide if the second ratio was
larger or smaller than the first, which was always equal to
½. Participants made decisions via button press on a
standard keyboard (19 mm horizontal center-to-center
distance), with either the left (“D” key) or right (“K” key)
buttons indicating that the second ratio was larger. Response
side was counterbalanced both within blocks of
corresponding stimuli and across participants, meaning that
half of the participants pressed “K” for larger with right
hand and “D” for smaller with left hand first, while the other
half participants pressed “D” for larger with left hand and
“K” for smaller with right hand first. Each ratio value
appeared eight times for circle and line stimuli, but appeared
only four times for dot stimuli. There were 208 total trials
for each circle and line stimuli type, and 104 trials for dot
stimuli type, resulting a total of 520 trials.
Note that our primary interest was in finding the SNARC
for ratios instantiated by continuous quantities (circles and
lines) because – unlike dot arrays – individual circles and
lines do not map to any particular number. We therefore felt
that ratios of continuous nonsymbolic quantities provided a
more stringent test for ratio processing than dots. Given
time constraints for each experimental session, we only
conducted a relatively impoverished test of the dot
comparison condition: dot comparisons always came last,
and stimuli were only seen half as often as the line and
circle stimuli.
For line stimuli, participants were told to estimate “the
ratios between line lengths.” For circle stimuli, participants
were specifically told to estimate “the ratios between circle
areas, or how much room each circle takes up on the
screen.” They were also told stimuli would flash too briefly
to measure or to use calculations, so they should “just try to
feel out the ratio instead of applying a formula.” These
instructions parallel protocols we have used elsewhere
(Chesney & Matthews, 2013; Matthews et al., 2015), and
participants quickly understood the tasks.

Dot Ratios Each stimulus was composed of a pair of dot
arrays arranged to form a nonsymbolic ratio. The
numerators of the nonsymbolic numerosity arrays were
composed of black dots on a white background, and the
denominators were composed of white dots on a black
background. Both were presented in a 600 x 300 pixel frame
on a gray background. Individual dot size varied between 8
and 12 pixels in diameter. To discourage participants from
counting or using computational procedures to estimate the
ratios, the summed numerosity of numerator dots and
denominator dots fluctuated from 150 to 200. The smallest
numerosity displayed in any given array was 15. Dots were
randomly and evenly distributed in each array.

represent fraction magnitude of 1/3.

Procedure
Participants were presented with three blocks of comparison
trials. Each block was composed wholly of trials of a
particular stimulus type. Presentation order of circle and line
blocks were counterbalanced across participants, and dot
block was always presented last. Participants first saw
instructions, then received eight practice trials, and then
performed the formal experimental trials. Accuracy
feedback was provided for practice trials but not for test
trials. Each participant completed all tasks in one hour-long
session.
Participants were instructed to press the space bar to
initiate each trial. Each trial began with a fixation cross
presented in the center of the screen for 500 ms,
immediately followed by an 800 ms presentation of the
reference ratio stimulus (various instantiations of ½). The

Results
Prior to analysis, we first excluded trials with reaction times
below 250 ms or that were more than 3 standard deviations
faster or slower than a participant’s mean reaction time for
that task. Nine participants were excluded from the analyses
because of very low accuracy (below 60%) in the
experimental task. For remaining participants (n=28),
average accuracy across three tasks was: 87.31% (circle
ratios), 88.70% (line ratios), and 85.58% (dot ratios). Only
RTs for accurate responses were used for SNARC analyses,
To test for the presence of the SNARC effect, mean
reaction times for correct responses made with the left hand
were subtracted from right hand mean reaction times for
each fraction magnitude across all participants. This
measure, dRT, is positive when a participant responds faster
with the left hand for a particular stimulus and negative if
the participant responds faster with the right hand. A
classical SNARC effect is noted when dRTs are more
positive for small numbers and more negative for large
numbers, yielding a negative slope when dRT is regressed
against stimulus magnitude. However, it is often the case
that dRTs for small numbers are not actually positively
valued (e.g., Dehaene et al., 1993; Fias, Brysbaert, Geypens,
& d’Ydewalle, 1996) because intercept is confounded with
handedness effects (i.e., right hand responses are typically
faster in right handed participants). Thus, slope is generally
taken as the key measure of the SNARC effect.
We ran an omnibus regression on mean dRTs for against
ratio magnitudes, including stimulus type and stimulus type
X magnitude interactions in the model (line stimuli served
as the baseline, with dummy codes for circle and dot
stimuli). There was a significant regression slope based on
magnitude b = -66.57, p = .03. However, there was no
significant main effect for stimulus type, nor was there a
significant type X magnitude interaction. This indicates that
the SNARC effect for all three types of stimuli were
statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that the effects on
dRT really did correspond to the ratio magnitudes presented
independently of format.
For ease of presentation, we depict the results of separate
regressions for each format in Figures 4, 5, & 6. The slopes
for each was significant (bcircles = -59.84, p = .02; blines =
-66.57, p = 0.04; bdots = -68.33, p = 0.04). These figures
illustrate that all three types of nonsymbolic ratio stimuli
elicited robust spatial associations – classical SNARC
effects.

Discussion
The current experiments demonstrated the existence of
spatial associations with magnitudes instantiated using three
different types of nonsymbolic ratios (i.e., dot arrays, line
pairs, and circle pairs). These effects paralleled the classical
SNARC, but differed in two important ways: First, the
stimuli were nonsymbolic, instead of symbolic. Second, the
stimuli were ratios, so the magnitudes were defined

relationally as opposed to corresponding to the absolute
magnitude of any individual component. Several aspects of
the current experiment make important contributions to our
understanding of human magnitude processing.
First, the current study provides further evidence for the
existence of a ratio processing system and extends our
understanding of its operation. Participants performed
accurately on a perceptually based task comparing ratio

2654

magnitudes, replicating recent work demonstrating human
sensitivity to nonsymbolic ratio magnitudes (e.g., Jacob et
al., 2012; Matthews & Chesney, 2015; Matthews et al.,
2015; McCrink et al., 2013; Meert, Grégoire, Seron, &
Noël, 2012).
This in itself represents a contribution to the basic science
of human magnitude representation. The nonsymbolic
aspects of the current experiment stand alongside other
research demonstrating that the basic operation of the
SNARC effect applies to nonsymbolic magnitudes. For
instance, Holmes & Lourenco (2011) found similar spatial
associations using the valence of facial expressions of
emotion, and Rusconi, Kwan, Giordano, Umiltà, and
Butterworth (2006) demonstrated spatial associations with
musical pitch. All together these works seem consistent with
speculation that the SNARC effect may be a more general
association between quantities and space – a SQUARC.
Here we underscore the fact that the use of ratio
magnitudes in this study represents a major departure from
previous studies involving automatic associations of space
and magnitude (be they symbolic or nonsymbolic). Previous
SNARC/SQUARC studies have involved quantities with
stand-alone magnitudes: the size of a number (Dehaene et
al., 1993), the angriness of an expression (Holmes &
Lourenco, 2011), or the “height” of a musical pitch
(Rusconi et al., 2006). In the present case, the magnitudes
involved emerged from the relations between two
components, each of which had its own magnitude. That is,
even though each circle in a ratio stimulus had its own
magnitude, the effects found here reflected a magnitude
determined by the relation between the two – one that can
be expressed by multiple components of different sizes so
long as the pairs maintain the same ratio value. The current
findings suggest that this emergent relational magnitude is
automatically mapped to space as well.
These results may also have implications for how we
think about the human number sense from an applied
perspective. Unlike research involving faces and musical
pitch, the ratio stimuli used in the current experiments are
fraction analogs. Each is a concrete instantiation of a
fraction value, and prior work has shown that human adults
can make the mapping between these nonsymbolic stimuli
and symbolic numbers (Matthews & Chesney, 2015).
Moreover, Matthews et al. (2015) have shown that college
student’s ability to compare nonsymbolic ratios predicts
symbolic fraction and algebra skills. Thus, Lewis et al.
(2015) have essentially argued that nonsymbolic ratios are
protonumerical and that ratio processing abilities may be an
early-emerging tool that provides intuitive access to
fractions concepts. The existence of a SNARC for these
fraction analogs adds to the potential of this speculative
account.
In summary, the current study contributes another
advancement in a recent string of studies shedding light on
the impressive extent of human ratio processing abilities
(Boyer & Levine, 2012; Jacob et al., 2012; Matthews &
Chesney, 2015; Matthews et al., 2015; McCrink & Wynn,

2007; Möhring, Newcombe, Levine, & Frick, 2015). Each
step foregrounding the perception of ratio magnitudes
expands our understanding of the basic human perceptual
apparatus. This in turn informs theory about the
foundational inputs upon which concepts can be built.
