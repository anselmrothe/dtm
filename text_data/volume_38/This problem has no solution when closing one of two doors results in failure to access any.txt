hypothesized that participants would have a better rate of
success on solvable problems with ordinal quantities
compared to solvable problems with cardinal quantities,
because participants whose first spontaneous representation
was associated with a 3-step strategy would fail to switch to
a representation of the problem associated with the 1-step
strategy.
   Our second hypothesis regarded the situations in which
participants overcame the difficulty related to an
incongruent representation and managed to find the correct
solution of a cardinal problem. We hypothesized that higher
response times would be recorded on successfully solved
cardinal problems compared to successfully solved ordinal
problems.                                                          Figure 4: Mean response time on correctly solved problems.

recoding step was a costly one.
   In order to better understand these processes, in a second
experiment, we explicitly gave the answer to the
participants, and asked them to evaluate its validity. The
goal was to go beyond the first experiment by evaluating
whether the difficulty lied in the ability to discover the
solution, or in the capacity to recognize it as a valid one.
We made the hypothesis that, even when presented with the
complete solution, participants would tend to refuse it more
often if the representation they inferred from the problem
was semantically incongruent with the solution. They would

Procedure
The only aspect in which this experiment differed from the
previous one was the nature of the task proposed to the
participants. Instead of telling them to solve the problems
themselves, we proposed a potential solution for each
problem, and asked them to identify whether the solution
was a valid one, or whether the problem could not be
solved. For every problem, the question “Given the data
provided, is it possible to find the solution?” was displayed,
and below two choices were available: “No, we do not have
enough information to solve this problem.” and “Yes:
