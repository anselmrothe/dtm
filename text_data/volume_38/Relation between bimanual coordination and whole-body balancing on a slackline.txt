number of possible shared locations in phase space. It
provides an index of the magnitude of stochastic noise in the
system (Pellecchia et al., 2005); a higher %REC indicates
less noise in the system. The other measure was related to
the line structure calculated from the recurrence plot,
Maxline (MAXL). MAXL is the longest shared trajectory in
phase space and the length of the maximum diagonal line on
the plot (Webber & Zbilut, 2005). MAXL is a measure of
the stability of the shared activity (Shockley, 2005). It is
supposed to provide an index of the system’s sensitivity to
perturbations (i.e., the strength of the attractor against
perturbations) (Pellecchia et al., 2005).
   We performed CRQA using the R package “crqa”
(version 1.0.6) (Coco & Dale, 2014) after determining the
optimal values for the input parameters (e.g., time delay,
embedding dimensions, radius) with reference to the
standard guidelines of the RQA method (Webber & Zbilut,
2005).Consequently, we chose parameters of 20 for time
delay, 3 for embedding dimensions, and 25 for radius (with
z-score normalization and maximum distance rescaling;
Webber & Zbilut, 2005).                                          Figure 3 Sample 20 sec. time series of both hands for the
