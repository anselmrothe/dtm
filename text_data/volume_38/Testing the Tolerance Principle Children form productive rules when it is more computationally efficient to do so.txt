aloud (or type it into a response box on Mechanical Turk)
before moving on to the next trial. Every 18 trials they were
given a short break. Children were offered a sticker during
breaks to encourage them to continue in the experiment.
Production Test After exposure, we used a “wug” test to
assess whether children had formed a productive rule

                   Results & Analysis
For each production test trial, participants were asked to
produce the plural form of a novel noun they heard only in a
singular form. These novel productions allowed us to assess
whether participants formed a productive rule. Recall that
the Tolerance Principle predicts that there will be a
