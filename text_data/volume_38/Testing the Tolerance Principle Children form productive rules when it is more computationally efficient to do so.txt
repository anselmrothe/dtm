Abstract
During language acquisition, children must learn when to
generalize a pattern – applying it broadly and to new words
(‘add –ed’ in English) – and when to restrict generalization,
storing the pattern only with specific lexical items. One effort
to quantify the conditions for generalization, the Tolerance
Principle, has been shown to accurately predict children’s
generalizations in dozens of corpus-based studies. This
principle hypothesizes that a general rule will be formed
when it is computationally more efficient than storing lexical
forms individually. It is formalized as: a rule R will generalize
if the number of exceptions does not exceed the number of
words in the category N divided by the natural log of N
(N/lnN). Here we test the principle in an artificial language of
9 nonsense nouns. As predicted, children exposed to 5 regular
forms and 4 exceptions generalized, applying the regular form
to 100% of novel test words. Children exposed to 3 regular
forms and 6 exceptions did not extend the rule, even though
the token frequency of the regular form was still high in this
condition. The Tolerance Principle thus appears to capture a
basic principle of generalization in rule formation.

Introduction
When children learn a language, they do not just memorize
words or sentences; they acquire the patterns by which
words and sentences are formed. We call these rules – for
example, “add –ed” for the past tense of a verb or “add –s”
to make a noun plural. However, in some cases there are not
broad patterns for how words change their form; sometimes
there are many idiosyncratic ways in which individual
words form the plural or the past tense, such as mouse / mice
or go / went – and these must indeed be memorized.
Several types of evidence show that children acquire rules
when they are available. For example, young children make
overgeneralization errors, extending rules to words that are
actually lexical exceptions (e.g. daddy goed to the store; I
saw two mouses yesterday) (Marcus et al. 1992, Pinker
1992, 1995, Yang 2002, Maslen et al. 2004). Furthermore,
when children are asked to produce novel lexical forms in
controlled experiments, they can spontaneously apply these
rules to nonsense words they have never heard before
(Berko 1958). In the famous ‘wug’ test, children were
exposed to novel items from various linguistic categories

and were asked to provide their inflected forms. (For
example, This is a wug. Now there are two of them. There
are two ___.) Children demonstrated that they had acquired
productive rules by applying regular inflections (e.g. wugs)
in these novel cases (Berko 1958).
However, not all linguistic rules are productive. Some
inflected forms are idiosyncratic to a single lexical item, as
noted above. In addition, some rules apply to only a
restricted subset of lexical items, like sing/sang/sung and
ring/rang/rung, but are not productive in that they do not
apply broadly to new words. Children presented with novel
forms like gling (similar to irregulars like ring and sing) do
not produce glang as the past-test form (Berko, 1958).
Though there are a handful of examples of irregular rules
being generalized during language acquisition (e.g. wipewope, think-thunk) (Pinker 1999), this type of overirregularization is unattested in the CHILDES corpus (Yang
2015). In other data, over-regularization errors involving -ed
are relatively common (about 8%; Maslen et al. 2004),
whereas analogical errors following irregular patterns are
exceedingly rare (no more than 0.2%; Xu & Pinker 1995).
Importantly, this absence of over-irregularization is not
exclusive to English acquisition; it has been documented in
children’s naturalistic production data in many other
languages (see e.g. Clahsen and Penke 1992 on German,
Allen 1996 on Inuktitut, Clahsen et al. 2004 on Spanish,
Caprin and Guasti 2009 on Italian, Demuth 2003 on Bantu
languages, Deen 2005 on Swahili, among others).
The tendency to generalize some rules but to restrict
others motivates the question: what governs when children
will form productive rules during language acquisition?
Researchers have been investigating rule learning in
language acquisition for many years, but most work has
focused on the difference between learning rules and
learning the exceptions (not on the difference between
learning regular and irregular rules). Though it is generally
agreed that learners must memorize the idiosyncratic
exceptions (e.g., go-went), how regular and irregular rules
are handled is still debated. Some have proposed that the
irregular rules must be memorized in the same way that the
exceptions are (Pinker and Ullman 2002). Others have
proposed that everything must be memorized, including
both the regular and irregular rules (McClelland and

2321

Patterson 2002). While this argument is not resolved, the
available behavioral evidence, most clearly from children’s
production, points to a strong distinction between rules that
are productive and those that are not. There must therefore
be a mechanism during learning that governs when
productive rules will be formed.
Recently Yang has proposed the Tolerance Principle
(2005, 2016) – a model of productivity based on the
acquisition literature that takes this categorical distinction
into account. It quantifies the precise number of exceptions
that a productive rule can tolerate before it becomes
computationally less efficient than storing all of the lexical
items individually. The Tolerance Principle accurately
predicts children’s generalizations in corpus data from
dozens of rules/patterns in a number of languages,
demonstrating that it is a viable model of productivity in
language acquisition. However, in order to have adequate
data for predictions, corpus analyses combine data from
multiple children at different ages, not all of whom may
show the same behaviors; and one can only test those
patterns that happen to occur in real languages. Here we ask
whether the Tolerance Principle can predict when children
will generalize a productive rule in an artificial language
learning experiment, where we can manipulate the precise
number of lexical items that obey a rule or are exceptions.
Our results indicate that children do indeed form a
productive rule when the Tolerance Principle predicts that
they will, applying the regular form to 100% of novel test
words. When the Tolerance Principle predicts that no
productive rule should be formed, children do not extend the
rule, even though the token frequency of the most regular
form was still high in this condition. In contrast, adult
participants learning the same artificial language appear to
extend the rule at the same level as the rule’s token
frequency in the language, approximating a well-studied
phenomenon known as probability matching (Hudson Kam
& Newport, 2005, 2009). We present this as evidence that
the Tolerance Principle appears to capture a basic principle
of generalization in rule formation in children, and suggest
that adults adopt a different strategy during rule learning.

The Tolerance Principle
The Tolerance Principle (Yang, 2005, 2016) is a learning
model that quantifies the precise conditions for
generalization during language acquisition. It hypothesizes
that a general rule will be formed when doing so is
computationally more efficient than storing lexical forms
individually. The model computes this computational
efficiency by calculating the time complexity of applying a
rule compared with accessing individual lexical forms. To
illustrate, imagine that a learner is faced with a potential rule
– for example, the English ‘add –ed to make a verb in the
past tense.’ The English learner has encountered many items
that obey this rule (regular forms) as well as many items that
do not (irregular forms or exceptions). To be maximally
efficient in formulating the past tense of verbs, the learner
can do one of two things:

(1) Store all lexical forms individually: store every
item individually in a list ranked by frequency,
searching the list every time there is an occasion to
express the past tense of a verb.
(2) Form a productive rule: store only the exceptions
in a frequency-ranked list. To express the past
tense, the learner searches the list of exceptions
first. If the target verb is not among these
exceptions, the learner applies the rule ‘add –ed.’
The Tolerance Principle computes the time complexity
required for each of these operations and assumes that the
learner will adopt the optimal (i.e., faster) strategy.
Productive rules, then, are formed only when it is more
computationally efficient for the learner.
Formally, if R is a rule that may apply to N lexical items
and there are e exceptions to this rule, the time required to
access the rule can be expressed as T(N, e). If R is
productive, as in (2) above, then the rule is not applied until
the learner has first evaluated and rejected every exception
(e) on the list. In other words, applying a productive rule
consumes e units of time. The time required for exceptions,
on the other hand, is determined by the lexical item’s
frequency (i.e., its rank in the list of exceptions). To
compute the time complexity T(N, e), Yang (2016:48)
calculates “the weighted average of time units over the
probabilities of these two sets of items.” If R is
unproductive, as in (1) above, then all N items are treated as
exceptions and are listed in order of frequency. The time
complexity under these circumstances can be expressed
T(N, N), as the number of exceptions e is equivalent to the
number of items in the list N. It is conjectured that the
learner compares the time complexity required to form a
productive rule, T(N, e), with the time complexity required
when all N items are stored individually as lexical
exceptions, T(N, N). By solving this equation for e, the
Tolerance Principle computes the precise number of
exceptions that a productive rule can tolerate before its
formation becomes computationally inefficient.1 This
solution is as follows:
(3) Tolerance Principle: Let R be a rule that is
applicable to N items, of which e are exceptions. R
is productive if and only if e ≤θN=N/ln(N).
In other words, it is only more efficient to form a productive
rule when the number of exceptions is less than the number
of items divided by the natural log of the number of items.
To illustrate, imagine a category of 9 items. Given a rule R
that may apply to these 9 items, the Tolerance Principle
predicts that 4.096 (or θ9=9/ln9) exceptions will be tolerated
before forming a productive rule becomes less efficient than
storing individual items. This means that learners will form
a productive rule if there are 4 or fewer exceptions to the
rule R, but not if there are 5 or more. Importantly, this
implies that the distinction between forming a productive
rule and storing individual lexical items is a categorical one.

Principle and the supporting psycholinguistic evidence from

There is a theoretical tipping point at which forming a
productive rule becomes less computationally efficient than
the alternative strategy. The Tolerance Principle allows us to
compute this tipping point.
How well does this model hold up to empirical
investigation? Yang has tested the model on corpus data in a
number of rule acquisition scenarios and found that the
Tolerance Principle predicts productive rule formation
surprisingly accurately. For example, consider the English
productive rule ‘add –ed to make a verb past tense.’ Yang
analyzed the 5 million words of child-directed English from
CHILDES (MacWhinney 2000) and found 1022 unique
past-tense verbs. By the Tolerance Principle, the English
‘add –ed’ rule should tolerate 147 verbs that are exceptions
in a class of 1022 lexical items. Yang’s analysis found only
127, well below the tipping point (θ1022=147) for
computational efficiency. The irregular rules/patterns in
English, however, do not fare so well. Even the irregular
class that has the highest homogeneity, the ing-ang class
(such as sing-sang and ring-rang), has too many exceptions.
The CHILDES English input corpus has 8 verbs that end in
ing, but only three change the past tense to ang (ring, sing,
spring) and five do not (bring, fling, sting, swing, wing),
exceeding the threshold of θ8=3. Thus the ing-ang pattern is
predicted to be unproductive, in accord with children’s
productions described in the Introduction.
Though Yang has provided substantial evidence from
corpus analyses to validate his account, further empirical
investigation is necessary to demonstrate that children
indeed follow the Tolerance Principle in acquiring
productive rules during language acquisition. Here we will
apply two well-known acquisition paradigms – artificial
language learning and the “wug” test – to submit the
Tolerance Principle to further experimental scrutiny. We use
an artificial language paradigm to precisely control the input
to child learners, providing them with highly controlled
frequencies and numbers of words that follow a rule and
words that are exceptions. This allows us to create
conditions where the Tolerance Principle predicts
productive rule formation (as in the –ed example above),
and where it predicts that a rule will be unproductive (as in
the ing-ang example above). We ask whether the Tolerance
Principle correctly predicts when a pattern in an artificial
language is widespread enough for a child to form a
productive rule, using a “wug” test to assess whether
children have formed a productive rule (one that applies to
novel lexical items) or have restricted generalization.

Behavioral Data

correct noun on at least 50% of the test trials). Children
were recruited from Washington DC metro area schools and
were run either at their school or in our lab. Adult
participants were recruited and run online using Amazon
Mechanical Turk2. All participants were native English
speakers with normal hearing and normal to corrected-tonormal vision. Child participants received stickers and a set
of small toys for their participation. Adult participants
received compensation at a rate of $10/hour.

Stimuli
Description of the language We designed two artificial
languages: one in which the Tolerance Principle predicts
that learners should form a productive rule and one where
learners should not form a productive rule. To do so, we
first created a rule R for a category of 9 nonsense nouns.
The rule was: “To make a noun plural, add ka.” Next we
used the Tolerance Principle to calculate the number of
regular forms vs. exceptions a productive rule can tolerate in
a category of 9 nouns. Using the predicted value of 4.096
exceptions, we created two conditions: one where a
productive rule should be formed (5 regulars, 4 exceptions),
and one where a productive rule should not be formed (3
regulars, 6 exceptions).
To create our exposure corpus, we assigned each noun a
plural marker that either followed the rule (add ka) or was
an exception (add po, tay, lee bae, muy, or woo), depending
on the condition. Then we used these nouns and markers to
create an exposure corpus of 72 sentences (24 singular and
48 plural). All sentences began with the same nonsense verb
gentif, meaning “there is/are”. Singular sentences were
unmarked (“gentif + NOUN”) and paired with one image of
the corresponding object. Plural sentences were formed
“gentif + NOUN + MARKER” and paired with 2, 4, or 6
images of the corresponding object. There were thus 18
possible sentences in the language: 1 singular and 1 plural
sentence for each noun.
We generated the exposure corpus by allowing noun
frequency to vary along a Zipfian distribution, with nouns
taking the regular form (ka) as the most frequent in both
conditions. Thus the second most frequent noun was
presented half as often as the most frequent noun, the third
most frequent noun was half as often as the second, and so
on. This is important because the distribution of word
frequency in natural language is approximately Zipfian, and
the computation underlying the Tolerance Principle assumes
that word frequency follows this pattern. Making the regular
form the most frequent ensured that its token frequency was
high in both conditions.

Fifteen children (mean = 7.48 years, range = 5.08 – 8.92
years) and twenty adult controls participated in this
experiment. An additional 3 children began the experiment
but did not complete it, and an additional 4 children
participated but were excluded from analysis for failure to
understand the task (quantified as a failure to produce the

exposure sentences in random order. On each trial,

and hear the corresponding singular (for 1) or plural (for 2,
4, or 6) sentence. They were asked to repeat the sentence
aloud (or type it into a response box on Mechanical Turk)
before moving on to the next trial. Every 18 trials they were
given a short break. Children were offered a sticker during
breaks to encourage them to continue in the experiment.
Production Test After exposure, we used a “wug” test to
assess whether children had formed a productive rule
(Berko, 1958). During this test, participants were given
singular sentence-image pairs containing novel nonsense
nouns they had not heard during exposure and were asked to
provide the plural form. Each participant completed 12
production test trials, 2 for each of 6 novel nouns. To
prevent participants from using a plural form based only on
the precise number of instances shown in that trial, the test
items contained 3 or 5 instances of the novel noun (whereas
there were 2, 4, or 6 in the exposure set). Finally, all
participants were given a rating test to ensure they had
learned the nouns and markers they were exposed to.

novel nouns by children when their exposure contained 5
regulars/4 exceptions compared with 3 regulars/6
exceptions. R = the regular form; e = any exception form;
null = no plural marker (unmarked); other = any marker not
present in the exposure (e.g. English [+s]).

Results & Analysis
For each production test trial, participants were asked to
produce the plural form of a novel noun they heard only in a
singular form. These novel productions allowed us to assess
whether participants formed a productive rule. Recall that
the Tolerance Principle predicts that there will be a
categorical distinction between productive and unproductive
(lexically specific) rules. In our artificial language, a
productive rule should be formed if more than 4.096 nouns
obey the rule (as in our 5 regular/4 exception condition), but
not if fewer than 4.096 nouns do (as in our 3 regular/6
exception condition). When a productive rule is formed, it
should be applied to 100% of novel nouns, as is the case for
English past tense ‘add –ed.’
To determine whether participants formed a productive
rule, we performed a one-tailed t-test against the
hypothesized value of 100%. Participants who have formed
a productive rule should, according to the Tolerance
Principle, mark these novel plural sentences with ka 100%
of the time. On the other hand, participants who have not
formed a productive rule should use the ka inflection
significantly less than 100% (and perhaps no more
frequently than other inflection forms are used).
Focusing first on the child production data, Figure 1
shows the percentage that each inflection type was produced
during the production test for participants in the 5 regular/4
exception condition (5R/4E) and the 3 regular/6 exception
condition (3R/6E). These data show that children in the
5R/4E condition mark novel nouns with the ka inflection on
91.7% of plural trials. This value is not statistically different
from 100% (t=1.00, p=0.18). In contrast, in the 3R/6E
condition, children mark novel nouns with the ka inflection
on only 16.9% of plural trials. This value is substantially
and significantly different from 100% (t=6.81, p<0.0001).
Children thus appear to have formed a productive rule when
the Tolerance Principle predicts that they will (in the 5

regular / 4 exception condition), but not when it predicts that
they will not (in the 3 regular / 6 exception condition).
This strong result is further underlined by looking at the
data from individual children. Table 1 shows the number of
children who used the ka inflection on 100% of test trials in
the 5 regular/4 exception condition compared with the 3
regular/6 exception condition. Six out of 7 children
produced the ka inflection on 100% of production trials in
the 5 regular/4 exception condition, while only one out of 8
children did so in the 3 regular/6 exception condition.
Turning next to the adult production data, we find a
somewhat different pattern of results. Adults in the 5R/4E
condition mark novel nouns with the ka inflection on 65.0%
of plural trials; unlike children, this value is significantly
different from our 100% productivity criterion (t=3.23,

2324

p<0.01). Like children, adults in the 3R/6E mark novel
nouns with ka significantly less than 100% of plural trials
(t=4.59, p<0.001) - only 51.7%. That is, for adults, this
contrast is much weaker, and when we compare the use of
the ka inflection between adults to the children, as in Figure
2, we see striking differences between the two. The
Tolerance Principle effect is much more pronounced in
children, who exhibit a much more categorical response in
their use of the ka inflection. Indeed, children, but not
adults, show a significant difference between the use of ka
in the 5R/4E condition and that in the 3R/6E condition
(children: t=4.91, p<0.001, adults: t=0.89, p=0.39).
One possible explanation is that adults are not obeying the
Tolerance Principle and are instead producing ka with the
same frequency they heard this inflection in their input. This
behavior is known as probability matching (Hudson Kam &
Newport, 2005, 2009). Recall that the nouns in our artificial
language follow a Zipfian distribution, with rule-following
nouns being the most frequent in the distribution. Thus the
token frequency of the ka inflection is fairly high in both
conditions: 75% of the plural exposure sentences in the
5R/4E condition, and 58.3% of plural exposure sentences in
the 3R/6E condition. To determine whether this could
explain the difference between the two groups, we analyzed
both child and adult use of ka against the token frequency of
ka in the exposure for the two conditions. We found that
only adults match the token frequency in both the 5R/4E
(t=0.92, p=0.19) and 3R/6E conditions (t=0.63, p=0.27). In
contrast, the child data is not consistent with a probability
matching interpretation. Children in the 5R/4E condition
produce the ka inflection significantly more than the input
frequency (t=2.00, p<0.05) and in the 3R/6E condition
produce the ka inflection significantly less than the input
frequency (t=3.40, p<0.01).

Conclusions & Discussion
Here we have asked whether the Tolerance Principle
accurately predicts when children will generalize a
productive rule in an artificial language learning experiment
and when they will restrict generalization. The Tolerance
Principle is based on the hypothesis that productivity
emerges when it is the most efficient strategy for learners to
access lexical forms. The model allows us to calculate the
number of lexical exceptions there can be to a given rule
before it becomes more efficient for the learner to simply
memorize each lexical form individually. For our 9-noun
artificial category, the Tolerance Principle predicts that a
productive rule will be formed when there are fewer than
4.096 lexical items that are exceptions. We found that, just
as predicted, learners formed a productive rule when there
were 4 lexical items that were exceptions to the rule, but not
when there were 6. These results suggest that the Tolerance
Principle has accurately captured something significant
about the conditions for generalization during learning.
Importantly, the criterion we used to assess whether
learners formed a productive rule was categorical. Our
analysis asked whether learners extended the rule to 100%

of the test trials – the most rigorous possible test of
productivity. We found that, while both children and adults
were more likely to extend a productive rule when there
were 4 exceptions than when there were 6, only children
displayed a categorical distinction between forming a
productive rule and not forming one. As predicted by the
Tolerance Principle, almost every child exposed to 5
regulars/4 exceptions extended the rule to 100% of test
trials, while almost no children exposed to 3 regulars/6
exceptions did (see Table 1). These results for children are
in accord with those cited above for regulars like –ed versus
irregulars like sing/sang. While children in the 3R/6E
condition did occasionally use ka on novel items, their
results are only what one would expect under conditions of
uncertainty. In the absence of a productive rule, children
appear to be unsure how to mark novel forms, most often
using no plural marker (null) and otherwise selecting at
random from among the various markers they heard during
exposure (the ka inflection as well as the exceptions).
The striking difference we observed between children and
adults, shown in Figure 2, led us to ask whether an
alternative model would better predict adult behavior in this
task. The Tolerance Principle is based on the number of
lexical items (types) that observe or violate a pattern, which
is consistent with most approaches to productivity from a
wide range of perspectives (e.g., Plunkett & Marchman
1991). By contrast, adults appear to follow more closely the
token frequencies. Recall that the token frequency of the ka
marker was high in both the 5R/4E and the 3R/6E
conditions, due to the Zipfian distribution of noun frequency
in our exposure corpus – 75% and 58.3%, respectively. We
found that adults produced the ka marker with the same
frequency they heard this marker in their input. This
probability matching behavior has been observed in adult
learners in many other experiments in our lab (e.g. Hudson
Kam & Newport, 2005, 2009). There are several ways to
interpret the differences between children and adults in the
context of computational efficiency, particularly given the
greater cognitive resources of adult learners (Newport,
1990). One possibility is that probability matching may be
the more efficient computational strategy for adult learners.
This would imply that the Tolerance Principle is exclusive
to children, capturing a basic principle of generalization in
rule formation for very young learners. A related possibility
is that only children learn or produce forms categorically.
On this interpretation, the difference between 5R/4E and
3R/6E influences both child and adults learners, but only
children show this difference in such an extreme contrast in
their output. A final possibility is that perhaps adults only
engage probability-matching behavior when they are
learning from a very small number of items; probability
matching may be easy and efficient for adults when there
are only a few items to keep track of. However, when there
are many items to track, it may no longer be efficient to
track and closely match input probabilities. This latter
interpretation is supported by the results in studies on a
different topic, the effect of inconsistent input. In these

2325

studies children and adults look very different in
experiments when the learning task involves only a small
number of items, with adults probability matching and
children maximizing the majority form in their productions.
However, when the number and complexity of the items and
their variations become very large, adults begin to behave
more like children (Hudson-Kam & Newport 2009). In
ongoing work we are exploring this by giving adult
participants our Tolerance Principle tasks with a very large
set of nouns. We hypothesize that, at this higher level of
complexity, adults may begin to exhibit the type of
categorical behavior predicted by the Tolerance Principle.
As mentioned above, children and adults behave
differently both in the present experiments and in the
literature on inconsistent input. Though our results suggest
that adults adopt a similar strategy to perform these two
different tasks, children appear to be handling them
differently. In the literature on inconsistent input, children
produce the form that appears most often in their exposure
nearly 100% of the time (Hudson-Kam & Newport 2005,
2009). While the results of our 5R/4E condition are similar
to these findings, the results from our 3R/6E condition are
quite different. Although the ka marker is the most frequent
marker in the 3R/6E exposure (58% of tokens), children
produce this form with much lower probability than they
were exposed to. This suggests that children are not simply
forming productive rules based on what appears most
frequently in their input, as they do when they are faced
with patterns that are inconsistently marked or probabilistic.
In the present paradigm, in contrast with our studies of
inconsistent input, each lexical item is marked in a
consistent way across trials. When children are exposed to
lexically consistent patterns, they form productive rules
based on the number of lexical items that observe these
patterns, as predicted by the Tolerance Principle. To
examine these issues further, we are conducting an
experiment in which token frequency is matched across
conditions and another in which the rule is assigned to very
low frequency nouns.
As noted above, the computations behind the Tolerance
Principle are based on the assumption that productive rules
emerge when they are the most efficient strategy for
learners. Successful models of many cognitive and neural
processes are based on the same notion. This implies that
the Tolerance Principle may be applicable to rule
acquisition and generalization in domains other than
language. Future work is required to determine whether this
exciting prospect is empirically supported.
