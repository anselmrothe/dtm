Present Study
In this paper, we present the first study to examine the role of
intentionality on adults’ reliance on labels (and other cues)
during categorization. We presented adults with a task in
which they had to form categories for novel natural kind ex-
emplars (e.g., flowers or birds) that were perceptually equi-
distant (perceptual information gave no indication of category
membership) from two Standards. We asked whether a shared
novel label (noun) might motivate adults to group such per-
ceptually ambiguous stimuli with one of the two Standards.
We also compared the usefulness of labels to other cues such
as numbers and symbols that do not refer to object kinds. We
chose numbers because, unlike nonsense labels, they are fa-                    Figure 1: Sample set of Standards and Target

Four sets of black-and-white stimuli were created: one set
of birds, two different sets of flowers, and one set of fish.
Each of these sets consisted of photographs of two stimuli
(Standards) that were morphed through a commercial mor-
phing program into 5 different stimuli (Targets) along a scale
of varying similarity to the originals (Johanson & Papafragou,
2016). Each Target was 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% or 90% similar
to one of the Standards (see Figure 1). The 10% and 30% Tar-
gets were always perceptually closer to Standard 1, whereas

We first examined the percentage of correct responses for un-
ambiguous trials (10%, 30%, 70% and 90%). On these tri-
als, correct responses were those that conformed to percep-
tual similarity. As expected, performance was highly accu-
