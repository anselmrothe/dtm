to spatial signals displayed on the vertical touch bar.
   The design of the interaction game followed Verhoef,
Roberts & Dingemanse (2015). On each trial, a participant
was either the ‘signaller’ or the ‘recipient’, switching roles
after each trial. Trials began when a meaning was displayed
on the signaller’s screen. The signaller then had to record a
signal for this meaning using the vertical bar. Once they
were happy with their signal, it was sent to the recipient,
who could replay the signal on their own screen. On the
basis of this signal, the recipient had to guess the intended
meaning; they indicated their selection by touching the
meaning on a panel that showed all meanings. Players
received feedback after each trial, including both the              Figure 2: Duration signals used by three dyads. Each

   Order Difference (Δord) captured differences in relative
temporal order. Sequence and deictic meanings were
categorized by relative order: past/before < now <

for ‘today’ and ‘next year,’ Order Difference would be:
               Δord = |after/future – now| = |3 – 2| = 1.
   Lastly, we defined pairwise Class Difference (Δclass) as 1
