tentional blink can be reduced by forcing people to approach
the task in a different manner. For example, several studies
have shown that a second task, increases performance on the
attentional blink task (Olivers & Nieuwenhuis, 2005; Taat-
gen, Juvina, Schipper, Borst, & Martens, 2009). This could
indicate that a disruption of the general strategy people use
for the attentional blink actually improves performance.
   A study by Ferlazzo, Lucido, Di Nocera, Fagioli, and Sdoia
(2007) showed that the attentional blink is significantly re-
duced when people are instructed to report the two targets as
one entity: instead of reporting two letters, they were asked
