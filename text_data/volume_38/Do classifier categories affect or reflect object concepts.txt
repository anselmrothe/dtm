Line drawings of everyday objects, familiar to both groups
of participants, were used. Each trial consisted of a target
object and four comparison objects. The target object shared
a classifier with one of the comparison objects. A norming
study was first conducted in which a separate set of twelve
native Mandarin speakers named 240 line drawings of
concrete and imageable objects. Classifier choice for a noun
was not strict (i.e., nouns could take different classifiers),
but there was a clear dominant classifier for each object.
Based on the norming results, we chose noun pairs that
shared the same dominant classifier. The remaining three
comparison objects were “distractors”, and did not share a
classifier with the target. On each trial, pictures of the four
comparison objects were presented on a piece of paper, laid
out in a two-by-two grid. The target object was centered               Figure 2. Mandarin and Dutch speakers’ picture-picture
