Abstract

recent efforts to interpret an agent’s behavior via the intentional stance required to understand joint actions. For example, Baker et al. (2009) developed a computational model for
reasoning about intentions within a sprite world inspired by
the seminal work of Heider and Simmel (1944), in which simple shapes (e.g., red circles or blue triangles) move around in
a constrained environment. Although these studies illustrate
the potential fruitfulness of applying high-level constraints to
reason about the goal underlying observed actions, the investigations have been limited to simplified environments and
movements of rigid objects. Relatively few psychological
studies have used whole-body movements of humans as the
visual input to examine the mechanisms underpinning joint
actions.

We examined the visual perception of joint actions, in which
two individuals coordinate their body movements in space and
time to achieve a joint goal. Animations of interacting action
pairs (partners in human interactions) and non-interacting action pairs (individual actors sampled from different interaction
sequences) were shown in the experiment. Participants were
asked to rate how likely the two actors were interacting. The
rating data were then analyzed using multidimensional scaling
to recover a two-dimensional psychological space for representing joint actions. A descriptive model based on ordinal
logit regression with a sparseness constraint was developed to
account for human judgments by identifying critical features
that signal joint actions. We found that identification of joint
actions could be accomplished by assessing inter-actor correlations between motion features derived from body movements
of individual actions. These critical features may enable rapid
detection of meaningful inter-personal interactions in complex
scenes.
Keywords: joint action; feature selection; human interaction

On the other hand, Marsh et al. (2009) proposed that social
interaction through joint actions can be understood as emerging from dynamical principles across individuals, rather than
relying on explicit reasoning on intention, at least in some situations. For example, Richardson et al. (2007) showed that
connections between humans can arise through synchronization of action patterns (e.g., rocking together when sitting on
rocking chairs side-by-side), rather than mental state attribution. This line of work suggests the possibility that bottomup feature-based mechanisms may play an important role in
signaling joint actions. However, the related studies have
been limited to uninstructed coordination of simple incidental rhythmic movements, which only cover a small range of
possible human actions, and did not aim to probe the important features underpinning meaningful interactions between
actors. In the literature of action recognition, there is rich
evidence showing that humans are sensitive to some signature movements to enable efficient action detection (Casile
& Giese, 2005; Troje & Westhoff, 2006; van Boxtel & Lu,
2015, 2012). Hence, it is conceivable that some critical features of coordinated movements between actors can facilitate
the perception of joint actions.

Introduction
Humans actions provide critical information for understanding other people’s intentions and reacting accordingly. Beyond recognition of individual actions, the ability to engage
in joint action (i.e., when two or more individuals coordinate
their actions in space and time) paves the way for other social
interactions (Sebanz, Bekkering, & Knoblich, 2006; Thurman & Lu, 2014). In everyday life, we constantly coordinate our own actions with those of others to achieve a joint
outcome involving a change in the environment (e.g., lifting
a box together and moving it to a different location), or to
achieve a social goal through human interaction (e.g., walking towards one another and giving a “high-five” as a greeting). Carpenter (2009) provided evidence that the ability to
participate in joint action is already fairly developed after the
first year of life.
However, it is by no means a trivial task to identify whether
two persons are interacting in a meaningful manner solely
from visual input. There are many circumstances in which
individuals incidentally intersect the orbit of other people’s
body movements, creating a scene that might be confusable
with potential interactivity coordinated by the two people.
Hence, it is important to examine what specific information
in a visual input signals engagement in joint action, and to determine the conditions under which joint action emerges from
body movements of individuals.
In the literature, both reasoning-based and feature-based
mechanisms have been proposed to support the recognition
and planning of actions when interacting with the environment or other people. In particular, there have been several

The present study investigated people’s mental representations of joint actions and how well features measuring different types of movement coordination between individual actors can capture human judgments of interaction. We collected human ratings of the degree to which two actors seem
to be interacting with each other for different video clips.
These data were then used to derive a psychological space
representing joint actions between two individuals. Computational models were developed to pinpoint critical features
of coordinated movements used in constructing a representation space for joint actions by fitting the models to human
interactivity ratings.

The Experiment

1

The experiment was designed to investigate perception of
joint actions between two human actors using naturalistic
stimuli. Two human actors were recorded engaging in various forms of social interaction, such as shaking hands, passing a water bottle, and salsa dancing. We then generated the
full set of stimuli by pairing each actor not only with their
true interaction partner, but also with each of the other actors involved in different recorded joint actions (e.g., a salsa
dancer on the left with a person shaking hands on the right).
We sought to determine the extent to which subjects would
recognize true interpersonal interactions through joint action,
and also whether the stimulus properties of non-interacting
stimulus pairs would result in coincidental visual cues that
signal attribution of social interaction in joint action.

Action stimuli were generated from the CMU Mocap
database (http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu) and processed by
the Biological Motion Toolbox (van Boxtel & Lu, 2013). We
selected ten paired interactions in which two human agents
were engaged in various social interactions (see Table 1). A
total of 100 stimuli with paired actions were presented in the
study, including 10 truly interacting with coupled partners
and 90 not interacting. The point-light stimuli were rendered
as stick figures with lines connecting the joints, and videos
lasted 3.67 seconds (110 frames presented at 30 fps).

ratings. The vertical dimension captures activeness of body
movements involved in joint action, whereas the horizontal
dimension associates with social aspects of joint actions with
the exception of “argue” sequence, in which the social content in the point-light display is ambiguous (as this joint action can be interpreted either as an argument or as a normal
conversation between two people).

Procedure
Participants first viewed two videos, one of a single stick figure walking and another running, and were asked to write a
description of what each person was doing. This was to ensure that they understood the format of the videos and were
sufficiently competent in English to complete the remainder
of the experiment. Participants then viewed 25 videos, 5 of
which were chosen from the 10 interacting pairs and 20 of
which were the non-interacting pairs formed from the remaining 5 actors. For each video, participants were asked to “rate
the degree to which the actors appear to be interacting” on a
scale from 1 (Definitely NOT) to 7 (Definitely).
In addition to the 25 videos of interest, participants viewed
two videos that were presented on randomly selected trials
among the other videos in order to check whether they were
paying attention to the task. These were videos of a single
actor walking or running. Participants were asked to use a
slider (as in the rating questions) to choose the action depicted
in each video. Participants who failed either of these attention
checks were excluded from the data analysis.
After the video rating task, participants completed the
Autism Quotient (AQ) questionnaire (Baron-Cohen et al.,
2001), where an attention check was also included.

cal Turk (Mturk). We excluded 26 participants because they
failed one or more of the attention checks during the experiment. Furthermore, we included two additional exclusion
criteria to remove participants who did not pay attention to
the task. The first measure was the standard deviation of each
participant’s interactivity ratings across all the testing trials.
We excluded 5 participants based on the standard deviation
of their ratings being less than 2 z-scores below the mean
standard deviation for all participants. Finally, 4 participants
were excluded for mistakenly providing higher average interactivity ratings for the non-interacting pairs than for the interacting pairs. Data from the remaining 160 participants were
analyzed.
As shown in Figure 1b, human participants yielded significantly higher mean ratings for interacting pairs (mean =
6.21 ± 0.82) than for non-interacting pairs (mean = 4.38 ±
0.27), demonstrating that Mturk participants were sensitive to
true joint actions supporting meaningful human interactions

The Model

(see Figure 1b). Figure 1c showed the mean interactivity rating for each of the 100 pairs of actors. These results can
be visualized as an interactivity-rating matrix in which the
diagonal elements represent mean ratings for the true interaction stimuli, and the off-diagonals represent mean ratings
for non-interacting stimuli. There was substantial variability
in interactivity ratings for the set of non-interacting stimuli,
with some pairs (e.g., two examples in Figure 1a) yielding
high ratings, and other pairs (e.g., giving a high-five and arm
wrestling) yielding relatively lower ratings.

In order to determine what visual features play important
roles in guiding human judgments regarding meaningful interactions between individuals, we developed a descriptive
model based on ordinal logit regression, coupled with a
sparseness constraint to encourage selection of a relatively
small number of discriminative features. We first describe
the model used to predict interactivity judgments for experimental stimuli, and its selection of critical features. We will
then provide details on the computation of five different types
of features from body movements.

We analyzed the matrix of mean interactivity ratings using
multidimensional scaling (MDS). MDS is usually applied to
similarity data, and the rated interactivities for different pairs
of actions can be viewed as analogous to similarities. The
MDS algorithm requires that the input matrix is symmetric
and that its diagonal elements are all ones (i.e., items are maximally similar to themselves). We therefore divided every element in the rating matrix by the maximum rating along the
diagonal, then set all diagonal elements to 1, and finally took
the average of the upper and lower triangles of the matrix to
form a symmetric input matrix.

Rank Prediction and Feature Selection
The model predicts a rank order of interactivity judgments for
each pair of actions shown in the stimulus based on the 2D
coordinates of joints involved in individual actions. To train
the model, human interactivity ratings were converted to rank
order. We clustered average human ratings from the entire
experiment into four rank levels, with equal numbers of cases
assigned to each level. After training, the model predicts the
rank order of the interactivity judgment y for a given unseen
pair of actions, y = 1, · · · , 4, based on the visual features x
derived from the input video. Based on the logit link, we can
write the conditional probability for a rank j = 1, · · · , 4 as
exp(ψ j + x > β)
, (1)
π j (xx) = p(y = j | y ≤ j, x ) =
1 + exp(ψ j + x > β)
where {ψ j } j=1,··· ,4 , thresholds for the rank j, and β, the coefficients for the features are the parameters to be learned. We
j
use a dummy variable yi ∈ {0, 1} to indicate whether the rank
of the i-th instance in the data is j. Then for each instance,
we define a vector y i = (y1i , · · · , y4i )> . Let Y = (yy1 , · · · , y n )>
be the reconstructed responses of the training instances. For
n training instances, the log-likelihood is defined as
`(β, {ψ j } j=1,··· ,4 |X,Y )

Figure 2 shows the results of applying multidimensional
scaling to the rating matrix. Because we used interactivity
rather than similarity ratings, actions that are closer in this
space are more likely to be rated as interactive when paired
together. Note that “shake hands”, “salsa dance”, and “pull
arm”, which are close to one another, are all actions with sustained touch. In addition, the two dimensions appear to reveal distinct psychological variables. The vertical dimension
corresponds to the levels of activity involved, ranging from
highly active actions (e.g., “play 360 whip”, in which two
people hold hands and jump while rotating 360 degrees) to
less active actions (e.g., “give drink”, in which one standing
person passes a can of soft drink to another person standing
next to him). The horizontal dimension appears to be associated with social aspects of joint actions, ranging from aggressive, threatening actions (e.g., one person holds an invisible object and appears to threaten another person), to more
friendly and cooperative joint actions (e.g., two people walking towards each other to give a high five). One exception was
the “argue” joint action, in which two people presumably in
argument raise their arms, but never touch each other. When
this action sequence is converted into a point-light display, the
social content becomes ambiguous (as this joint action can be
interpreted either as an argument or as a normal conversation
between two people). This is confirmed by the result that the
interactivity rating for the “argue” joint action was also the
lowest among all the true interactions.

Since a large number of features are included in the analysis, the model selects the critical features according to a
sparseness constraint that includes an `1 norm penalty for the
coefficients β. Hence, for n instances with p-dimensional feature vectors X and labels Y , we maximize
`(β, {ψ j } j=1,··· ,4 |X,Y ) − λ ∑ |βk |.

Finally, given learned model parameters (i.e., β and ψ) and
the features of a new test stimuli x , the estimated rank ŷ of
interactiveness for the test stimuli can be obtained based on
the following probability for each j = 1, · · · , 4:

In addition, we found a statistically significant correlation between AQ score and discrimination score, r = −0.17,
p = .024. This relationship suggests that participants with
more autistic traits were less able to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting stimuli than participants with
fewer autistic traits. This finding is consistent with other evidence of impaired social cognition in autism.

over time, but the arm movements change when actions unfold over time. To quantify this, for each limb we compute
entropy based on the histogram of moving directions of joints
in two-dimensional space. We first equally quantize joint motion directions into 4 bins as shown in Figure 3, and then
count the frequency of moving directions of each joint on that
limb at each frame in the given temporal window ∆T = 6. To
ensure sensitivity to the influence of joint movement speed,
the frequency counts are weighed by velocity magnitude of
joint movements. If the joints move in a similar direction over
time or remain static, the entropy measure during this period
is low. In contrast, the entropy is high when the joints move
in varied directions and speeds over time. Because actions
progress over time, we obtain a time series of motion entropy
for each limb of individual actors in stimuli. To capture the
coordination of body movements in joint actions, we compute the correlation of motion entropy sequences between the
two actions for each limb pair, resulting in 16 features (i.e., all
possible combination of four limbs in each actor). In addition,
we include another feature to capture the temporal correlation
of whole-body motion entropy sequences for the two actors,
where entropy is calculated by pooling motion from all joints.
In total, set III has 17 features.
Type IV: Correlation of motion trajectories. Two actors
engaged in joint action often perform the same movements at
the same time, e.g., raising arms together to give a high-five.
To capture this kind of limb movement coordination, we calculated the inter-actor correlation of the motion trajectories
for the centers of mass of the four limbs and for the center of
mass of the entire body, yielding a total of 17 features.
Type V: Motion correlation with temporal shifts. A
characteristic of joint actions is that one person acts in response to the other person’s actions. In some situations, limbs
move in a synchronized manner (e.g., each actor lifting arms
in synchrony to give a high-five greeting), which is capture by
feature set IV. In other situations, however, one person moves
their limbs first to initiate an interaction (e.g., a person passing an object to the other person). To capture these temporal
relations in coordinated movements, we introduced a range
of relative temporal shifts (-1.6s, -0.8s, 0.8s, 1.6s) of motion
trajectories between two actors to calculate the correlation indices defined in sets III and IV, yielding 136 features in set V.
Finally, all features were standardized to fix the mean at 0
and the variance at 1 across all training stimuli. Any feature
values within 1.2 standard deviations of the mean were set to
the mean value in order to remove insignificant feature values
and to facilitate the feature selection process.

Figure 3: Illustration of motion entropy for the right limb. In a
time window of ∆T , we compute the moving directions of the
three joints on the right limb at each frame, and compute the
histogram of moving directions, which is re-weighted by the
magnitude of the velocities. The entropy of the histogram is
the motion entropy of the right limb within the time window.

Features of Coordinated Body Movements
A total of 172 features were provided for the model to select.
The features are derived from the coordination of limb movements between two actors. We grouped the features into five
types according to their functional roles.
Type I: Touching. When viewing a pair of actions, one
actor touching the other actor could signal potential joint action with interactive activity (e.g., Shake Hands, Give Drink,
etc.). The feature of touching can be quantified using spatial
distance of two joints, each from one actor in the stimulus.
The spatial distance of joints can be denoted as dit j , where i
and j denote index of body joints from the two individuals
respectively, and t indicates the frame number. An auxiliary
variable Ti j = ∑t 1(dit j < D) is introduced to count the number of frames when a pair of joints between the two actors are
closer than a threshold, i.e., D = 8 pixels. The two joints are
considered to be “touching” each other if Ti j is longer than
τ = 30 frames (i.e., 1 second), which can be denoted as a
dummy variable si j = 1(Ti j > 30). Then we can obtain the
total number of “touching” pairs of joints by S = ∑i j si j . To
eliminate accidental spatial overlap of joints when viewing
the action pairs from a particular viewpoint, the two actors
are defined to be touching at certain point if and only if one or
two pairs of joints between them are considered to be touching, i.e., 1 ≤ S ≤ 2. The touching variable is set as 1 if the
two actors’ joints satisfy this criterion.
Type II: Passing. In some joint actions supporting human
interactions, two actors can pass each other, producing spatial
overlap of the two actors. The second type of features aim to
capture spatial relations between two actors in the stimulus.
Similar to the touching feature, we can also count S using
the same method as defined in the previous paragraph with
thresholds D = 13 and τ = 30. The binary passing variable is
coded as 1 indicating the presence of this feature if S ≥ 3.
Type III: Temporal correlation of body movements.
The third type of features aims to capture the variability of
limb movements over time. Here we define four limbs for an
actor (left arm, right arm, left leg and right leg), with each
limb including 3 joints. For example, if a person only moves
the upper body in joint action (e.g., passing an object while
sitting on a chair), there is no variability of leg movements

Model Results
Rank Predictions for Unseen Interactions
To evaluate whether the model can generalize its learned features to new joint actions, we split the 100 stimuli into two
sets for each of the 10 joint actions: a training set with 81
pairs formed from the other 9 actions, and a testing set with
the remaining 19 pairs, one of which is the truly interacting

pair performing the joint action of interest and 18 of which
are non-interacting pairs formed from the partners in the joint
action of interest coupled with actors from different joint actions. The final model for each of the 10 joint actions is fitted
to select 22 critical features, which yielded the highest correlation between predicted ranks and human ranks.
Table 1 depicts the model’s prediction when tested on each
interactive pair, in comparison to rank orders from human ratings. The overall correlation between model predictions and
human judgments is strong, with r = .85, p < 10−5 . The average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of rank order was 0.47.
The best fitted joint actions are Play Catch, Play 360 Whip,
and Arm Wrestle, which yielded low RMSE (0.08, 0.20, and
0.24 respectively), and the worst fitted actions were High
Five, Argue, and Threaten with high RMSE (0.90, 0.73, and
0.71 respectively). These differences in RMSE across various
joint actions suggest that the descriptive model using features
of coordinated movements is able to predict the rank order of
joint actions which can be defined with strong visual cues,
while the model shows its limitation to other joint actions
which are rich in social content (such as threaten) but less
informative in terms of coordinated movements.
The five features commonly selected across different training sets are 1) touching, 2) correlation between the motion

entropies of the right leg of actor 1 and the left arm of actor 2 with an 0.8s temporal shift, 3) correlation between the
trajectories of the left leg of actor 1 and the left leg of actor 2 with a -1.6s temporal shift, 4) correlation between the
whole-body motion entropies of the two actors, and 5) correlation between the trajectories of the right arm of actor 1
and the left arm of actor 2, which were all chosen on at least
8 test runs with positive coefficients. In particular, touching
was selected on all test runs, showing its generalization to a
large range of joint actions. These results regarding the features commonly selected by the model are robust, as feature
rankings do not change significantly across different sets of
model parameters.

MDS from fitted ranks
We trained the model with all 100 action pairs and let the
model predict the interactiveness of any pair of actions so
that we can derive the model-fitted rating matrix, which was
used to recover the psychological space of joint actions by the
multidimensional scaling algorithm. The joint action space
derived from the model-simulated matrix makes it possible
to examine how different types of features impact similarity between different joint actions. We fit the rating matrix
using the first three feature sets, first four feature sets and

578

all features in the five sets, respectively. The resulting MDS
results are shown in Figure 4. The comparison of modelderived joint action space with human results shows that set
V features play the most important role in mimicking human
judgments, as one dimension corresponds to the amount of
visual motion information in observed action pairs, and the
other dimension is associated with social aspects of joint action. Given that the model is solely based on visual information, without explicitly modeling reasoning of social content
beyond the observed joint actions, the recovery of a sociallyrelevant dimension is intriguing. Note that this dimension
only emerges after introducing the set V features with temporal shift between movement of the two actors. This dimension
may be strongly associated with the degree of synchronization of body movements between two actors. For example,
the friendly impression of the joint action of “walking towards each other to give a friendly high-five greeting” results
from the harmonious body movements created by two actors
in cooperation. In contrast, the perceived aggression of the
joint action of “a person holding an object moves toward the
other actor who follows with an avoiding move” results from
the temporal relation of movements between the two actors.

tions. Our findings shed light on how humans achieve efficient detection of meaningful inter-personal interactions in
complex scenes, paving the way for a deeper understanding
of social cognition.

Conclusions
The experiment reported in this paper showed that human
interactivity ratings provide a tool to gauge the psychological space for representing joint actions. A similar approach
has been employed in previous research on perceiving emotion from arm movements in individual actions (Pollick et
al., 2001). Our study shows that humans represent major two dimensions of joint actions, one concerning visual
motion information and the other concerning social aspects
of joint actions. To further understand the representational
space of joint actions, we assessed the role of critical features
of coordinated movements in signaling human interactions.
Research on recognition of individual actions has identified
critical features involved in the processing of action stimuli
(Casile & Giese, 2005; van Boxtel & Lu, 2015). However,
few previous studies have systematically examined critical
features of coordinated movements in joint actions. Accordingly, the present study fills an important gap in research on
action perception.
Humans can perceive activities jointly performed by two
actors from very impoverished stimuli such as point-light
displays (actions depicted by discrete joints in a motion sequence). Observers can identify whether actors interact in
a meaningful way to achieve a shared outcome involving a
change in the environment or the fulfillment of a social goal.
An important question concerns how the visual system can
generalize action perception to point-light stimuli, which are
rarely observed in the visual world. The present findings suggest that a robust ability to identify joint actions may involve
the extraction of critical features of coordinated body movements between two actors, and making relational connections
between these motion features based on inter-actor correla-
