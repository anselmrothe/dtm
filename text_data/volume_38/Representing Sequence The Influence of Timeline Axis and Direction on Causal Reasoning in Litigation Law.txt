Procedure
Participants were seated at computer workstations equipped
with headphones and guided through the study under the
guise of a mock-trial. First, participants completed the first
measure of spatial construal of time (SCT1 ). Then, they
viewed the stimulus multimedia presentation. Following the
testimony, they answered 25 questions testing their compre-
hension of the case. Then, they constructed a timeline of
events mentioned in the testimony (SCT2 and reasoning mea-
sures). Finally, they were asked to render a verdict. Partic-
ipants were then debriefed. The total runtime averaged 43
minutes.
