Primary Retrieval
When a retrieval attempt is initiated, all currently active
features (e.g., the current temporal context and any retrieval
cues) serve as cues to activate features of memory traces.
Thus, PR is cue-dependent, meaning that the content and

because the 2 features initially activated during PR are now
associated with all 3 of the initially dormant features, instead
of just 1.
   Restudy also reduces retrieval latency, but for a different
reason. Following restudy, the reduction in latency occurs
because more features are active in the first time step (i.e.,
after PR). In other words, learning from restudy increases the
number of features activated by the retrieval cues such that
fewer features need to be filled in during CR. It is important
to note that this type of learning also occurs with successful
test practice. In other words, both restudy and test practice
result in more features activated by the retrieval cues.
However, successful test practice also boosts intra-item
learning, and thus the CR process operates more efficiently
(i.e., fewer time steps) to fill in the remaining features. In
summary, for an immediate final test, accuracy is predicted
to be higher following restudy because restudy boosts PR for
all of the items. In contrast, retrieval latency is predicted to
be faster following test practice because recalled items will
have benefited both from better PR and from more efficient
CR.
   We tested these predictions in a free recall experiment in
which 34 participants studied lists of 15 words, followed by
either restudy or a practice test, and then a final test (this
procedure was repeated 8 times). On the memory tests,
participants were given 90 seconds to recall the 15 words in           Figure 3: Predicted and observed inter-retrieval times in the
