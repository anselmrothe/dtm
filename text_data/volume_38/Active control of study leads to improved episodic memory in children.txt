Abstract
This paper reports an experiment testing whether volitional
control over the presentation of stimuli leads to enhanced
recognition memory in 6- to 8-year-old children. Children
were presented with a simple memory game on an iPad.
During the study phase, for half of the materials children
could decide the order and pacing of stimuli presentation
(active condition). For the other half of the materials, children
observed the study choices of another child (yoked
condition). We found that recognition performance was better
for the objects studied in the active condition as compared to
the yoked condition. Furthermore, we found that the memory
advantages of active learning persisted over a one-week delay
between study and test. Our results support pedagogical
approaches that emphasize self-guided learning and show that
even young children benefit from being able to control how
they learn.
Keywords: active learning, recognition memory, exploration,
metacognition, inquiry learning, cognitive development.

Introduction
Research in both psychology and education has argued
that the opportunity to exert active control over what is
experienced during learning can lead to improved outcomes
as compared to more passive forms of instruction (see
Bruner, Jolly, & Sylva, 1976; Gureckis & Markant, 2012;
Montessori, 1912; Piaget, 1930). In particular, past research
has highlighted the important role of active control in
cognitive development (Held & Hein, 1963). Self-guided
learning is particularly interesting to consider from a
developmental perspective because it requires the
coordination of a range of cognitive processes including
decision making, metacognition, attention, memory, and
learning. However, it is currently unknown whether active
control is associated with improved episodic memory during
development, specifically early childhood. In this paper we
explore the effects of active learning on episodic memory in
6- to 8-year-old children.
Recent experimental evidence with adults shows that
active control of the learning experience can lead to
improvements in episodic memory for objects (Harman,
Humphrey, & Goodale, 1999; Voss, Galvan & Gonsalves

2011; Voss, Gonsalves, Federmeier, Tranel, & Cohen 2011;
Voss, Warren, Gonsalves, Federmeier, Tranel, & Cohen
2011), faces (Liu, Ward, & Markall, 2007), and in spatial
learning tasks (Meijer & Van der Lubbe, 2011; Plancher,
Barra, Orriols, & Piolino, 2013; for a review see Markant,
Ruggeri, Gureckis, & Xu, 2016), as compared to conditions
lacking this control. Most of the studies investigating the
benefits of active control for episodic memory adopt
“yoked” experimental designs involving pairs of learners. In
each pair, one person is the active participant, who controls
the flow of information during learning (e.g., selecting what
to study and for how long) and the other is the yoked
participant, who observes the learning experience generated
by the active participant. By matching the content
experienced during study across conditions, yoked designs
isolate the effects of active decision making on learning and
memory. For example, Voss et al. (2011a; 2011b; 2011c)
presented adult participants with a memory task involving a
set of objects arranged in six 5×5 grids, with only one object
visible at a time through a moving window. Participants
alternated between active study blocks and yoked blocks. In
active study blocks, participants controlled the study
sequence and timing by deciding how to move the window,
whereas in the yoked blocks they observed the study
sequence a previous participant had generated in an active
study block. Participants were then tested on two different
components contributing to accurate memory encoding:
Their recognition memory of the studied objects (whether
they had been studied before or not) and their ability to
recall the locations on the grid where the objects were
presented during study. The results showed an advantage for
the active study condition for both object recognition and
spatial recall that persisted a week after the initial study
session (Voss et al., 2011a). The authors also showed that
the benefits of active encoding were influenced by
participants’ study patterns. Objects studied for longer
durations (Voss et al., 2011a) and revisited more than once
within a short period of time (Voss et al., 2011c) were
recognized more accurately, but only in the active learning
condition (i.e., recognition of objects studied in the yoked
condition did not correlate with study time or with revisits).

Study phase

Test phase

Figure 1. Each study round began with the objects displayed for two seconds. After the objects disappeared, the participant
either selected a location to study (active condition), causing a red frame to appear, followed by the object, or clicked on the
location where the object appeared (yoked condition), anticipated by a red frame. During each test block, participants
clicked on objects that were recognized from the study phase.
Active learners in the above studies might have benefited
from multiple levels of control over the study experience.
For example, active study entails control over the content
(i.e., choosing which object to study next), as well as the
timing of the study sequence (i.e., when to move the
window and for how long to study an object). In a series of
experiments that varied the amount of control experienced
during active study, Markant et al. (2014) found that active
exploration (i.e., decisions about how to navigate the grid)
was not necessary for the advantage from active study to
emerge. Simpler forms of control (for example, merely
controlling the timing of presentation for new objects) also
led to a benefit in recognition as compared with yoked
observation of the same study sequences, suggesting that
multiple levels of active control contribute to improvements
in episodic memory. Moreover, the authors showed that the
active learning advantage for spatial recall was relatively
inconsistent across different versions of the memory task,
and their results did not support the correlation between
recognition memory performance and objects visited more
often or revisited after a short period.
The present study compares the effects of active and
yoked study on episodic memory in 6- to 8-year-old
children, using a variant of the task from Markant et al.
(2014). Based on some of the previous literature, we
expected that active control of study would generally
improve learning outcomes in children. Indeed, Sim et al.
(2015) showed that 7-year-olds learn more effectively when
they are allowed to make decisions about what information
they wish to gather, as compared to yoked observations.
Previous findings also suggest that episodic memory, in
particular, may benefit from the opportunity to actively
control the learning process even at an early age. For
example, active navigation has been shown to lead to
memory improvements by age five (Feldman & Acredolo,
1979; McComas, Dulberg, & Latter, 1997; Poag, Cohen, &
Weatherford, 1983), and self-directed learning has been

shown to enhance short-term memory retention for novel
object-word pairings in 3- to 5-year-old children (Partridge,
McGovern, Yung, & Kidd, 2015).
However, there are also contradictory views in the
literature. In particular, the benefits of active learning might
crucially depend on children’s use of metacognitive process
to control study, as well as on their ability to implement
successful studying strategies. Previous work suggests that
the ability to allocate study time based on the difficulty or
familiarity of the material develops over the course of
childhood (Dufresne & Kobasigawa, 1989; Metcalfe, 2002;
Metcalfe & Finn, 2013). For instance, although 6-graders
demonstrate sensitivity to the strength of their own
memories (Metcalfe, 2002), they are inefficient in
controlling how long to study particular items in order to
achieve the best level of recall. Given these conflicting
results it is an open question whether active control would
lead to benefits in episodic memory of 6- to 8-year-old
children.

Method
Participants
Participants were 29 6- to 8-year-old children (15 female,
Mage = 89.92 months; SD = 8.31 months), recruited in
Berkeley, California, from a participants database. Due to
technical difficulties, the data of three additional children
were not recorded and therefore could not be included in the
analyses.

Materials
Because some children might not have been familiar with
some of the objects included in the original set of stimuli
used by Voss et al. (2011a; e.g., accordion, chisel), we
developed a new set of stimuli. Our set consisted of 192 line
drawings of the most frequent objects mentioned by
children younger than 5-year-olds in their everyday
2

2676

conversations, as recorded by the CHILDES database
(MacWhinney & Snow, 1985), which includes transcripts of
children’s natural speech collected over many years.

Design and procedure
The experimental materials were presented as a simple
game where children were tasked with remembering as
many of the presented objects as possible. The design and
procedure were modeled after Experiment 2 in Markant et
al. (2014). However, we made several modifications to the
previous design to make it suitable for children. First, all the
stimuli were presented on an iPad touchscreen instead of a
computer screen. To select objects, children did not have to
use a mouse, but could touch the objects on the screen
directly. We added two familiarization blocks at the
beginning of the first experimental session, aimed at
introducing the goal of the game and the study procedures,
and at making children comfortable playing with the tablet.
To reduce the total testing time and the general cognitive
load experienced by children, the main experimental session
consisted of two active and two yoked study blocks (four
total blocks, instead of six as in the original study),
presented in alternating order (i.e., active, yoked, active,
yoked). The active block was always presented first, so that
children’s initial active study pattern would not be
influenced by the study pattern observed in the yoked
condition. Each study block included 16 pictures
representing different objects (see Materials), arranged on a
4×4 grid (instead of 25 pictures arranged in a 5x5 grid as in
the original study), so that, in total, children were asked to
memorize 64 pictures.
In contrast to the original design, all 16 objects were
shown on the screen for 2 seconds at the beginning of each
study block, before disappearing under occluders (see
Figure 1, left). In the active blocks, children had 90 seconds
(instead of a minute, as in the original design) to study the
16 objects in order to memorize them. To study an object,
the child touched the corresponding occluder button once. A
red frame appeared for 500ms, followed by the removal of
the occluder that would reveal the hidden object. Before
studying another object, the child had to touch the current
object once more to make it disappear behind the occluder.
In each of the yoked blocks, children were presented with
the 90-second video showing the same objects and study
pattern of one of the previous children’s active learning
blocks, and had the same task (to memorize the objects). To
keep their engagement and attention level comparable to the
active blocks, during yoked blocks children clicked on the
objects as soon as they appeared during the video, although
this click had no effect on the display. As in the active
blocks, a red frame preceded each object for 500ms so that
children had time to allocate their attention to the new study
location before the object appeared. At the end of each
block there was a twenty second break in which children
were briefly reminded of the study procedure for the next
block.

The study phase was immediately followed by a test
phase, comprised of 8 blocks. In each test block, 16 objects
were presented in a 4×4 grid, as in the study blocks (see
Figure 1, right). Across the 8 test blocks, 64 objects were
old objects the children had studied, and 64 were new
objects that were not presented during study. The proportion
of old objects in each block was randomly determined and
all objects were arranged in random locations in the grid.
For each block, participants indicated the objects they had
studied earlier by touching them on the screen. Selected
objects were framed in red (see Figure 1, right) to help
participants keep track of the objects selected as recognized.
The children could deselect any of the previously selected
objects by clicking them again and making the red frame
disappear. When finished selecting objects, participants
were prompted to click on a button to proceed to the next
test block, until the last test block was completed. Children
were not given any feedback about their performance during
or after the test phase. Note that, to shorten the testing time,
the test phase was radically different from that of Markant et
al. (2014), where participants were presented with
individual objects and asked whether they were “Definitely
OLD,” “Probably OLD,” “Probably NEW,” and “Definitely
NEW.” Moreover, participants in our study were not tested
on their spatial recognition memory.
After about one week (range 6 to 15 days; M = 8.45 days;
SD = 1.93 days), children came to the lab for a second
experimental session in which they were asked to complete
8 new test blocks. The 64 objects studied in the first session
were randomly mixed with 64 new objects (i.e., objects that
were not presented during the previous session, neither as
study nor as test objects), again placed in random locations
in the grid. The testing procedure was identical to the test
phase from the first session.

Results
Results were analyzed with respect to: (1) the number of
objects recognized among the ones studied; (2) the false
alarms, that is, the number of objects recognized in the test
blocks that had not been presented in the study blocks; and
(3) the correlations between study experience and
performance, to test whether certain participants’
exploration strategies and patterns lead to better recognition
accuracy. In particular, we examined the correlation
between the recognition accuracy for a certain object and
the time spent studying it, as well as the number of times it
had been visited during study. We also examined the
correlation between participants’ average recognition
accuracy and the distance between subsequent study
locations (that is, the average distance on the grid between
the object currently visible and the one selected next), a
basic measure of how systematically a child explored the
grid. Finally, although we did not test participants’ spatial
recognition directly, we analyzed the correlation between
the location on the grid of the objects in the study phase and
in the test phase, to investigate whether participants were

3

2677

more likely to recognize an object when it was presented in
the same location as in the study phase.
Because six children did not come to the lab for the retest
session, we analyzed the data using mixed model ANOVAs
with study condition (2 levels: active versus yoked) and
session (2 levels: test versus one-week-later retest) as
within-subject variables. We also analyzed the data using a
univariate between-subjects ANOVA, considering the
yoked pairs (i.e., comparing children’s yoked study
conditions with the active study conditions of the
participants they were yoked to). Because we found no
differences between these two sets of analyses, we only
report the results of the mixed model ANOVAS.

Recognition of studied objects. On average,
participants in the active study condition studied 30.45 (SD
= .66) of the 32 objects presented (i.e., 95%).
The key analysis reveals a main effect of study
condition, F(1, 100) = 6.15, p = .015. Children recognized
more of the objects studied in the active study condition
(Mactive = 22.81; SD = 5.31) as compared to the objects
studied in the yoked study condition (Myoked = 20.23; SD =
5.47; see Figure 2), a 10% difference. The distributions of
within-subject differences are shown in Figure 3. We also
found a main effect of session, F(1, 100) = 4.13, p = .045.
Children recognized more of the objects studied in the first
test session (Mtest = 22.47; SD = 5.05) as compared to the
one-week-later retest session (Mretest = 20.33; SD = 5.90; see
Figure 2). There was no reliable interaction effect between
study condition and session (p = .775).
False alarms. We did not find a main effect of session on
the number of objects recognized in the test blocks that had
not been presented in the study blocks, p = .122. However,
in general participants made more false alarms in the retest
(Mretest = 5.91; SD = 7.25) as compared to the first test
session (Mtest = 3.41; SD = 4.07).

However, we found no correlation between recognition
memory and the average distance between subsequent study
locations (that is, the distance on the grid between the object
currently visible and the one selected next), neither in the
active nor in the yoked conditions, for either test or retest
(ps > .1). Finally, we found that recognition accuracy was
not correlated with the distance between the location in
which the objects were presented on the study grid and their
location on the test grid.

Discussion
The present study examined whether active control of
what to study (specifically, of when, for how long and how
many times to process an object to be memorized) leads to
advantages in memory encoding for 6- to 8-year-olds. Using
a memory task modeled after Markant et al. (2014), we
replicated most of the results previously found with adults.
First, children’s episodic memory is more accurate for
objects studied in the active control condition as compared
to the yoked condition where children could merely observe
the active study pattern of a previous participant. Note that
the yoked experimental procedure allows controlling for
study content and timing, which are identical across the two
conditions. The magnitude of the advantage of active
control for memory encoding (10% increase over the yokedstudy condition) is comparable to the effect found with
adults across several versions of the same recognition task
(6% to 10%; see Markant et al., 2014), suggesting that such
benefits are stable across development, in addition to being
robust across different versions of the same tasks (see Voss,
2011a; Markant & Gureckis, 2014).
Second, we found that the benefits of active control for
episodic memory persist a week after the study session (see
also Voss et al., 2011a). Future work will be needed to
assess if the advantage of active learning increases over
longer delays between study and test, as seems to be
suggested by our current results (Mtest = .91; SD = 5.49;
Mretest = 2.82; SD = 2.59).
Third, we found that episodic memory is influenced by
children’s study patterns. Objects studied for a longer time
and objects visited more often were recognized more
accurately, even after a week. However, different from Voss
et al. (2011a; 2011c) and consistent with the results of
Markant et al. (2014), we found that the correlations are
present for the objects studied in the yoked condition as
well: Studying objects more than once and for longer time
generally led to a better memory encoding, without such
study patterns being more beneficial in the active control
rather than in the yoked study condition. The presence of
correlations in both conditions suggests that, as in Markant
et al. (2014), attentional cueing (that is, the appearance of a
red frame anticipating the presentation of the next object)
might be enough to extend the benefits of longer study to
the yoked condition.
Finally, we found that recognition accuracy is not
correlated with the distance between the location in which
the object was presented on the study grid and its location

on the test grid. Having the objects presented in the same
location on the grid across the study and test blocks does not
help recognizing them more accurately, neither in the active
nor in the yoked study condition. These results might speak,
though indirectly, against a robust active learning advantage
for spatial recall (see Markant & Gureckis, 2014). However,
only a direct test of spatial memory would allow
confirmation of this hypothesis.
Although these results are largely consistent with adult
behavior, it could be that an advantage from active control
emerges only later on in child development, possibly as a
result of formal education. To explore this hypothesis, we
are currently replicating this study with 5-year-olds. The
data we collected so far (N = 12) suggest that the active
control of study does not lead to advantages in episodic
memory for preschoolers (Test: Mactive = 21.66; SD = 5.03;
Myoked = 22.75; SD = 4.41; Retest: Mactive = 17.00; SD =
6.63; Myoked = 18.80; SD = 8.69). Although preschoolers
seem to perform as well as older children in the test session,
their episodic memory declines faster than older children.
To explore these developmental differences further, we
plan to develop new versions of the memory task used in
this study in order to identify the underlying cognitive
processes responsible for the memory improvement across
different age groups. A number of mechanisms may mediate
the effects of active control on episodic memory (Markant,
Ruggeri, Gureckis, & Xu, 2016). In particular, it is
important to investigate whether the advantage of active
learning for memory encoding depends on the efficiency of
children’s study strategies and metacognitive decision
making (and therefore being possibly linked to formal
education and schooling), or whether it persists when such
processes do not play a prominent role. For instance,
Partridge et al. (2015) compared active and passive
performance in a word-learning task, in which active control
entailed selecting items from a grid to learn their labels,
whereas passive learning involved observing items in a
predetermined order. Active choice was associated with
improved accuracy in an immediate test, even though the
number of study events and study time was constant across
conditions. Moreover, it is crucial to examine more
thoroughly the role of attention and motivation on the active
learning benefit for memory encoding.
In conclusion, in this paper we demonstrated that active
control of study leads to advantages in memory encoding
for 6- to 8-year-old children. These results have general
implications for informing educational practice, which is
increasingly incorporating the model of inquiry-based
learning, by helping develop more generalizable insights
into the effective implementation of active learning in
educational settings.
