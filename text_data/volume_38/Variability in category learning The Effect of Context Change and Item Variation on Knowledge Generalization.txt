Kersten, Carvalho, 2013). One way to improve category
generalization is by increasing the variation across the
studied items. When people study a category by seeing
several different examples of the category, they are better at
generalizing this knowledge to new items of the category
compared to when they see only a few items repeated
(controlling for total exposure time; e.g., Homa, Cross,
Cornell, Goldman, & Shwartz, 1973; Posner & Keele, 1968;
Wahlheim, Finn, & Jacoby, 2012). For example, learning the
category dog by seeing examples of German Shepherds,
Bulldogs, Chihuahuas, and Poodles would result in better
generalization to new members of the category dog (e.g.,
Pugs) compared to studying only examples of Chihuahuas.
Seeing several different items allows people to notice and
extract the overlapping properties among all examples. This
allows for better subsequent generalization (Hintzman,
1984).
   In sum, both context change and item variation can be seen
as different, perhaps complementary, ways of increasing
study variability with positive results. Here we propose to              Figure 1: Examples of the birds shown during the study.
