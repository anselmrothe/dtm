experiments, we ask whether the distribution of preferences
in a population influences people’s reasoning about the sig-
nificance of preference overlaps. Furthermore, given prior
work on the role of shared beliefs (Soley & Spelke, 2016),
we attempt to separate the effect of shared preferences into
“shared tastes” and “shared knowledge.” We predicted that
(1) rare overlaps in preferences are stronger cues for social
affiliation than common overlaps, (2) shared knowledge has
a larger impact on people’s social affiliation judgments than
do shared tastes, and (3) both the effect of shared knowledge
and tastes would be systematically modulated by prevalence.
                        Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we used a first-person paradigm to ask
whether people use the prevalence of their own preferences
as a cue for social affiliation. Participants first provided their
preferences and generated prevalence estimates for each; they
then chose someone to talk to between two agents who each
shared one of their preferences. We predicted that, even
though both agents have overlapping preferences with the
participant, the relative prevalence of these preferences would
influence the participant’s choice: namely, people might pre-
fer agents who share rarer preferences. In Experiment 1a, we
looked at the effect of shared preferences, broadly construed;         Figure 1: Experiment 1 results. (a) Percentage of participants

Experiment 2b Our results in Exp 2b aligned well with
those in Exp 2a. In the middle two trials where the target
had a preference for one of two games, participants consis-

114 in one, and 64 in none (χ2 (2) = 683, p < 0.001).
   When the target Gazorp’s preferences were unstated (first
trial), most participants chose the friend who knew or liked
the common game (SK: 67.83%; ST: 77.08%; binomial test:
all p < 0.001). Conversely, when the target Gazorp liked or
knew about both games (last trial), most participants chose
the friend who knew or liked the rare game (SK: 67.07%; ST:
57.45%; all p < 0.001).                                             Figure 3: Experiment 2b results. Percentage of participants
