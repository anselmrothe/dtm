analysis, we also tested separately the so-called general
sophistication (calculated with a subset of the items
included in the sub-scales). Finally, we tested the relation
with participants’ experience with ensemble musical
performance encoded as a binary variable. Table 2 presents
a correlation matrix for the outcome variables of the stop-
signal task (SSRT and MISS), the five Gold-MSI sub-scales
and the general sophistication score of the Gold-MSI, as
well as participants’ age. As can be seen from the table, age
related positively with SSRT and MISS. Furthermore, a
negative correlation was found between the proportion of
missed responses on no-signal trials (MISS) and musical
training. Finally, all Gold-MSI measures were strongly
related to each other.
