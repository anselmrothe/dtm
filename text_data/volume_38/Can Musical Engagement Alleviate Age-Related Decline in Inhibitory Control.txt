Abstract
The purpose of our study was to determine whether active
musical engagement alleviates decline in inhibitory control
due to cognitive aging. Given that musical training in young
adults has been shown to improve attentional performance,
we can expect this benefit to persist for older adults as well.
With the help of the stop-signal procedure, we measured
response inhibition of young and older adults who provided a
self-reported assessment of their musical engagement, using
the recently validated Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication
Index. The Gold-MSI addresses a variety of musical activities
and thus offers a more comprehensive measure than ability to
play a musical instrument used in the past. Results of the
experiment showed that older participants had longer stopsignal reaction times, independently of their musical training
and engagement, but musical training and ensemble practice
were negatively related to the proportion of missed responses
suggesting a weak effect of certain types of musical activities
on inhibitory control.

Introduction
Inhibiting an action that has just been initiated, like crossing
the street when the light suddenly turned red, requires high
levels of cognitive control (Verbruggen & Logan, 2008a).
Cognitive control refers to “purpose control mechanisms
that modulate the operation of various cognitive
subprocesses and thereby regulate the dynamics of human
cognition” (Miyake et al., 2000:50); it is used as a cover
term for high-level executive functions that coordinate the
cognitive ability of selective attention and a range of other
complex cognitive processes (e.g., Diamond, 2013; Miyake
et al., 2000; Moreno & Bidelman, 2014). Metaphorically
speaking, cognitive processes in the human mind are
regulated by executive function in a way similar to how the
conductor of a symphony orchestra coordinates the
performance of individual instrumentalists (Brown, 2006).
Response inhibition is considered to be a key component
of higher order executive functions (Miyake et al., 2000).
This type of inhibition is often defined as the ability to stop
actions or responses that are no longer required or
appropriate, in order to support flexible and goal-directed
behavior in dynamic environments (Verbruggen & Logan,
2009a). It is the ability of having control over one’s
attention, thoughts, emotions and behavior (Diamond,
2013). According to a recent study by Moreno & Farzan

(2015), inhibitory control is also an important mediator in
transferring skills between cognitive functions. Without
response inhibition, human behavior would be dominated by
impulsive reactions, habits and distracting factors in the
environment.
Response inhibition also plays a central role in theorizing
about human cognitive aging (e.g., Bedard et al., 2002;
Hasher & Zacks, 1988; Williams et al., 1999). It has often
been argued that, similar to other cognitive functions (i.e.,
working memory, auditory perception, or motor control),
performance on response inhibition declines as we get older
and considerable resources are being spent on training and
improving it. Repeated practice throughout life appears to
be key (e.g., Ericsson, Nandagopal, & Roring, 2009), as
suggested by the mental-exercise hypothesis (Salthouse,
2006). However, existing programs mostly yield mixed
results, particularly with respect to far-transfer to untrained
tasks (Barnett & Ceci, 2002; Owen et al., 2010).
Contrary to the limited impact of specialized cognitive
training tasks and (video-)games, musical training appears
to result in robust domain-independent transfer effects
(Schellenberg, 2004). Playing a musical instrument not only
requires complex motor movements, but also demands high
levels of executive control including selective attention,
switching, inhibition, updating and monitoring (for a
review, see Moreno & Bidelman, 2014). In fact, musicians’
cognitive advantages have been found in a variety of
domains including mathematics (Vaughn, 2000), verbal and
non-verbal skills (Forgeard et al., 2008), and working
memory in both the auditory (Chan, Ho, & Cheung, 1998;
Pallesen et al., 2010) and visual domain (George & Coch,
2011; Weiss et al., 2014).
Existing studies focus on the comparison of musically
trained and untrained individuals, thus disregarding the
potentially advantageous effects of other types of musical
engagement, such as DJ-ing, music engineering and even
frequent passive exposure to music, particularly if
accompanied by emotional response. In addition, the
research of Corrigall, Schellenberg and Misura (2013)
showed that the length of musical training during childhood
and adolescence is strongly related to variables such as
openness-to-experience, IQ and education of parents,
suggesting that simple comparative studies of the relation
between musical training and cognitive abilities in a single
age group are likely to be dealing with several confounding
socio-demographic and personality variables. Finally, from

2807

a cognitive psychological point of view, it is important to
gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie
the relationship between musical performance and different
levels of inhibitory control. There is a wealth of
experimental evidence suggesting that musical experience
enhances inhibitory control at the level of interference
control (e.g., selective attention) in both the auditory (e.g.,
Bialystok & DePape, 2009; Parbery-Clark, Skoe, & Kraus,
2009; Strait & Kraus, 2011) and visual domain (Rodrigues,
Loureiro, & Caramelli, 2013). However, little research has
focused on the effect of musical experience on inhibitory
control at the level of response inhibition (e.g., Moreno et
al., 2014).

Present Study
The present study addresses the following research
question: ‘Can musical engagement alleviate the negative
effect of aging on inhibitory control?’ Based on earlier
research regarding the developmental link between aging
and inhibitory control, we expect that young adults would
be faster in stopping prepotent responses than older adults.
Second, in accordance with research on musical training and
enhanced inhibitory control performance, we expect that
musical engagement would improve inhibitory control in all
ages. In order to test these hypotheses experimentally, we
made use of the stop-signal procedure (e.g., Logan, Cowan,
Davis, 1984; Verbruggen & Logan, 2008a, 2009a). In this
task, the primary performance variable is the amount of time
that is needed to withhold your response when a stop-signal
is given. This variable is also known as the stop-signal
reaction time (SSRT) and provides the latency of the stop
process.

Method
Participants
In total, 120 participants, consisting of two music groups
(musicians and non-musicians) and two age groups (young
and older adults) voluntarily took part in the study. All
participants were native speakers of Dutch. Fifty-eight of
the participants were young adults (28 female; Mage = 22.9
(SD = 3.1), range: 18-29 years), and sixty-two were older
adults (29 female, Mage = 65.5 (SD = 5.5), range: 57-83
years). In order to ensure that skilled musicians were
included in the sample, as well as to address the potential
effect of ensemble musical practice, about a half of the
participants (N=62), both young and older, was recruited
from three Dutch symphony orchestras (the Philips
Symphony Orchestra of Eindhoven, the Wildacker
Orchestra of Goirle and the South Netherlands
Philharmonic), and from the conservatory of Tilburg.

Instrumentation and Material
Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index. In line with
recent research on musical abilities (e.g., Carey et al., 2015),
we used the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index
(Müllensiefen, Gingras, Stewart, & Musil, 2014) to assess

participants’ musical experience. The Gold-MSI is a
comprehensive instrument that was developed to account for
individual differences in active musical engagement beyond
the traditional focus on the ability to play an instrument. It is
based on the assumption that other forms of engagement
such as DJ-ing, music production and music engineering can
have an effect on the cognitive system that is comparable to
the impact of instrumental practice. The Gold-MSI consists
of five sub-scales: active engagement (9 items addressing
resources spent on music, e.g., ‘I am intrigued by musical
styles I am not familiar with and want to find out more’),
perceptual abilities (9 items on accuracy of musical
listening skills, e.g. ‘When I sing, I have no idea whether I
am in tune or not’), musical training (7 items regarding
one’s life history of formal musical training, e.g., ‘I would
not consider myself a musician’), singing abilities (7 items
on singing performance, e.g., ‘I am able to hit the right notes
when I sing along with a recording’), and emotions (6 items
on the ability to discuss emotional musical expressions, e.g.
‘I am able to talk about the emotions that a piece of music
evokes for me’). Next to the five scales, a general measure
of musical sophistication is derived from a subset of items
associated with the five subscales. Table 1 provides an
overview of the dimensions measured by the Gold-MSI
including Cronbach’s alpha.

Stop-Signal Task. The inhibition task was based on the
stop-signal paradigm developed by Logan et al. (1984),
which is considered to be a sophisticated measure of
response inhibition (Diamond, 2013; Verbruggen & Logan,
2008a). In the STOP-IT task (Verbruggen, Logan, &
Stevens, 2008), the presentation of the stop-signal is
adaptive in that it is presented with a variable delay.
Participants are assigned a primary shape judgment task,
discriminating between a square and a circle. A stop-signal
(a 750 Hz tone, 75 ms long) is occasionally presented to
inhibit the judgment reaction (on 25% of the trials). If
inhibition is successful, the stop-signal delay (the interval
between the presentation of the stimulus and the stop-signal,
SSD) will increase in intervals of 50 ms from the default
delay of 250 ms. In case of unsuccessful inhibition, SSD
will decrease with the same interval length (the lowest SSD
being 50 ms).
The task consisted of two phases: a practice block of 32
trials, designed to accustom the participants to the task, and
an experimental phase of three blocks of 64 trials, each
followed by performance feedback presented for 10
seconds. Subsequently, two variables were used as
performance measures on the task: the stop-signal reaction

2808

time (SSRT) and the proportion of missed responses on nosignal trials (MISS). SSRT is considered to serve as a
reliable indication of overall performance, while MISS
provides a useful indication as to which response strategy
had been used during the stop-signal task (Verbruggen et al.,
2008; Verbruggen & Logan, 2009b).
The stimuli for the STOP-IT task were displayed on two
Dell Laptops running on Windows 7 Professional with a
15.6” display, or on an ASUS N56VZ-RH71 running on
Windows 8 with a 15.6” display. For all three laptops, the
response keys “Z” and “/” were covered with a sticker
displaying a square and a circle, respectively. The auditory
stop-signal was presented via a Sennheiser PC 320 headset.

ensemble practice on the proportion of missed responses on
no-signal trials, see Table 3.

Results

As can be seen from the box plots in Figure 1, there was no
effect of musical ensemble experience on the stop-signal
reaction time. However, the proportion of missed responses
was effected by participants’ musical ensemble experience;
non-musicians with no experience had a significant higher
percentages than orchestra musicians.

In order to obtain a comprehensive view of the relation
between musical engagement and inhibitory performance,
we made use of all the five sub-scales obtained with the
Gold-MSI (active engagement, perceptual abilities, musical
training, singing abilities, and emotions). In an additional
analysis, we also tested separately the so-called general
sophistication (calculated with a subset of the items
included in the sub-scales). Finally, we tested the relation
with participants’ experience with ensemble musical
performance encoded as a binary variable. Table 2 presents
a correlation matrix for the outcome variables of the stopsignal task (SSRT and MISS), the five Gold-MSI sub-scales
and the general sophistication score of the Gold-MSI, as
well as participants’ age. As can be seen from the table, age
related positively with SSRT and MISS. Furthermore, a
negative correlation was found between the proportion of
missed responses on no-signal trials (MISS) and musical
training. Finally, all Gold-MSI measures were strongly
related to each other.

Musical Ensemble Practice. Since experience in
performing with a musical ensemble could lead to a
significant improvement in inhibitory control, we first
examined the effect of the binary variable musical ensemble
practice in combination with a participant’s age as possible
predictors of SSRT and MISS. A regression analysis
revealed a significant effect of age for both stop-signal
performance outcomes, with an additional effect of musical

Five Gold-MSI Sub-scales. To capture the relation between
inhibitory control, age and other forms of musical
experience, we subsequently performed a regression
analysis with the five Gold-MSI Sub-scales (active
engagement, perceptual abilities, musical training, singing
abilities, emotions) and age as predictors of SSRT and
MISS. This regression showed a significant effect of age for
both stop-signal performance outcomes, with an additional
effect of the scale ‘musical training’ on the proportion of
missed trials (see Table 4). The same effects were found in
additional two regression analyses in which four SSRToutliers (with SSRT around 700ms) were discarded (results
not reported due to space limit).

Conclusion
Taken together, these results of the stop-signal task suggest
that there is an association between inhibitory control and
aging; as we grow older, our ability to stop responses that
have already been initiated decreases, regardless of musical
engagement and ensemble experience. However, musical
training and ensemble practice were negatively related with
the proportion of missed responses. Therefore, on the
question whether musical engagement alleviates age-related
decline in inhibitory control, we suggest a weak effect of
certain types of musical activities on inhibitory control.

General Musical Sophistication. Finally, to assess the
relation between inhibitory control, age, and general musical
sophistication we carried out a regression analysis with
general musical sophistication and age as predictors of
SSRT and MISS. This regression analysis only revealed a
significant effect of age for both stop-signal performance
outcomes, as listed in Table 5.

Discussion
The purpose of the current study was to determine whether
different forms of musical engagement decrease age-related

2810

decline in inhibitory control. Musical engagement was
assessed with the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index
(Gold-MSI, Müllensiefen et al., 2014). In addition, we
tested the effect of musical ensemble practice on the
behavioral aspect of inhibitory control, that is, response
inhibition, using the stop-signal procedure (Logan et al.,
1984; Verbruggen & Logan, 2008a).
The SSRT, which is the primary performance variable
and indicates the speed of process of inhibitory control
(Verbruggen et al., 2008), increased with age. This is in line
with previous findings (Bedard et al., 2002; Kramer et al.,
1994), though see Williams et al. (1999) for an opposing
view. A possible explanation is that during stop-signal trials,
participants are confronted with constant cognitive demand
on task goals (i.e., stopping and going), and on set shifting
modalities (i.e., auditory and visual stimuli). Therefore, the
observed age-related losses in inhibitory control might be
caused by increased cognitive demand (Bedard et al., 2002;
Verbruggen & Logan, 2009b for similar reasoning).
Next, we found that various kinds of musical engagement
did not improve inhibitory control performance, contrary to
the mental exercise hypothesis (Salthouse, 2006), which
assumes that continued practice helps slow down agerelated losses in cognition. Possibly, the ability to inhibit a
planned action is not only one of the earliest emerging
executive functions but is also maintained the longest
(Barkley, 1997), given the importance of inhibitory control
for survival (e.g., Bedard et al., 2002).
The results obtained in this study are inconsistent with
research of Moreno and colleagues (2014). Arguably, this
might also be due to the use of different paradigms (i.e., the
Go/No-Go paradigm and the stop-signal paradigm). Both
paradigms test different kinds of response inhibition and
require different demands of cognitive control (Verbruggen
& Logan, 2008b).
Finally, we noted that the proportion of missed trials
(MISS) increased with age; however, older adults with
usical ensemble experience and/or musical training had
fewer missed responses than their peers. These outcomes
suggest that older adults use a different response strategy
during the stop-signal task that is aimed at waiting for a
stop-signal to occur. By doing so, they reduce the risk of
pressing on stop-signal trials. This observed waiting strategy
could be attributed to the proactive-adjustment hypothesis
(Verbruggen & Logan, 2009b), which means that during the
stop-signal task, participants proactively change their
response threshold when they expect a stop-signal to occur
on the next few trials. Older adults with musical training
apply the waiting strategy and are better in timing their
response. Perhaps musicians benefit from their extensive
rhythmic experiences and enhanced timing skills, and
auditory-motor expectancies (Brown, Zatorre, & Penhune,
2015), which may help them anticipate thoughts or actions
for unexpected events related to music, such as the stopsignal in the present study (Furuya & Soechting, 2010).
A key contribution of the present study was that we
treated musical expertise as a multifaceted concept.

Classically, the distinction between musicians and nonmusicians was primarily based on participant’s musical
training background. However, the degree of musical
engagement in our study was established by the recently
validated Gold-MSI (Müllensiefen et al., 2014), which
provided a more comprehensive measure than a simple
focus on the ability to play a musical instrument. By
gathering data from young and older adults, we ensured that
the association between personality and early musical
training played a limited role as confounding variable
(Corrigall et al., 2013).
Notwithstanding, some important issues with regard to
musical expertise should be mentioned. Future studies
should examine the exact contribution of ensemble practice
compared to solo practice. In ensemble settings, musicians
are required to listen carefully to different aspects of sounds
produced by other musicians (e.g., intonation, timing, and
dynamics), as well as to observe the visual input provided
by the conductor in order to time their reaction. This,
howeverm is not need in private musical training (Habibi et
al., 2014). Also, different instruments might impact
inhibitory control in various ways. Past research that
compared two specific instrumental groups (violinists
versus pianists) (Carey et al., 2015) found differences in
terms of auditory skills (e.g., violinists showed a greater
ability to detect small changes in pitch than both pianists
and non-musicians), suggesting possible effects on general
cognitive skills as well.
To conclude, the present findings strengthen the idea that
response inhibition decreases during normal cognitive
aging. Although we found no evidence that both musical
training and general musical engagement alleviate the
negative effect of aging on inhibitory control, other life-long
activities, such as occupational complexity, can be explored
in the future. However, musical training and ensemble
practice relates negatively to the proportion of missed
responses suggesting a weak effect of certain types of
musical activities on inhibitory control. Arguably, response
inhibition is an example of a complex executive function
and more research should be undertaken in the future, in
order to enhance our understanding of its components and
how they can be trained effectively.
