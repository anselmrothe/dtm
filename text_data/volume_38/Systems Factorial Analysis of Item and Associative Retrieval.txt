Abstract
Using hierarchical Bayesian estimation of RT distributions, we
present a novel application of Systems Factorial Technology
(Townsend & Nozawa, 1995) to the retrieval of item and associative information from episodic memory. We find that item
and associative information are retrieved concurrently, with
positive memory evidence arising from a holistic match between the test pair and the contents of memory, in which both
item and associative matches are pooled together into a single source. This retrieval architecture is inconsistent with both
strictly serial processing and independence of item and associative information. Pooling of item and associative matches
implies that while item and associative information may be
separable, they are not qualitatively different, nor are qualitatively different processes (e.g., familiarity vs. recollection)
used to retrieve these kinds of information.
Keywords: Memory models; associative recognition; systems
factorial technology; Bayesian statistics.

Introduction
Associations have served as important theoretical constructs
throughout the study of cognition. The present work is concerned with the distinction made in memory between memory
for isolated events—which we refer to as “items”—and memory for combinations of events—which we refer to as “associations”. Given that myriad phenomena in human learning depend on being able to store and retrieve both of these kinds of
information and a dissociation between item and associative
memory is important for a variety of neurological diagnoses,
it is crucial to understand the representations and processes
behind memory for items and associations. In this paper, we
use qualitative properties of response dynamics to determine
what kind of processing is involved in item and associative
retrieval and how the two could be represented in order to
support such processing.
Various theories posit that item and associative information are qualitatively different and are retrieved using independent processes. Linearities in receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) functions obtained in associative recognition
have been argued to reflect the operation of an “all-or-none”
recall process for associative information that is independent of the continuous-valued familiarity process used to assess item information (Yonelinas, 1997). Unfortunately, beyond the difficulty of statistically determining whether a ROC
curve is linear or curvilinear, such functional forms are not,
in fact, diagnostic of the type of processing involved: Curvilinear ROCs are consistent with discrete-state processing
(Province & Rouder, 2012) and linear ROCs are consistent
with continuous-valued processes (Wixted, 2007). Processdissociation procedures (Jacoby, 1991) have also been used
to assess whether associative information must be retrieved
using a distinct recall process, but such procedures do not

lead to accurate estimates of the contribution of different processes even with simulated data (Ratcliff, Van Zandt, & McKoon, 1995), nor has any strong evidence been found for the
operation of multiple retrieval processes in item recognition
(Dunn, 2004; Pratte & Rouder, 2012).
While there is little evidence for a qualitative distinction
between item and associative information, there is good evidence for a quantitative difference. Item recognition accuracy decreases faster over time than associative recognition accuracy (Hockley, 1991, 1992), suggesting that associative recognition gives less weight to context (Murdock,
1997) or that it begins from a baseline that is defined by
item information (Humphreys, Bain, & Pike, 1989). A focus
on studying items impairs associative memory, but a focus
on associative study has no negative impact on item memory (Hockley & Cristi, 1996), and associative recognition depends on the strength of both items and pairs (Buchler, Light,
& Reder, 2008). Studies of retrieval dynamics find that the
ability to discriminate between studied and unstudied items
begins earlier than the ability to distinguish intact from rearranged pairs (Gronlund & Ratcliff, 1989; Rotello & Heit,
2000; Nobel & Shiffrin, 2001). While this delay has been attributed to a qualitatively different “recall-to-reject” process
(Rotello & Heit, 2000; Malmberg, 2008), such a process cannot explain why stronger associations are not retrieved more
quickly (Wickelgren & Corbett, 1977; Dosher, 1984; Nobel
& Shiffrin, 2001) nor why participants do not use partial cues
to aid associative recognition (i.e., using a singly presented
word to retrieve its studied associate; Gronlund & Ratcliff,
1989). Instead, such dynamics are more consistent with the
need to augment an item-only retrieval cue with compound
associative information (Cox & Shiffrin, 2015).
Thus, associative information appears to be at least partially dependent on item information at both storage and retrieval, consistent with the fact that associative interference
occurs only among pairs comprised of the same types of items
(Criss & Shiffrin, 2004; Aue, Criss, & Fischetti, 2012). At the
same time, item information is also affected by the presence
of an association such that recognition of intact item groups
is superior to rearranged item groups even when associative
information is irrelevant (Tulving & Thompson, 1973; Clark
& Shiffrin, 1987). Modeling these and other data required
an assumption that presenting a pair/triplet intact at test led
to an enhancement for memory for the component items, and
that a holistic pair/triplet cue was used during tasks requiring
retrieval of associative information (Clark & Shiffrin, 1992).
Priming studies suggest that this holistic cue may be configural in nature, in that it is only effective when all of the component items are present and there is no effect of a partial

1589

overlap between study and test (Dosher & Rosedale, 1989,
1997).
It is clear that, despite attempts to dissociate item and associative memory, the two appear to be closely related. Unfortunately, extant empirical and theoretical work is not sufficient
to fully characterize their relationship nor whether the processes used to retrieve item and associative information are
in fact separable. The present work is a novel application of
Systems Factorial Technology (SFT; Townsend & Nozawa,
1995) to associative recognition in which we use qualitative
properties of response dynamics to determine what kinds of
processing and interactions are present during the retrieval of
item and associative information from event memory.

Experiment
SFT is a set of experimental and analytical techniques designed to identify the class of model to which an information processing system belongs (for an overview, see Houpt,
Blaha, McIntire, Havig, & Townsend, 2014). It does so by
comparing how processing dynamics differ as the presence
and strength of different information sources is varied. To use
SFT to describe item and associative retrieval, we employ an
associative recognition paradigm in which participants study
a list of pairs. After study, participants are presented with
a series of test pairs and must give a positive response only
to test pairs that exactly match one of the studied pairs. We
separately manipulate the strength of the item and associative
information in each test pair, implementing a double factorial
paradigm. This paradigm allows for the computation of several key SFT statistics needed to characterize the processes
underlying item and associative retrieval.
Two broad classes of processing architecture are parallel
models, in which both item and associative information are
retrieved simultaneously, and serial models, in which one
type of information is not retrieved until the first retrieval
process is finished. For example, many dual-process theories
assume that associative retrieval does not begin until item retrieval has completed, an example of serial processing (Diller,
Nobel, & Shiffrin, 2001; Malmberg, 2008). If either item or
associative information can be used to make a response, the
system is called “self-terminating”. If, however, both types
of information must be retrieved to generate a response, the
system is “exhaustive”.
Item and associative retrieval can also interact. For example, if positive evidence from both item and associative retrieval is pooled into a single ”match” accumulator, we say
that positive responses are facilitated whereas negative responses are inhibited, and vice versa. In the extreme case,
both match and mismatch information might be pooled from
both sources, termed “coactive” processing; in this case, item
and associative information are effectively inseparable, since
it is impossible to tell whence a particular bit of information arose. Just as interactions blur the line between item
and associative retrieval, they make it impossible to make a
meaningful distinction between serial and parallel processing

(Townsend, 1976); interactive serial processes are functionally equivalent to parallel cascade processing (McClelland,
1979). We refer to interactive processes as parallel, however,
since the defining feature of parallel processing is that the two
processes are able to operate concurrently, which is required
by our notion of interaction.
Two SFT statistics can help us diagnose the architecture
and interactions present in item and associative retrieval. First
is the Survivor Interaction Contrast (SIC) function:
SIC(t) = [SLL (t) − SLH (t)] − [SHL (t) − SHH (t)]
where SLL (t) is the survivor function of the response time distribution for correct responses to test pairs with low (L) item
strength and low (L) associative strength, and the other terms
are defined similarly. This statistic represents how the processing dynamics of one factor (item retrieval) change as the
other factor (associative retrieval) changes, taking particular
forms depending on the architecture of the system. In situations where the two factors are selectively influenced by
experimental manipulations and accuracy is high, the form
of the SIC function can be found analytically (Townsend &
Nozawa, 1995). However, when item and associative retrieval may interact—possibly leading to violations of selective influence—and/or demonstrate low to moderate accuracy, the predicted forms of the SIC function can vary. To that
end, we followed Eidels, Houpt, Altieri, Pei, and Townsend
(2011) and Fific, Nosofsky, and Townsend (2008) and obtained SIC predictions for various architectures by simulating
accumulator models with a wide variety of parameter values.
These simulations yielded an allowed set of SIC functions for
each architecture, depicted in Figure 1, which allows models
to be ruled out if the observed SIC is not among the allowed
set.
The other statistic we use to characterize item and associative retrieval is the capacity function, specifically, the capacity
function adapted to low-accuracy settings given by Equation
2 in Townsend and Altieri (2012). This function compares
processing dynamics when two sources of information are
present (i.e., in an intact pair, there is both an item match and
an associative match) to what would be expected if a parallel
unlimited capacity system processed the two sources separately. As shown in Figure 2, this function, termed the ”assessment” function, also takes characteristic forms depend-

ing on the type of processing architecture. Generally speaking, values of the assessment function greater than one reflect facilitation while values less than one indicate inhibition. Jointly, the SIC and assessment functions characterize
how information is combined between item and associative
retrieval and the manner in which it is processed dynamically.

Method
Participants 135 Syracuse University students took part in
this experiment in exchange for course credit.
Materials Stimuli consisted of indoor and outdoor scene
images, 256 × 256 pixels in size, chiefly derived from image
sets used by Konkle, Brady, Alvarez, and Oliva (2010). The
images were first screened to remove any legible writing (to
preclude this as a strategy to remember particular images) as
well as people (since these were particularly salient relative
to other scene content). While space constraints prevent describing the procedure in detail, we used the color histograms
of the images to select a pool of 512 to use in the experiment. Our criteria were designed to simultaneously maximize
within-image symmetry (so the left and right halves would be
similar to each other) and between-image dissimilarity (to reduce interference from other items).
Design Each study/test list was comprised of 16 unique
pairs of image halves, divided evenly into four strength conditions, summarized in Table 1: High associative strength/high
item strength (HH), high associative strength/low item
strength (HL), low associative strength/high item strength
(LH), and low associative strength/low item strength (LL).

High associative strength pairs were presented 3 times during the study list while low associative strength pairs were
presented only once during study. Item strength was manipulated by presenting the two image halves comprising the pair
separately, paired with themselves. The image halves in a
low item strength pair appeared only as part of the study pair.
The image halves in a high item strength pair were shown
during study paired with themselves twice. Thus, in total, the
study list comprised 64 pair presentations: 8 low strength pair
presentations, 24 high strength pair presentations (8 pairs repeated 3 times), and 32 self-pairings of an image half (2 presentations each of the 2 halves of 8 high item strength pairs).
Test lists were comprised of 16 pairs, summarized in Table
2. The 4 pairs in the upper left quadrant are presented intact and should be given a positive response. The remaining
12 pairs in the other 3 quadrants are foils: Rearranged pairs
(quadrant 2) are created by swapping the left and right image
halves of two pairs, as in normal associative recognition studies. Intact novel pairs (quadrant 3) are created by replacing
each image half in an intact pair with the unstudied half of
the respective images. Rearranged novel pairs (quadrant 4)
apply both of these transformations: A pair is rearranged and
then each of its component image halves is replaced with the
unstudied image half.
Procedure Participants engaged in 10 study/test blocks.
Prior to each study block, participants were told that they
would be shown sets of image pairs and that they should try to
remember which images appeared together. Study pairs were
then presented on a white background for 2 seconds at a time,
with a 0.5 second blank between each pair presentation. Presentation order was randomized under the constraint that two
successive pairs did not contain any of the same image halves.
The two image halves subtended approximately 3 degrees of
visual angle, with approximately 0.5 degrees of blank space
between them. Although the image pairs were centered horizontally on the screen, the left and right halves were independently offset from vertical center by random values sampled
uniformly from [-0.25, 0.25] degrees of visual angle. This
offset served two purposes: first, to emphasize that the two
image halves were not meant to be treated as part of the same
image; second, to avoid confusion between successive pair
presentations.
After presentation of all study pairs, participants were informed that they would be shown another set of image pairs
and should give a positive response only to pairs of images

most recent list). Positive and negative responses were randomly mapped to the “F” or “J” keys for each participant.
Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. Test instructions appeared on screen for a
minimum of 15 seconds, after which participants could press
“enter” to proceed to the test list. Each test trial began with
a fixation cross centered on the screen for 0.5 seconds followed by presentation of the test pair (which followed the
same sizing and random vertical offset procedure used during
study). The test pair remained on screen until a response was
made, after which feedback was given. Participants were told
whether their response was “correct” or “incorrect”, with font
color green if correct and red if incorrect. Regardless of correctness, if the response was made in under 300 ms, feedback
included a statement to “please take more time to respond”
and if the response was made in over 4 seconds, feedback included a statement to “please try to respond more quickly”.
Feedback appeared for a minimum of 1 second, an additional
0.5 seconds if the participant was incorrect, and an additional
3 seconds if the response was too fast. A random time sampled at uniform between 0.25 and 0.75 seconds preceded the
onset of the next test trial.

each parameter over subjects, which amounts to excluding terms involving the subject

Hierarchical parametric RT distribution estimation In
contrast to most applications of SFT, we have a large number
of participants but few observations per participant. We therefore estimate RT distributions using a hierarchical Bayesian
model (Rouder, Lu, Speckman, Sun, & Jiang, 2005), which
also enables robust statistical tests. We assume that RT distributions have an Ex-Gaussian form, with likelihood

Results
Prior to analysis, we excluded trials in which the response
time was shorter than 200 ms (47 out of 21,369 trials) or
longer than 5 s (127 trials). Based on the remaining trials,
we excluded participants who failed to give a higher rate of
positive responses to intact pairs than to foils or who did not
give any correct responses in at least one condition. All subsequent analyses were carried out on the remaining 18,760
trials from 118 participants.
Mean proportion of positive responses and median correct RT for each combination of item and associative
strength are given in Table 3. A 4 (item strength) × 4
(associative strength) within-subjects ANOVA on the proportion of positive responses finds main effects of item
strength (F(3, 351) = 298.4, p ∼ 0) and associative strength
(F(3, 351) = 238.3, p ∼ 0) as well as a significant interaction
(F(9, 1053) = 42.4, p ∼ 0). Using the same 4 × 4 ANOVA to
analyze median correct RT, we again find main effects of item
strength (F(3, 351) = 10.44, p ∼ 0) and associative strength
(F(3, 351) = 3.01, p ≈ 0.03) as well as a significant interaction (F(9, 1053) = 8.99, p ∼ 0).

where x is the response time and m, s, and t are the parameters of the distribution. The Ex-Gaussian has been found to
provide a good description of RT distributions in recognition
memory (Ratcliff & Murdock, 1976) and can accommodate a
variety of distribution shapes. For each participant, there are
a total of 4 × 4 × 2 = 32 RT distributions defined by the factorial combination of item strength, associative strength, and
positive/negative response. We estimate these parameters for
each participant according to the multilevel model described
in Figure 3. We report SFT statistics at the group level, based
on the Ex-Gaussian distributions obtained by marginalizing
the three parameters (m, log s, and logt) for each of the 32
distributions over participants (see caption of Figure 3). The
model was implemented in JAGS (Plummer, 2013), which
was used to obtain 10,000 posterior samples split over 10 parallel chains after 2000 iterations of “burn-in” each.
Correct acceptance architecture The SIC function for
correct acceptance of intact pairs (Figure 4, upper left)
demonstrates a credible positive peak (95% credible interval
[CI] of the maximum is [0.024, 0.142]) but no evidence for
any negative deflections (95% CI of the minimum is [-0.013,
0]). We can thus rule out all forms of exhaustive process-

ing except facilitatory, since each of these requires either a
flat SIC or one with a credible negative deflection. In addition, coactive and facilitatory self-terminating processing,
while they allow for SIC’s that are majority positive, require
at least a small early negative deflection; nonetheless, we
withhold ruling these out since this negative deflection may
be too small to detect. The assessment function (Figure 5,
left) is everywhere greater than or equal to one, which is impossible under independent serial or parallel self-terminating
processing and implies facilitation of positive responses. In
sum, the SIC and capacity functions for correct acceptance
are most consistent with facilitatory exhaustive and inhibitory
self-terminating processing, but may allow for coactive or facilitatory self-terminating processing.
Correct rejection architecture While participants should
give a positive response to pairs in the upper left quadrant
of Table 2, they should give negative responses to pairs in
the remaining three quadrants. Within each of these quadrants, item and associative strength is still varied but must
be viewed in reverse: a high strength is actually low evidence in favor of the correct (negative) response. For example, the SIC for Quadrant 2 is given by [SHNH (t) − SHNL (t)] −
[SLNH (t) − SLNL (t)]. Similarly, whenever positive responses
are self-terminating, negative responses must be exhaustive;
and facilitation of positive responses is inhibition for negative responses. Therefore, based on the remaining possible correct acceptance architectures, correct rejections could

arise from inhibitory self-terminating (reverse of facilitatory
exhaustive) or facilitatory exhaustive (reverse of inhibitory
self-terminating) processing, as well as possibly inhibitory
exhaustive or coactive processing.
The SIC’s for the three types of correct rejection (Figure
4) differ quantitatively but are qualitatively similar. None
demonstrate any credible positive deflections (95% CI of the
maximum for quadrant 2 is [0, 0.017], for quadrant 3 is [0,
0.044], and for quadrant 4 is [0, 0.042]), and the SIC for quadrant 2—correct rejection of rearranged pairs—demonstrates
a credible negative deflection (95% CI of the minimum is [0.146, -0.030]). This pattern rules out facilitatory exhaustive
processing, since this does not allow for any negative deflections. The assessment function for correct rejections (Figure
5, right) is never greater than one, consistent with the remaining possible architectures and implying inhibition of negative
responses.
Complete picture We have so far examined the SIC and
assessment functions without regard to the task demands,
namely, that correct acceptances by definition require exhaustive processing of both item and associative information—
only correct rejections can be made on the basis of a single source. After thus ruling out self-terminating processing for correct acceptances—particularly as facilitatory selfterminating processing entails a negative SIC deflection that
we did not observe—we are left with two remaining architectures that can account for the complete qualitative pattern of response dynamics: Parallel facilitatory processing
where positive responses are exhaustive; and fully coactive
processing. In both architectures, positive match information
is pooled between item and associative sources, but in the
case of facilitatory processing, mismatch (negative) information arises separately from item and associative retrieval.

Discussion
Based on measures from Systems Factorial Technology
(Townsend & Nozawa, 1995; Townsend & Altieri, 2012),
we found that item and associative information are retrieved concurrently, with match information pooled between
both sources. It is also possible that mismatch information is pooled, resulting in fully coactive processing, making
item and associative information effectively indistinguishable. While our results allow for the possibility that associative information may be retrieved more slowly than item information (Gronlund & Ratcliff, 1989), our results are inconsistent with strictly serial processing, such as the proposal that
item familiarity is assessed prior to the retrieval of associative
information (e.g., Rotello & Heit, 2000; Malmberg, 2008).
We can also rule out independence of item and associative retrieval. The assumption of independence lies at the core of
both the process dissociation procedure (Jacoby, 1991) and
mixture analysis of ROC curves (Yonelinas, 1997). Because
this assumption is violated, any conclusions drawn within
those frameworks are invalid with respect to item and associative retrieval (for additional arguments along these lines,

1593

see Curran & Hintzman, 1995; Hillstrom & Logan, 1997).
Match information—and possibly mismatch information
in the case of coactive processing—was found to be pooled
between item and associative sources, suggesting that positive memory evidence derives from a holistic match between the pair and the contents of memory. This is consistent with priming studies that find that multiple memory cues
are combined in an interactive fashion (Ratcliff & McKoon,
1988; Dosher & Rosedale, 1989, 1997). The ability for mismatch information to arise separately from multiple sources
has previously been implicated in short-term memory search
(Mewhort & Johns, 2000), and may well apply in the context of long-term associative recognition, particularly as some
of the critical mismatch information in Mewhort and Johns
(2000) was relational in nature. Taken together, separate processing of mismatch information and pooling of match information suggests that while item and associative information
may be separable, they cannot be qualitatively different, otherwise it would not be possible to combine them into a single
holistic match. While this representational schema is not entailed by any extant memory theory, TODAM’s allowance for
separate item and associative traces (Murdock, 1982) allows
that theory the flexibility to construct such a representation.
Our conclusions are based on model-independent qualitative properties of response dynamics, demonstrating how
SFT can be applied in situations in which the number of observations per individual is limited and responses are more
error-prone. By using Bayesian hierarchical estimation of RT
distributions, we can accurately characterize group-level response dynamics. We are limited, however, in what we can
say about the degree to which individuals may vary in their
retrieval architectures; we are currently employing quantitative individual RT modeling (e.g., Ratcliff, 1978; Brown &
Heathcote, 2008) to address this issue. Nonetheless, we have
shown how tools from SFT can be used to answer critical
questions in novel domains.
