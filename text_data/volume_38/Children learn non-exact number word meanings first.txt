Abstract
Children acquire exact meanings for number words in distinct
stages. First, they learn one, then two, and then three and
sometimes four. Finally, children learn to apply the counting
procedure to their entire count list. Although these stages are
ubiquitous and well documented, the foundation of these
meanings remains highly contested. Here we ask whether
children assign preliminary meanings to number words before
learning their exact meanings by examining their responses on
the Give-a-Number task to numbers for which they do not yet
have exact meanings. While several research groups have
approached this question before, we argue that because these
data do not usually conform to a normal distribution, typical
methods of analysis likely underestimate their knowledge.
Using non-parametric analyses, we show that children acquire
non-exact meanings for small number words like one, two,
three, four and possibly for higher numbers well before they
acquire the exact meanings.

Introduction
How do children acquire the meanings of large exact
numbers like “47”? Although humans are able to represent
quantity in absence of language, attested systems of number
representation are either limited to representing small arrays
of objects precisely, or to representing larger quantities
approximately (Feigenson, Dehaene, & Spelke, 2004). No
attested non-verbal system is able to represent large
numbers precisely (Laurence & Margolis, 2005). Here, we
investigated how children acquire labels for exact numbers
by exploring the very first meanings they exhibit. To do
this, we analyzed previously collected data in a simple but
novel fashion and found that, before children learn exact
meanings for words like one, two, three, four, and perhaps
larger numbers, they first learn non-exact meanings.
In the US, children learning English generally begin
number word learning around age 2, by learning to blindly
recite a small subset of number words in sequence (one,
two, three, etc.), much like they learn the alphabet, though
in tandem with procedures that involve pointing at objects
in sequence (Gelman & Gallistel, 1986; Fuson, 1988;
Wynn, 1990, 1992). Not long after, they learn an exact
meaning for the word one, and at this time can give one
object when asked for one, but cannot reliably give larger
numbers when asked. These children are often referred to as
“1-knowers”. After a long delay – around 6 to 9 months
later – children learn an exact meaning for two, and are
called “2-knowers”. Next, they learn three (“3-knowers”),
and sometimes four (“4-knowers”), in sequence. After this,
they appear to discover something more general about

numbers: That the counting procedure which they began
with can be used to label and generate larger sets. Having
noticed this, children become able to give any set within
their count list and map number words to large precise
cardinalities (Wynn, 1990, 1992; see also Schaeffer,
Eggleston, & Scott, 1974). These children are often referred
to as Cardinal Principle knowers or “CP-knowers” (for
discussion see Davidson, Eng, & Barner, 2012; Lipton &
Spelke, 2005; Wagner, Kimura, Cheung, & Barner, 2015).
Several recent studies have explored the role of different
perceptual systems in this learning trajectory. According to
one class of accounts (e.g. Carey, 2009; Klahr & Wallace,
1976; Le Corre & Carey, 2007), the fact that children are
limited to learning labels up to three or four in absence of
counting suggests that these meanings are learned from a
capacity limited system of object representations. Consistent
with this, studies using several distinct experimental
paradigms have found that preverbal infants can keep track
of a maximum of 3 objects in parallel, a capacity sometimes
dubbed “parallel individuation” (Feigenson & Carey, 2003,
2005). Other researchers, however, have argued that number
words might be constructed instead from representations in
the approximate number system, or ANS (e.g. Cantlon,
2012; Spelke & Tsivkin, 2001; Wagner & Johnson, 2011).
The ANS allows humans to represent sets approximately
and compare them according to their ratio, such that 20 vs.
40 and 200 vs. 400 are equally discriminable, whereas 200
vs. 220 is not. These representations appear to be available
from birth (e.g. Brannon, 2002; Xu & Spelke, 2000), and
become sensitive to increasingly finer numerical differences
well into elementary school (Halberda & Feigenson, 2008).
Currently, the relative roles of these two candidate
systems in number word learning is uncertain. First, it is
unclear in principle how either system could supply the
meanings of number words. As argued by Laurence and
Margolis (2005), parallel individuation is a system for
representing the properties and locations of individual
objects, and not the properties of sets – like cardinality.
Further, parallel individuation, though at best useful for
learning small numbers, could not define meanings for
numbers beyond three or four. Meanwhile, the ANS, though
not limited to representing small numbers, is non-exact, and
cannot be used to reliably distinguish large quantities like
817 and 820. Perhaps more important, neither system
supplies the type of logical representations that characterize
counting and the foundations of arithmetic, such as exact
equality and the successor function (i.e., that the successor
of any natural number n is equal to n+1).
In recent years, many researchers have examined
children’s number word knowledge to determine if children

1595

identical patterns of data, others find differences across
tasks. For example, Gunderson et al. only find evidence of
non-exact meanings using the What’s on this Card task,
which requires labeling a presented set. Shaeffer, Eggleston,
and Scott (1974) find the opposite, with better performance
generating sets than labeling them, a result replicated by
Odic, Le Corre, and Halberda (2015). However, in the cases
of Shaeffer et al., Odic et al., and Wagner and Johnson,
comparisons across studies are nearly impossible, since no
common measure was used across studies (e.g., Wynn’s
Give-N criteria for knower level assignments). In the one
case where knower levels were assessed (Odic et al.), this
was done with a counting What’s on this Card task, which
might have underestimated or overestimated children’s
knower levels relative to the standard Give-N task.
A further barrier to understanding these past studies is
that, while most analyze all data, including correct
responses, they focus on children’s mean response as the
dependent variable. This is problematic because although
means provide an excellent characterization of central
tendency for normally distributed data, children’s responses
on the Give-N task violate normality assumptions in
profound ways, as shown in Figure 1, which depicts the
responses of 2-knowers to requests for four and five.

have preliminary meanings prior to exact ones, and if so,
whether these meanings show signatures of parallel
individuation and/or the ANS. If preliminary meanings are
rooted in parallel individuation, such meanings would be
limited to four since higher numbers are beyond the capacity
limit of this system. In contrast, if children have preliminary
meanings rooted in the ANS, these meanings could extend
beyond four and should show a distinct characteristic of the
ANS. Specifically, the standard deviation of children’s
errors should increase as the target numerosities increase
(e.g., Le Corre & Carey, 2007; Wagner & Johnson, 2011).
Although several research groups have pursued these
questions, differences in procedures and analysis have led to
oftentimes conflicting conclusions. Early studies examined
whether children who can count have mappings between the
ANS and large number words (up to 100) using dot-array
estimation tasks. These studies found that many CPknowers (Le Corre & Carey, 2007) and less-skilled counters
(Lipton & Spelke, 2005) lack such mappings.
More recent studies have probed the role of the ANS by
asking whether, before learning to count, children already
show evidence of mappings between number words and
approximate magnitudes for at least a limited set of numbers
beyond their knower level. For instance, Sarnecka and Lee
(2009) argued that if children map number words to the
ANS, then errors on the Give-a-Number (Give-N) should be
normally distributed around the requested numerosities,
with higher means for larger requests. Contrary to this
prediction, they found that the means of incorrect responses
beyond knower level were not higher for larger requests.
However, as we show in the present study, excluding correct
responses and analyzing only errors introduced systematic
bias that underestimates knowledge. Assuming that
children’s responses are random, we expect the mean of
children’s responses (both correct and incorrect) to be the
same across all requested numbers, as assumed by Sarnecka
and Lee in their analysis. Critically, however, removing
correct responses alters this expectation, such that a negative
slope is expected. This is because the size of responses
removed from analyses necessarily increases with the size
of the requested number (e.g., correct responses to requests
for ten are larger than for one). This makes it challenging to
draw conclusions from incorrect responses only.
A more common approach is to examine the means of all
responses beyond children’s knower levels, both correct and
incorrect (e.g., Barner & Bachrach, 2010; Gunderson,
Spaepen, & Levine, 2015; Wagner & Johnson, 2011). Using
data from Give-N and a set labeling task called “What’s on
this Card?”, studies by Barner and Bachrach (2010) and
Gunderson et al. (2015) found that children have non-exact
meanings for the number just beyond their knower level
(KL+1). However, responses for larger numbers (KL+2 and
above) produced a flat slope, suggesting undifferentiated
meanings (see Gunderson et al., 2015, for evidence that
Wagner & Johnson’s data support the same conclusion).
Whereas some studies (Barner & Bachrach, 2010; Le
Corre & Carey, 2007) find that different tasks generate

Figure 1: 2-knowers’ responses for requests for four and five.

Give-N data predictably deviate from the normal
distribution for two reasons. First, most obviously,
normality is violated by the fact that children frequently
give all available items (e.g., 10 out of 10) when they are
uncertain of how to respond (see Figure 1). Second,
children’s responses are both upper- and lower-bounded.
They are upper-bounded by the number of objects the
experimenter chooses to present to the child: If the child is
offered 10 objects, then only 10 can be given, even if the
child might normally wish to give 12 or 15. And they are
lower bounded by the child’s knower level: If a child is a 2knower then responses to three necessarily have a lower
bound of three items. This is because the criteria for 2knower classification require that, 2/3 of the time, the child
gives two objects when asked for two, and further, provides
two objects only when asked for two but not when asked for
other numbers. Thus, the lower bound is given by how we
choose to classify children’s knowledge of numbers.
Though some studies did not attempt a knower level

1596

assignment (e.g., Schaeffer et al., 1974; Wagner & Johnson,
2011) children’s responses are still expected to be lower
bounded because there is ample evidence that children do
acquire exact meanings for number words in stages (e.g.,
Wynn, 1990; 1992), thereby constraining responses to
requests for higher numbers.
These considerations lead us to conclude that all past
studies may underestimate children’s non-exact knowledge
of numbers beyond their knower level, and that differences
in data analysis may explain conflicting results and
asymmetries between different tasks (which vary according
to whether they are subject to problems of upper and lower
bounds). To explore this conjecture, we analyzed data from
a non-titrated variation of the Give-N task and replicate the
analyses of both Sarnecka and Lee (2009) and Gunderson et
al. (2015). In this variation, each child received three trials
for each number tested in a pseudo-randomized order,
regardless of their performance. This is important because it
allowed us to examine children’s responses for inquiries
well beyond their knower level. We compared these
analyses to non-parametric analyses, and show that children
acquire non-exact meanings for small number words like
one, two, three, four and possibly higher numbers well
before they acquire their exact meanings.

Methods
Participants
Our data set combined data from a study of English
monolinguals (Almoammer et al., 2013) and a study of
bilinguals (Wagner et al, 2015). Only subset knowers were
included from each study. Monolinguals were 44 children
aged 2;0 to 4;3 years (M = 3;1). There were 29 bilinguals
including 14 who spoke both English and French (M=3;4,
range = 2;4 – 4;0) and 15 who spoke both English and
Spanish (M=3;8, range = 2;10 – 4;11)1. Only English
dominant bilinguals (i.e. those with higher knower-level
when tested in English) were included, to ensure that
stronger number knowledge in a second knowledge did not
affect performance in English. Analyses below confirm no
difference between monolingual and bilingual children.

Results
Knower Level Classification
In our dataset, there were 28 non-knowers, 15 1-knowers,
16 2-knowers, 11 3-knowers, and 3 4-knowers. Because the
number of 4-knowers was small (n = 3) and because prior
evidence suggests CP-knowers are likely to be misclassified
as 4-knowers (Wagner et. al, 2015), we took a conservative
approach and excluded 4-knowers.
Further division of non-knowers. While it is likely that a
large subset of non-knowers know nothing about the
meanings of number words, it is also possible that some
have begun developing meanings for small numbers like
one and two. To assess this, we divided non-knowers into
two groups. The first group (N=16) was comprised of nonknowers who gave the same number of objects in response
to every request, while children in the second group (N=12)
provided at least two unique responses. We excluded the
first group from our analyses; for the remainder of the
paper, the term non-knower refers only to this second group.

Replication of Sarnecka & Lee (2009)
Replicating Sarnecka and Lee’s (2009) results, we found
that the means of children’s incorrect responses bore no
positive relationship to the target value (see Table 1 and
Figure 2a). The mean incorrect response was significantly
different from the correct response for all but one target
number, five, as the means for all requested numbers were
close to 5. This was true for all knower levels.

Procedures
Give-N Task. This task was adapted from Wynn (1990) and
was used to assess children’s knowledge of number word
meanings in each language the child spoke. The
experimenter began by presenting the child with a plate and
ten similar objects. For each trial, the experimenter asked
the child to place a quantity on the plate, avoiding singular
and plural marking by asking, “Can you put n on the plate?
Put n on the plate and tell me when you’re all done.” Once
the child responded, the experimenter asked, “Is that n? Can
you count and make sure?” and encouraged the child to
1

count. If the child recognized an error, the experimenter
allowed the child to change his/her response.
Children completed up to twenty-one quasi-randomized
trials, consisting of three trials for each of the seven
numbers tested (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10). Children were
defined as an n-knower (e.g., 3-knower) if they correctly
provided n (e.g., 3 fish) on at least two out of the three trials
that n was requested and, of those times that the child
provided n, two-thirds of the times the child did so it was in
response to a request for n. If n was five or higher, the child
was classified as a CP-knower.

Preliminary analyses comparing bilingual and monolingual
data revealed no visual differences in the distribution of responses.
For brevity, we combined both samples in the current report.

Replication of Gunderson et al. (2015)
Rather than rely on incorrect responses only, Gunderson et
al. (2015) analyzed the means of both correct and incorrect
responses, and asked whether the slope of the means for
larger numbers was positive (see Table 2). We applied this
method to our data set (see Figure 2b). By comparing Figure
2a and Figure 2b, we see that a positive slope emerges once
correct responses are included. In Gunderson et al. (2015)’s
first experiment, they found no statistically significant
positive slope from 5 to 9 amongst subset knowers but they
did find a statistically significant positive slope from KL+1
to 9, though this effect was driven primarily by 3-knowers.
Like Gunderson et al. we found no positive slope for subset
knowers from 5 to 10 (0.11, p = 0.12, d = 0.25). However,

1597

the slope from KL+1 to 10 reached statistical significance
(0.13, p = 0.0031, d = 0.48). We also included an additional
analysis of slope, looking at KL+2 to 10 and found that this
slope also reached statistical significance for subset knowers
(0.11, p = 0.037, d = 0.33). Non-knowers did not show a
positive slope for KL+1 to 10, KL+2 to 10, or 5 to 10.

Analyses of Median Responses
Having shown that we replicate previous findings in the
literature using previously deployed analyses, we next
sought to ask whether these studies underestimated
knowledge. Already we have shown that removing correct
responses from an analysis of mean responses
systematically underestimates knowledge of numbers from
one to three. Here we asked whether a focus on means also
results in underestimation of knowledge.
To assess this, our first step was to summarize data by
median response (including both incorrect and correct
responses) as in Figure 2c. In place of an analysis of slope,
we conducted sign tests comparing children’s median
responses on KL+1 to 10, KL+2 to 10 and 5 to 10 (see
Table 3). None of these comparisons were statistically
significant for non-knowers. However, for subset knowers,
sign tests comparing both KL+1 to 10 and the KL+2 to 10
reached statistical significance, both ps < 0.01. Although
subset knowers also showed a positive slope from 5 to 10,
these differences were not significant, p = 0.11.
A second approach to addressing this question compared
children’s responses for requests beyond their knower-level
to chance. To do this, we created a null distribution of
responses which accounted for the fact that children give
certain quantities more frequently than others. For example,
2-knowers gave ten objects on 0.17 of trials for requests
above two. Therefore, if 2-knowers responses are
independent of the requested number, we should expect that
on 17% of requests for ten, 2-knowers will give 10 objects.
We used binomial tests to compare children’s actual
responses (e.g., 2-knowers provided ten objects on 0.31 of
ten trials) to chance (e.g., 0.17) to ask whether they were
more likely to provide correct responses to requests for
numbers from KL+1 to 4, and separately from 5 to 10. We
did not include analyses for KL+2 to 4 since such an
analysis would be limited to responses of three and four by
1- knowers and responses to four by 2-knowers.

The responses of non-knowers did not differ from chance
for requests between KL+1 and 4 or between 5 to 10. In
contrast, subset knowers were more likely than chance to
respond with a correct amount for both requests from KL+1
to 4 from 5 to 10 (see Table 4). To eliminate the possibility
that correct responses for 5 to 10 were driven by children
giving all items (which happened to be 10), we also
separately analyzed requests for 5 and 8 only and found that
subset knowers were still correct more frequently than
chance (0.12; chance = 0.085, p = 0.04).

Discussion
Well before children acquire the exact semantics of
number words, they first acquire non-exact meanings both
for numbers below five, and larger numbers too. To show
this, we analyzed data from the Give-N task, and conducted
analyses that included both correct and incorrect responses,
that focused on median responses rather than means, and
that defined chance responding in a way that respected the
constraints of the Give-N tasks (adjusting for children’s
base rates of responding). Specifically, we replicated the
findings of past studies using their analyses, and then
showed that these studies systematically underestimate
knowledge. Consequently, we provide the first evidence that
standard tasks like Give-N, which have been used for over
40 years, can detect children’s non-exact meanings for
number words well beyond their knower level.
Our findings are compatible with the idea that children’s
preliminary number meanings are rooted in the approximate
number system. However, evidence from other studies
suggests that even much older children – e.g., 7 year olds –
lack strong associative mappings between the ANS and
number words beyond 5 (Sullivan & Barner, 2014). To the
extent that these older children are able to make accurate
estimates, these are driven by a global structure mapping
wherein the relation between number words (e.g., ten) and
particular magnitudes (e.g., 10) are highly malleable across
contexts, unlike the meanings of the positive integers, which
remain fixed independent of context.
An alternative explanation consistent with both the
current data and the notion that estimates above 5 are driven
more by structure mappings than mappings between number
words and the ANS is that children’s responses are guided
by principled knowledge that numbers later in the count list
denote greater quantities (the “later-greater” principle).
Contrary to this hypothesis, however, several previous
studies have found that no knowledge of this principle in
subset knowers and even in many CP-knowers (Le Corre,
2014; Condry & Spelke, 2008; Davidson et al., 2012).
These studies in older children point to the possibility that
the knowledge driving children’s inexact meanings (whether
ANS mappings or the later-greater principle) may not
extend to their entire count list. Consistent with this idea is
data showing that other types of numerical knowledge,
specifically the knowledge of numerical successors, is first
acquired incrementally long before children abstract the

(Wagner et al, 2015; Davidson et al, 2012).
Determining the source of children’s inexact meanings for
number words will inform what information children have
at their disposal when learning the counting principles. This
knowledge could be a useful stepping stone to acquiring the
counting principles, but on it’s own, it cannot be sufficient,
given that children are forming these inexact meanings
months before learning the counting principles.
