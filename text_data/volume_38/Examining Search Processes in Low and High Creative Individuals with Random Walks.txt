Abstract

wandering to connect distant associations, which are then
evaluated for their appropriateness (Christoff, 2013;
Sawyer, 2011).
Recent studies have used computational network science
to analyze semantic memory structure as a semantic
network (e.g., Baronchelli et al., 2013). A semantic network
is a set of nodes and edges, where nodes correspond to
words or concepts and edges connect pairs of nodes and
signify some sense of association between them. Previous
theoretical work has proposed that creative solutions and
insight are the result of either sophisticated search processes
and/or the creation of new edges in semantic networks
(Schilling, 2005). However, previous work has not
examined the nature of this search process in creativity,
whether it be controlled or uncontrolled.
In this paper, we examine how well uncontrolled search
on semantic networks can capture some of the differences in
how low and high creative individuals conduct cognitive
search. To this end, we simulate random walks over the
semantic networks of low and high creative individuals.
Based on the associative theory of creativity, we
hypothesize that the structure of the semantic network of
high creative individuals enables them to use simple search
processes that reach further and to more weakly connected
concepts, than low creative individuals. Specifically, we
predict that random walks over the semantic network of
high creative individuals will reach more nodes than the
walks over the network of low creative individuals. Further,
the similarity of the initial and final visited nodes in the
walk will be weaker for the network of high creative
individuals than for the network of low creative individuals.
The plan of the paper is as follows: First we describe
previous work on uncontrolled search and differences in
semantic memory structure between low and high creative
individuals. Next, we investigate whether a purely
uncontrolled random walk process on the two semantic
networks captures differences in cognitive search
performance between low and high creative individuals. We
conclude with a discussion of the implications and
limitations of our simulation results.

The creative process involves several cognitive processes,
such as working memory, controlled attention and task
switching. One other process is cognitive search over
semantic memory. These search processes can be controlled
(e.g., problem solving guided by a heuristic), or uncontrolled
(e.g., mind wandering). However, the nature of this search in
relation to creativity has rarely been examined from a formal
perspective. To do this, we use a random walk model to
simulate uncontrolled cognitive search over semantic
networks of low and high creative individuals with an equal
number of nodes and edges. We show that a random walk
over the semantic network of high creative individuals “finds”
more unique words and moves further through the network
for a given number of steps. Our findings are consistent with
the associative theory of creativity, which posits that the
structure of semantic memory facilitates search processes to
find creative solutions.

Introduction
How do people vary in their creative ability? While
creativity is a multifaceted construct, here we focus on the
role of representation and search processes in memory to
creative ability. One relevant theory of what differentiates
low and high creative individuals focuses on bottom-up
factors: the structure of semantic memory (Kenett, Anaki, &
Faust, 2014). An alternative theory focuses on the role of
top-down, executive processes. This theory argues that topdown control is necessary to produce observed differences
between low and high creative individuals (Benedek et al.,
2014). In this paper, we demonstrate that a bottom-up,
associative account is sufficient to produce some of these
results.
Previous work on the relation between creativity and
cognitive search has examined how different search
processes over semantic memory (memory for knowledge
and facts, Jones, Willits, & Dennis, 2015) are related to
goal-directed creative tasks (Christoff, 2013; Sawyer, 2011).
One major distinction between search processes is whether
they are controlled (goal-directed) or uncontrolled
(undirected; Christoff, 2013). Controlled search processes
involve goal directed search for a specific creative solution
(Mednick, 1962). Uncontrolled search processes wander
across semantic memory, which can lead to novel
combinations and insight (Baird et al., 2012). According to
this account, differences in creative behavior are related to
differences in memory structure that facilitates random mind

Previous work
Creative and Uncontrolled Search
Current neurocognitive research has progressed our
understanding of the roles of specific cognitive processes
(such as working memory and attention) and how they

313

interact to produce creative behavior (Sawyer, 2011). One
of these processes is the ability to search through memory
and connect seemingly unrelated concepts into something
novel (Mednick, 1962). Mednick (1962) theorized that
novel combinations of unconnected concepts are more
creative the farther apart they are in memory (but see
Sawyer, 2011 for an alternative viewpoint). He proposed
that this will be evident in the type of associations low and
high creative individuals generate to cue words: When
presented with the cue word table, low creative individuals
will generate responses that are mainly restricted to the
common response chair. Conversely, high creative
individuals will generate less frequent responses such as leg
and food (Mednick, 1962). To test his theory, Mednick et al.
(1964) had low and high creative individuals generate
responses to cue words in a fixed amount of time. He found
that high creative individuals generate more responses than
low creative individuals. However, what can researchers
infer about the differences in representation and processes
of low and high creative individuals based on these results?
To do so requires a formal account of the representation and
processes responsible for producing responses to cognitive
search tasks.
A classic uncontrolled search process is spreading
activation (Collins and Loftus, 1975). According to this
search process, activation spreads over links through words
and quickly dissipates with time and distance. Spreading
activation over networks can also capture similarity
relations: Two words are similar to the extent that they
activate each other. Computationally, spreading activation
can be implemented as a random walk over a network.
Starting at a particular node, a random walk selects an
outbound edge with a probability proportional to the edge’s
weight and moves across it. As this process progresses, it
explores more nodes in the network. Analogous to how
spreading activation decays over a network, the probability
that a walk moves from one node to another decays in their
distance. Thus, the probability of moving from one node to
another in a small number of steps captures their similarity.
Recent research has explored how random walk models
can capture memory retrieval (Abbott, Austerweil, &
Griffiths, 2015; Capitán et al., 2012; Griffiths, Steyvers, &
Firl, 2007) and performance in creative tasks which require
cognitive search (Bourgin, Abbott, Griffiths, Smith, & Vul,
2014; Smith & Vul, 2015). These studies investigated how
well a random walk on a representation captures general
performance on cognitive search and creative tasks.
However, they have not examined whether differences in
creative ability can be understood in terms of the same
random walk process on different representations.
In the present study, we conduct naïve random walk
simulations on the semantic networks of low semantic
creative (LSC) and high semantic creative (HSC)
individuals estimated in a previous study (Kenett et al.,
2014). This study found that the semantic networks of low
and high creative individuals had different structural
properties. This was the case despite both networks having

an equal number of nodes, edges and average number of
edges per node.
Using Kenett et al.’s semantic networks of LSC and HSC
individuals, we can test Mednick’s (1962) associative theory
of creativity using random walks. We formalize the search
process proposed by the associative theory as an
uncontrolled random walk, and predict that (on average) a
random walk over the semantic network of HSC individuals
will visit more nodes that are weaker in similarity than an
equivalent length random walk over the semantic network
of LSC individuals. This would reproduce previously
reported differences in human performance by LSC and
HSC individuals in generating and judging the strength of
associative responses to cue words (Mednick et al., 1964;
Rossman & Fink, 2010). We test these predictions via
random walk simulations to see whether differences in
representation are sufficient to produce observed differences
in creative performance.

Semantic Networks of LSC and HSC Individuals
Here we describe how Kenett et al., (2014) estimated
different semantic networks for LSC and HSC individuals.
Creativity Assessment - Participants (N = 140) were
recruited as part of a larger research study on individual
differences in creative ability (Kenett et al., 2014). They
completed the following creativity tasks: The Remote
Association Test, which measures associative thinking
related to creativity (Nevo & Levin, 1978), Tel-Aviv
University Creativity Test (Milgram & Milgram, 1976), a
battery of divergent thinking tests (e.g., what are all the
things you can do with a brick), frequently used in creativity
research (Runco & Acar, 2012), and the Comprehension of
Metaphors task (Faust, 2012), which compares processing
of word-pairs that have different semantic relations (either
literal, conventional metaphoric, novel metaphoric, or are
meaningless). Participants were classified as LSC or HSC
individuals using these scores. To do so, Kenett et al. (2014)
used the JMP classification and regression tree approach
(Galimberti & Soffritti, 2011), to predict performance on the
Remote Association Test based on their divergent thinking
performance (scores on fluency and quality of responses).
Using the decision tree, they defined participants in the
lower third of performance as low creative and those in the
upper third as high creative. This classification was verified
based on the performance of the two groups on the
Comprehension of Metaphors task (not used to construct the
decision tree).
Semantic Network Estimation - The semantic networks of
the LSC and HSC groups were computed using the
computational approach developed by Kenett et al. (2011).
This approach consists of two parts. First, participants
generated continuous free association responses to cue
words. The LSC and HSC groups generated free
associations to a list of 96 cue words. The cue words were
based on fluency norms collected to a list of 36 categorical
norms gathered by Henik and Kaplan (2005; e.g. fruits,
trees, countries). The top four high frequency words from

314

each category were selected. These words were then tested
for their degree of concreteness, on a seven point Likert
scale, and only concrete words were selected (words scoring
more than three points on the scale). The final pool of cue
words consisted of 96 words from 24 categories.
Kenett et al. (2014) used the associative responses for
these 96 cue words to estimate semantic networks for LSC
and HSC individuals. This was achieved in the following
steps: First, the data was preprocessed to standardize
responses and fix any spelling mistakes. This resulted in a
matrix where each row was a unique associative response,
each column was a cue word and each cell contained the
amount of participants generating response i to cue word j.
Second, a N x N association matrix A was constructed,
where element (i, j) was the Pearson’s correlation of the
response similarity between cue words i and j. Spurious
correlations from the connectivity matrix were removed
using a filter (planar maximal filtered graphs) and any nonzero cells were binarized to equal one. Thus, the resulting
semantic network is unweighted (the weight of any existing
edge is one) and undirected (symmetric relations). Although
we plan to explore weighted networks in the future, some
previous work has found qualitatively similar behavior for
unweighted and weighted semantic networks (Abbott et al.,
2015) and so, we used an unweighted network for simplicity
and brevity. Importantly, the semantic networks for different
groups (LSC and HSC) were comprised of the same nodes
(96 cue words) and had an equal number of edges (282
edges). Further, the average degree, the average amount of
edges per node in both networks was equal (average of 5.88
edges per node). Thus, differences in behavior between the
random walks on the two networks cannot be explained as
simply there being more connections in one of the networks.

Second, we choose an initial starting node (cue word) for
both networks from which the walk initiates. For each walk
simulation, the initial node (𝑋𝐼𝑁 ) is randomly chosen from a
uniform distribution over the 96 nodes in the network. The
random walk starts at 𝑋0 = 𝑋𝐼𝑁 , and then at step n
randomly generates the next state 𝑋𝑛+1 according to the
transition matrix T. In this model, the transition matrix is
unweighted, meaning that the next state is uniformly chosen
at random from all nodes connected to node 𝑋𝑛 . Further, our
model is a non-jumping model, which means that the cue
word simply initiates the walk. We did not include jumps
because previous work found that they did not substantially
affect the pattern of first visits to each node by random
walks (Abbott et al., 2015).
After running the random walk simulations on the LSC
and HSC semantic networks, we examined differences in
“search” behavior (the behavior of the random walks) due to
the structure of the semantic networks. We computed two
different measures of how “creative” a walk was to examine
whether the random walks on the LSC and HSC networks
capture differences in creativity.
The first measure of walk creativity was the number of
unique nodes visited by the search. This measure indicates
the breadth of the search achieved by the walk. The second
measure of walk creativity was the similarity between the
initial and final node visited by the walk. This was defined
as
𝑠 = exp (−𝐷67 )

where 𝐷𝑖𝑗 is the length of the shortest path between initial (i)
and final (j) nodes through the network. The shortest path
between two nodes is the smallest number of edges a walk
could traverse to get from one node to the other node. Both
measures were averaged over simulations per different
numbers of steps and compared via Wilcoxon signed rank
tests.

Current Work
A naïve random walk approach was used to examine the
theory that HSC individuals can search further in their
semantic networks and reach weaker related nodes.
Accordingly, we examine two properties of each walk: the
amount of unique visited nodes (indicating the breadth of
the search) and the distance between initial and final visited
nodes (indicating the strength between initial and final
nodes). The random walk analysis over the semantic
networks of the two groups was conducted in the following
steps: First, we computed the transition probability matrix
for each group. As the networks are unweighted, and
undirected, the transition probability 𝑇𝑖𝑗 of moving from
node i to node j is
𝑇𝑖𝑗 =

𝐴𝑖𝑗
𝑛
𝑘=1 𝐴𝑘𝑗

Results
We ran 10,000 random walks over both networks for a
varying number of steps (10-200 steps in increments of 10
steps). Similar results held for 100,000 simulations. At the
start of each simulation, the initial node was randomly
chosen and identical for both networks. For each simulation,
we computed the mean number of unique nodes visited
during the walk and the similarity score between initial and
final nodes per amount of steps for the two groups (as
described in the subsequent subsections).

Unique Visited Nodes
For both walks, the average amount of unique visited nodes
in the network increased with the number of steps of the
walk. For the walks on the LSC network, the average
number of unique visited nodes ranged from 7.21 (1.42)1 for

where 𝐴𝑖𝑗 is the fully processed association matrix (1 if i is
connected to j, and 0 otherwise) and the denominator is the
number of nodes that node j is connected to.

walks on the HSC network. Related to this, Beaty & Silvia
(2012) found that as more responses are generated in
fluency tasks, the responses become more “creative” (as
judged by subjective measures of the novelty and
uniqueness). From 120 steps onwards, the results are less
consistent and even reverse. For example, at 150-160 steps,
the walk over the LSC network had a smaller average
similarity score than the walk over the HSC network (Figure
2).

average amount of unique visited nodes ranged from 7.24
(1.43) for simulations taking 10 steps to 54.94 (9.34) for
simulations taking 200 steps. Overall, walks over the HSC
network visited more unique nodes for a given number of
steps than over the LSC network (Wilcoxon rank test
significant at p < 0.001 for all walks longer than 20-steps).

path) between initial and final visited nodes by walks over
the LSC and HSC networks varying the number of steps.

As shown in Figure 1, the difference between the number
of unique visited nodes by the HSC and LSC walks
increases with the number of steps. Generally, the increase
is monotonic, but it is not always. In these cases, it is likely
that increasing the number of steps allowed the LSC walk
(on average) to reach nodes it had not reached with fewer
steps, but were already reached by the HSC walk. It is not
simply noisy – running more simulations led to similar
results. These results are consistent with previous work
showing that high creative individuals generate more
associative responses than low creative individuals
(Mednick et al., 1964).

This reversal in the difference score of the average
similarity between initial and final visited walks by the two
groups may be due to the large number of steps in the walk
relative to the number of nodes (96), which enables the walk
to traverse most of the network. Thus, the walk over the
LSC network may reach farther in the network which will
lower its average similarity score.
One question we had was whether the differences in
similarity are simply due to the HSC network visiting more
unique nodes. To control for this possible confound, we
examined the similarity between the starting and ending
node holding the number of visited nodes constant between
walks on the two networks (rather than the number of steps).
Due to the small amount of unique visited nodes for the 10
and 20 step walks, the truncated final node (the kth unique
visited node after the initial starting node) was set to three
for the 10-step walk, four for the 20-step walk and five for
30-step and onwards. Overall, walks over the HSC network
resulted in a smaller similarity score between the initial and
final truncated node compared to walks on the LSC network
(Wilcoxon rank test significance at p < 0.01 for all steps;
Figure 3). The reason that the relation between step size and
similarity of initial and final node became unreliable in
Figure 2 after 110 steps may be due to the HSC random
walk traversing most of the network. We plan to investigate
this in future work by examining whether the HSC random
walk reaches stationarity before the LSC random walk.

Similarity Between Initial and Final Nodes
For walks on both networks, the average similarity score
between the initial and final node in the walk decreased with
the number of steps taken by the walk. For the simulations
on the LSC network, the average similarity score ranged
from 0.22 (0.22) for simulations taking 10 steps to 0.07
(0.14) for simulations taking 200 steps. For the simulations
on the HSC network, the average similarity score ranged
from 0.21 (0.22) for simulations taking 10 steps to 0.07
(0.13) for simulations taking 200 steps. Up to 110 steps,
HSC walks resulted in lower similarity scores between the
initial and final nodes (Wilcoxon rank test significance at p
< 0.1 for 20-steps and p < 0.01 for all other number of
steps). This reflects that until 110 steps, walks on the LSC
network tended to remain closer to the initial node than

search behavior, these findings support the associative
theory of creativity, which posits that HSC individuals have
a semantic memory structure that facilitates novel
combinations (Kenett et al., 2014; Mednick, 1962).
There are limitations to this study. First, we treated
creativity as a binary construct due to technical constraints
(existing semantic network estimation techniques require
large data sets). However, creativity is a continuous
construct and not a categorical one. Future research should
examine the search processes over semantic networks in
individuals (see Zemla, Kenett, Jun, & Austerweil, 2016) to
provide a better understanding of how search processes
relate to creative ability. Second, we only explored
undirected, unweighted random walks. Future research
should also examine the effect of using directed and
weighted random walks on the different semantic networks.
Finally, the semantic networks of LSC and HSC individuals
were constructed based on free associations. Some
researchers have argued that explaining cognitive search
behavior as a random walk over a semantic network
estimated from free association data is potentially circular
(Hills, Todd, & Jones, 2015). However, in our research,
creative ability was measured independently with different
tasks (divergent thinking) than those used for representing
their semantic networks (free associations). Thus, our results
are limited to the measures we used to classify participants
into LSC and HSC individuals, as well as the way we
constructed the semantic networks and measured the
random walks. Future research should use different
measures for estimating creativity, and the semantic
networks of low and high creative individuals.
More generally, this work demonstrates how random
walk models can be used to examine thought processes in
different populations, such as LSC and HSC individuals.
Random walks are a computational implementation of the
theoretical concept of spreading activation. This enables
researchers to use these models to investigate how well
uncontrolled search processes can capture different
cognitive processes operating on semantic memory, such as
mind wandering or creative thought (Christoff, 2013).
Specifically, such models can be used to understand the
contribution of both bottom-up and top-down processes in
creativity. We do not expect a completely uncontrolled
search process (such as the naïve random walk) to explain
creativity in all of its complexity. Rather, we intend to use it
as a yardstick for determining whether controlled search
processes are necessary or if randomness is sufficient to
produce the observed variations in behavior (similar to
studies of drift in computational models of evolutionary
genetics; Reali & Griffiths, 2009). In future work, we also
plan to incorporate controlled search processes into the
model and see what sort of behavior it can produce that
cannot be replicated by an uncontrolled search process
(keeping the semantic networks constant). This will guide
the development of experiments that provide stronger results
capable of dissociating bottom-up and top-down processes
contributing to creativity.

Discussion
In this paper, we examined how differences in semantic
memory structure and search processes interact and relate to
individual differences in creative ability. According to the
associative theory of creativity, individual differences in
creativity should be related to differences in semantic
memory structure, which in turn facilitate cognitive search
(Kenett et al., 2014; Mednick, 1962). To test this theory, we
conducted random walk simulations and examined
differences in how uncontrolled search behaves over
semantic memory for HSC and LSC individuals.
Our work is situated with a growing amount of research
studying uncontrolled thought processes (Christoff, 2013),
and complements existing research by examining the search
processes of LSC and HSC individuals using computational
methods. We found that a random walk process visits more
unique nodes and that the similarity strength between initial
and final nodes visited by the walk is weaker for walks over
the HSC network than the LSC network. These results were
robust to the starting node and the number of steps taken by
the walk. Thus, individual differences in thought processes
between LSC and HSC individuals can be produced by an
uncontrolled search process on differing semantic networks,
providing support for Mednick’s theory.
Notably, both networks have the same nodes, amount of
edges, and average degree (number of edges per node).
Thus, the differences between the random walks cannot be
due to the HSC individuals merely having more connections
in their semantic network. Rather, this reflects that HSC
individuals have connections that enable a random walk to
move quickly through the network. It is important to note
that this demonstrates sufficiency, but not necessity: It does
not rule out that different processes are being used by LSC
and HSC individuals. Regardless, by showing how
differences in representation can produce differences in
