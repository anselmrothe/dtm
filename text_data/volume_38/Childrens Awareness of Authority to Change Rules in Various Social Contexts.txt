   Second, we manipulated whether the rule was initiated by
an adult authority figure or by the children themselves.
Once again, based on prior work, children should be more
rigid when the rule comes from an adult authority figure.
   Third, we manipulated whether the rule was initiated by
one of the children (i.e. a “leader” and his/her “followers”)
or by all of the children through a collaborative agreement.
Since there was no adult authority, it is an open question
whether children would view the authority of the “leader”
child as enough to warrant permission to change the rules.
