Abstract
A growing body of research suggests that individuals with
developmental dyslexia perform below typical readers on
non-linguistic cognitive tasks involving the learning and
encoding of statistical-sequential patterns. However, the
neural mechanisms underlying such a deficit have not been
well examined. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the ERP correlates of sequence processing in a
sample of children diagnosed with dyslexia using a
probabilistic visual serial learning paradigm. The behavioral
results revealed that whereas age-matched typically
developing children (n=12) showed learning in the task as
reflected by their response times, the children with dyslexia
(n=8) likely showed difficulty in learning. In conjunction with
these behavioral results, the ERPs of the typically developing
children showed a P300-like response indicative of this
paradigm (Jost et al., 2015); whereas, the children diagnosed
with a reading disorder showed no such ERP effects. These
findings are consistent with the idea that differences in
statistical-sequential learning ability might underlie the
reading deficits observed in developmental dyslexia.

Introduction
Statistical-sequential learning refers to the ability to learn
statistically structured sequential patterns from the
environment (Lashley, 1951; Saffran, Aslan, Newport, 1996).
Statistical learning is thought to be important for the
acquisition of language. For instance, in spoken language,
linguistic units (e.g., phonemes, syllables, words) are
organized in statistically structured sequences according to
the specific language’s phonology, phonotactics, semantics,
and syntax. A growing body of research suggests that
variations in statistical learning ability are associated with
spoken language ability, in adults (Conway, Bauernschmidt,
Huang, & Pisoni, 2010; Misyak, Christiansen, & Tomblin,
2010), children (Kidd, 2012), and infants (Shafto, Conway,

396

Field, & Houston, 2012). Recent research also suggests that
this same relationship between statistical learning and spoken
language may hold true for statistical learning and written
language. For instance, visual statistical learning was found
to be related to reading ability in adults and children, even
after controlling for age and attention (Arciuli & Simpson,
2012). Similarly, performance on a variant of the serial
response time (SRT) task has also been shown to predict
reading ability in a sample that included both healthy controls
and adults diagnosed with dyslexia (Bennet, Romano,
Howard, & Howard, 2008).
Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a learning disability that
specifically impairs a person's ability to read despite
having normal intelligence and ample opportunity for
learning. Common characteristics among people with
dyslexia are difficulty with phonological processing (the
manipulation of sounds) (Bradley & Bryant, 1983;
Snowling, 2000) and spelling (NINDS, 2011; Gabrieli
2009). In the standard view of dyslexia, individuals present
with difficulty in reading but appear to process other
information in a typical manner. In recent decades,
however, it has become apparent that developmental
dyslexia may be associated with impairments to other
cognitive abilities such as motor functioning (Orban,
Lungu, & Doyon, 2008), implicit learning (Du & Kelly,
2013), and cerebellar dysfunction (Nicolson, Fawcett, &
Dean, 2001).
Of the many studies suggesting that there may be
broader cognitive impairments underlying developmental
dyslexia, a single commonality underlies many: sequential
learning ability. For instance, individuals with dyslexia
have been shown to perform below typical reading peers in
variations of the SRT and other related sequence learning
paradigms (Du & Kelley, 2013; Howard, Howard, Japiske,
& Eden, 2006; Jiminez-fernandez, 2011; Vicari, Marotta,
Menghini, Molinari, & Petrosini, 2003). Thus, there is
mounting behavioral evidence for dyslexia to be associated
with impairments in implicit statistical-sequential learning
mechanisms. However, the neural mechanisms associated

with this proposed learning deficit have not been well
explored. Furthermore, many of the previously mentioned
tasks involved a motor component to learning; as such it is
important to determine whether impaired sequential
learning is due solely to difficulties with motor learning or
whether deficits are also found using tasks that are not as
dependent upon motor responses.

The Current Study
The purpose of the current study was to examine the neural
correlates of statistical learning in children who have been
diagnosed with DD compared to age-matched, typicallyreading children. To this aim, we measured event-related
potentials (ERPs) while children were engaged in a visual
statistical learning paradigm previously used by Jost,
Conway, Purdy, Walk, and Hendricks (2015). Eight
children previously diagnosed with DD and twelve TD
children participated. The learning task involved the
presentation of a series of visual stimuli wherein target
stimuli could be probabilistically predicted based on the
preceding stimulus. ERPs to three different types of
predictor stimuli reflecting high, low and zero probability
of being followed by the target were compared across DD
and TD groups. Based on the Jost, Conway, Purdy, Walk
& Hendricks, (2015) study that demonstrated a P300-like
ERP component that was associated with learning in the
task, we investigated waveforms within the same 400700ms time-window as used by Jost et al., (2015). We also
examined behavioral correlates of learning as measured by
response times (RTs) to the target stimuli. We predicted
that if developmental dyslexia is associated with a deficit
to general-purpose statistical learning mechanisms, the
children with DD would be poorer at learning the
predictor-target statistical patterns, as reflected by both the
behavioral and ERP data, compared to the TD children.
Furthermore, because the ERP effects are time-locked to
the presentation of the predictor stimuli before any motor
responses are made, any observed differences in the
waveforms would suggest that the locus of impairment is
at a perceptual or cognitive level, rather than only at the
motor response level of processing.

or learning disorders (TD group). The TD group was
recruited through advertisements or by word of mouth and
the DD group was recruited through a flier placed in the
newsletter of a city school that specializes in teaching
children with learning disorders. All participants’ families
were compensated $30.00- $40.00 for a 2 hour testing
session and travel, and each child was given a small toy
($5.00-$10.00 in value). The resulting average age of the
children across groups was similar, though the DD group
[M=10.7] was slightly older than the TD [M=9.4] group on
average. [t(18)=-1.707, p=.105] (and are still similar when
one TD group participant was removed due to missing data
on the cognitive tests1). Table 1 shows the demographic
characteristics for the two groups.

Procedure
In addition to the statistical learning task (described
below), we administered 2 sub-tests from the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children IV (WISC) (Wechsler,
Kaplan, Fein, Kramer, Morris, Delis, & Maelender, 2003).
We assessed participants’ level of perceptual reasoning
using the Block Design (BD) subtest. This test assesses
visual-motor and visual-spatial skills by requiring children
to recreate a 2-dimensional printed figure using 3dimensional blocks, within a specific time frame. We also
used the Digit Span (DS) sub-test as an index of short-term
memory capacity as it provides a measure of a child’s
ability to retain new information, concentrate and
manipulate input, thus demonstrating cognitive flexibility.
The results of the BD and DS assessments are provided in
Table 2. As one can see, the two groups of children
obtained very similar scores, which were not statistically
significant from one another for either subtest [BD: t(17)=1.288, p=.215 and DS: t(17)=-1.259, p=.225].

Method
Participants
Twenty children (ages 8-12 years) were recruited from the
greater Saint Louis region, eight of whom had a prior
diagnosis of reading dyslexia (DD group) and the
remaining had no prior diagnoses of cognitive, emotional,

The resulting average age of the children across groups was
similar, though the DD group [M=10.7] was slightly older than
the TD [M=9.4] group on average. [t(17)=-1.678, p=.112]

The DD children were also administered the Pseudoword
decoding and Word Reading sub-tests of the Wechsler
Individual Achievement Test-II (WIAT) (Wechsler, 2005).
The Word Reading (WR) sub-test assesses basic
phonological skills and the Pseudoword Decoding (PD)
sub-test assesses the child’s ability to use phonetic
decoding skills while reading from a list of nonsense
words. The results of these two subtests are shown in Table
2. These scores indicate that the DD group performed at
least two standard deviations below age matched peers on
both WIAT sub-tests.

Statistical Learning Task
In the statistical learning task, children were presented with
consecutive series of colored circles on a computer monitor
one at a time (Figure 1). Stimuli were presented
electronically
using
E-Prime
2.0.8.90
software
(Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA), on a Dell
Optiplex 755 computer. Each visual stimulus was
presented in the center of the screen on top of a dark
background, displayed for 500ms Participants were
instructed to press a button on a button box each time a
target (T) color appeared. Every trial began with one to
five occurrences of a standard (S) stimulus in the center of
the screen. Following the presentation of these S stimuli,
one of three possible predictor stimuli appeared, with each
one predicting the target stimulus with varying levels of
probability. When a high predictor (HP) color appeared,
the target color followed 90% of the time; when a low
predictor (LP) color appeared, the target color followed
20% of the time. When T did not appear (10% of the time
for HP; 80% of the time for LP) the S followed instead. A
zero-predictor (ZP) color was never followed by T, but
always followed by S. The end of one trial was

immediately followed by the next trial. Each of the three
predictor colors occurred with the same frequency and the
assignment of colors (red, blue, green, brown, white) to the
three predictors, Ss, and Ts, was determined randomly for
each participant. Note that Figure 1 shows an example
depiction of the task with the HP being assigned to the red
stimulus, ZP to the blue stimulus, etc.
Each predictor condition (HP, ZP and LP) was presented
50 times. Within each block, the trials were presented
randomly and the end of one trial segued seamlessly into
the next trial, so that participants could not distinguish the
onset or offset of one trial from another. There were 50
trials of each predictor (for a total of 150 trials). Note that
participants were given no instruction of the predictortarget statistical contingencies. Instead, the participant was
expected to implicitly learn the statistical relationships
between each predictor and the target, with learning to be
expected to be observed through both response times and
ERPs (as per Jost et al., 2015).

then low-pass filtered at 30 Hz. The continuous EEG was
segmented into epochs -200ms to +1000ms with respect to

group [F(1, 28) = .086. p = .772] and the group x predictor
interaction were non-significant [F(1, 28) = 1.03. p = .319].
Even though the predictor X group interaction was nonsignificant (likely due to lack of statistical power), visually,
it appears that RTs were quite different for the TD and DD
groups, with the TD group showing the expected
facilitation in RTs for the HP compared to the LP
predictors, but the DD group not showing this same effect.
This could indicate that for the DD children, the subtle
differences between the HP/ LP were left undetected.
However, a larger sample size is needed before making
strong claims.
Figure 4 (left panel) displays grand average ERPs for the
DD participants, within the 400-700ms range. Visual
inspection indicates that the waveforms for the HP and LP
predictors have the same amplitude but are larger than the
ZP predictor. Figure 4 (right panel) displays grand average
ERPs for the TD participants for each predictor condition,
within the 400-700ms (across all 9 ROIs). Visual
inspection indicates that the waveform for the HP predictor
has a larger amplitude compared to the ZP and LP
predictor waveforms.
Two one–way ANOVAs were performed separately for
each group (DD, TD) within the 400-700ms window with
EEG amplitude as the dependent variable and predictor
conditions (HP, ZP and LP) as the independent variables.
In the DD group, there were significant differences among
predictor conditions [F(2, 1941) = 24.762, p<.001].
However, Tukey’s post hoc-tests indicated that there were
no significant differences between the HP and LP groups
(p=.865) but there were significant differences between HP
and ZP (p<.001) and LP and ZP (p<.001). Analyses for the
TD group revealed that there were significant differences
between the predictor conditions [F(2, 2913) = 4.325,
p=.02]. Tukey’s post hoc tests indicated significant
differences between the HP and LP (p=.01), and HP and
ZP (p<.05) but not between the ZP and LP groups
(p=.918).

Statistical Analysis
Statistical calculations were performed on the individual
mean amplitude ERPs within 400-700ms (as used by Jost
et al, 2015). To analyze the effect of cortical topography,
nine regions of interest (ROIs, Figure 2) were defined: left
(LAn), middle (FRz), and right anterior (RAn); left (LCn),
middle (CNz), and right central (RCn); and left (LPo),
middle (POz), and right posterior (RPo) regions.
Behavioral analyses were conducted across DD and TD
groups for response times. Pearson correlations were also
performed on both groups with the WISC sub-tests as well
as with the DD group and the WIAT sub-tests.

Results
RT data (Figure 3) was examined for only 10 TD children
and on 6 of the DD children (due to missing data for 2
children in both groups). A 2 X 2 ANOVA with 2 levels of
predictor (HP/ LP) and 2 groups (TD/DD) with RT as
dependent variable revealed a significant main effect for
predictor only [F(1, 28) = 24.018. p < .001]. The effect for

missing data (N=19) indicated that scores on the Digit span
(DS) sub-test were strongly correlated with scores on the
Block design (BD) sub-test [r(17)=.543; p=.02]. Pearson
correlation analyses for only the DD group (N=8) children
showed that scores on the Pseudoword Decoding (PD) subtest were strongly correlated with scores on the Word
Reading (WR) sub-test of the WIAT [r(6)=.967; p<.001].
Additionally, non-significant correlations were observed
between: WR and statistical learning: [r(6)=.375, p = .360]
and PD and statistical learning: [r(6)=.520, p = .186]. The
lack of significant correlations is largely due to a small
sample size issue.

not learned the subtle distinction in terms of the predictortarget probabilities that differentiate the HP from the LP
stimulus (in terms of predicting the target with a 90% vs.
20% probability). This pattern of performance is also
reflected in their RTs, by not responding faster to targets
following the HP stimulus. Thus, it would appear that the
children with developmental dyslexia were unable to learn
even the most basic of statistical-sequential dependencies
contained within this visual input stream.
How do the current findings relate to some of the
prominent theories about the causes of developmental
dyslexia, namely the phonological deficit and
magnocellular deficit theories? The phonological deficit
explanation is a prominent theory suggesting that dyslexia
is a language-based disorder characterized by difficulties in
single-word decoding (Orton, 1995) and phonological
processing (Snowling, 2000). According to this theory,
these individuals experience difficulties in perceiving and
parsing phonemes, resulting in the inability to establish
phoneme-grapheme connections. Although prominent, this
theory does not explain other low-level visual, sensory, and
motor coordination deficits that have also been associated
with dyslexia. These shortcomings can instead be
accounted for by the magnocellular deficit theory (Eden,
Van- Meter, Rumsey, & Zeffiro, 1996). This theory
postulates weaknesses in the perception of visual, rapid
moving stimuli. Such degraded visual input is due to poor
binocular fixation while reading. Its physiological
manifestation is at the central nervous system level with
impaired sensitivity of cells within the retinocortical
magnocellular pathway (Stein, 2001). In the context of the
present findings, the magnocellular theory would seem to
be most relevant as it might help account for difficulties
the DD children encountered while performing the visual
statistical learning task. Future work will need to explore
the specificity of this statistical learning deficit, that is, to
what extent is it also apparent for other statistical learning
tasks such as those incorporating auditory (non-linguistic)
input streams or even visual-spatial patterns.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that children with
DD show difficulty in implicitly learning statisticalsequential visual patterns. Because learning was indexed at
the perceptual level by ERPs, and was not dependent upon
a motor response, it appears that the learning deficit is not
based on motor learning but reflects a more perceptual or
cognitive learning problem. Additional research is required
at both cognitive and neurophysiological levels in order to
clarify the nature of this impairment and how it relates to
or causes reading disability.

Discussion
In this study, we examined the neural correlates of visual
statistical-sequential learning in children who have been
diagnosed with a reading disorder. The results showed
that: (1) Relative to the TD group, typical learning patterns
in RT data from children diagnosed with DD seemed less
apparent, indicating unlikely encoding of the predictortarget relationships; and (2) the DD group showed atypical
ERP waveforms within the 400-700ms time-window,
compared to TD controls.
In a previous study using this same visual paradigm with
a group of TD children, Jost et al. (2015) observed a P300like component elicited by the HP but not the LP or ZP
stimuli, similar to what we observed in the current sample
of TD children. The P300 is regarded as an index of target
detection and evaluation (van suijen et al., 2006) and has
also been observed in other learning tasks (Baldwin &
Kutas, 1997; Carrion & Bly, 2007; Russeler et al., 2003).
Jost et al. (2015) suggested that the P300, typically
observed during the occurrence of an infrequent target
stimulus, “shifted” earlier in the input stream so that it now
occurred in response to a stimulus that predicted the target
with a high level of probability. That is, after sufficient
exposure to the sequential statistics of the input array, the
participants’ brains treated the high predictor stimulus as if
it were the target itself, displaying the prototypical P300
response. Regardless of the actual cognitive interpretation
of the P300, it is clear that it reflects the participants
treating the high predictor stimulus differently than both
the low and zero predictor stimuli, presumably on the basis
of having learned that this stimulus predicts the target with
a high level of reliability.
In contrast, the DD group showed both a lack of
facilitation of reaction times and an atypical ERP
waveform pattern. Rather than showing the P300 effect to
the HP stimulus, the DD group showed it for both the HP
and the LP stimuli. This suggests that these children were
unlikely to have encoded the statistical probabilities
between predictors and target. Rather than learning that the
HP stimulus was “special” in terms of its predictive power,
it appears that these children learned that both the HP and
LP were predictive of the target. On this account, they have
