   The advice in the risky advice group was “I would
recommend 'Alternative 1'. The returns for 'Alternative 1' are,
in the long-run, greater than 'Alternative 2.' Although you
may occasionally lose money in the short run, 'Alternative 1'
offers the best long-run prospect for future returns”, while in
the conservative advice group the advice is “I would
recommend 'Alternative 2'. You may not make huge jumps in
earnings as in 'Alternative 1', but you don’t lose large
amounts of money and it gives you a secure payoff if you
keep choosing it”. Here ‘Alternative 1’ and ‘Alternative 2’
refer to the risky or safe option, respectively, which were
randomized in location across participants.

                        Experiment 2
In Experiment 1, we showed that advisors enable people to
take more risks irrespective of the quality of the advice. In
Experiment 2, we manipulate advisor trust by manipulating
the phrasing of the advice.

kick in. This underlines the importance of trust in terms of
boosting risk taking and demonstrates the third assumption of
the money doctors model.
