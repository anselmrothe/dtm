estimate the transitions associated with each TS separately
to allow for participant bias such that they prefer to choose
one TS over the other without any evidence.
   Simpler models are possible by fixing some of the
parameters. We contrast the bias-2 observer to three related
models: one where the transition matrix is forced to be
symmetric (bias-1), an optimal observer where the transition
matrix is fixed based on the training run (optimal), and a
base-rate neglect model with a fixed transition matrix as
defined above (base-rate neglect).
