In the base-rate condition, the robots that comprised the

Predictions In both problems, the normatively correct
answer is to produce a response that aligns with the base-
rates (and in the no-conflict problems, this also corresponds
with a response from individuating information). In no-
conflict problems, children should provide the response
consistent with both the base-rate and individuating
information, as these will point to the same response. In
conflict problems, if children are biased toward using

examine the development of base-rate neglect. For example,
ongoing work in our lab is investigating a second important
feature of the adult work on representativeness that has
been, to our knowledge, untested in children. That is, of
course in many cases, it is reasonable (and highly
computationally efficient) to rely on the type of
individuating information that is provided in these vignettes,
as the information appears to be accurate and reliable.
However, adults will neglect base-rates in favor of
individuating information even when that individuating
information is presented as unreliable or uninformative for
classification. This suggests that adults have an
overwhelming expectation that social information should
