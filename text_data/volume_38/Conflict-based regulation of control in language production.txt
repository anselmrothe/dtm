software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA).
Stimuli were displayed at the center of a 15 x 12 inch Dell
monitor approximately 25 inches in front of the participants.
Response times (RTs) for PWI were registered using an
Audio-Technica microphone connected to the E-Prime’s
SRBOX. Responses were also recorded digitally and
transcribed offline for the identification of errors. RTs for the
PP were registered using a Dell keyboard.

   Additionally, we found no correlation between the size of
conflict adaptation in PWI and PP at the level of individuals.
This could imply that the two tasks indeed use different
regulatory mechanisms, but could also reflect the problems
associated with using the correlational method. Internal
consistency is known to be low for effects calculated as
subtractions (e.g. Redick et al., 2013), and when internal
consistency of measures is low (as was the case here),
correlations between measures are unreliable. Exp. 2
addressed this problem by directly manipulating cross-task
