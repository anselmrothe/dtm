child participants completed a feature-rating task for each

participants from each age group completed a spatial

Participants One hundred adults (mean age = 19.2 years)
participated in the experiment through a self-paced online
interface in return for course credit. Fifty participants
provided feature ratings for a set of containment (N=25, 14
males) or support items (N=25, 12 males). The other 50
participants provided descriptions for the same containment
