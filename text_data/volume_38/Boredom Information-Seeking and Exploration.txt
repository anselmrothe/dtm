Task Participants were asked to predict numbers generated
by a virtual machine (for a similar design, see Nassar et
al.2010). On each trial, they made their predictions by
adjusting a vertical slider (the "prediction slider", see fig
1A) between 0 and 100 to indicate the next value that the
virtual machine would generate. After they adjusted the
slider, they pressed the space key to confirm their
prediction, and the machine generated the number for that

that can be learned from a task is linked to how boring the
task is perceived: the Certain condition – i.e., the one in
which there was no useful information to be learned by
performing the task, because all the information was already
given to participants – elicited the highest boredom ratings

was possible to improve predictions by learning the
underlying number-generating distribution, was rated as the
least boring. This is consistent with previous theories on           Figure 2: A. Variant of the Experiment 1 task. Participants
