                            Introduction Taro was driving. His car broke down in a small town.
                              (First half) He decided to get a haircut while the car was being repaired.
                            Introduction There are only two barbershops in the town: Alf's shop and Bally's shop.
                          (Second half) They like each other.
                                            Alf's shop is on the ground floor of a building located in the east area of town.
                                     Filler In the building, there is a stationary shop.
                                  (Place) Bally's shop is along a street running in the west area of town.
                                            There is a supermarket near it.
                                            Alf's hair is unkept, and the nape of his neck is messy.
                               Key Fact Bally's hair is beautifully cut, and the nape of his neck is neat.
                                            Alf's shop is open until late.
                                     Filler He often eats dinner at his favorite restaurant near the shop.
                                   (Time) Bally's shop is open early.
                                            He usually walks with his friend around the shop in the morning.
                                  Ending Then, Taro selected Alf's shop.
