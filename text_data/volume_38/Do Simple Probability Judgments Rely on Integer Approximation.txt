the total number of marbles for both distributions. Since
ANS estimates are inexact, even for those who have with
high number sense acuity, an error in any one of these
estimates could lead to an incorrect judgment. For this
reason it is necessary to understand the computations that
lead to accurate performance as well as the strategies that
people may adopt when reasoning about the probability of
discrete binary outcomes.
       Models of Probability Discrimination
   Several studies investigating the approximate number
sense (Halberda & Feigenson, 2008; Pica et al. 2004) have
used computational models based on signal detection theory
in the psychophysical literature (Green & Swets, 1966).
The psychophysics model assumes that participants’
approximations form a Gaussian distribution on a mental
number line around a mean close to the actual number of
objects being estimated and a standard deviation given by
the participants’ number sense acuity, or Weber fraction,
multiplied by the mean. When presented with two groups
of objects and asked which has more the participants’
estimates form two Gaussian distributions which overlap
based on the distance between their means and the size of
their standard deviations. The area of overlap can be
thought of as the probability of a subject making an error,
which can be modeled using the psychophysical function
based on the CDF of the Gaussian distribution:
                    '( )'*                .      '( )'*
