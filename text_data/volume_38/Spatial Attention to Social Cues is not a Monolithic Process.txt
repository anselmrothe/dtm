   We began this investigation by using a standard spatial
cueing paradigm to examine differences in the speed of
detecting and responding to a peripheral target after the
appearance of a non-predictive pointing hand or arrow cue.
It has been argued that hands provide a more salient and
accurate cue than eye gaze or head direction, but have
received significantly less study (Langton et al., 2000;
Ricciardelli, Bricolo, Aglioti, & Chelazzi, 2002). In line
with previous research, we expected faster encoding and
thus shorter reaction times in response to a pointing hand as
compared to an arrow. Moreover, both types of stimuli have
been shown to be effective cues, so we do not expect any
difference in their cueing strength, measured as a validity
effect (invalid – valid RTs).
