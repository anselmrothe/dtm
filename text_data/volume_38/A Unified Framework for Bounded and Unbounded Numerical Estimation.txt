Abstract

estimate numbers on a log scale on a 0-1000 number line
(Siegler & Opfer, 2003). That logarithmic-to-linear
transitions appear at different times in development suggests
that logarithmic and linear representations can co-exist and
compete in the same child. Thus, a simple model of
numerical estimation is thought to be a mixed log-linear
model (MLLM), in which estimates are predicted as a
weighted sum of logarithmic and linear transforms of the
number to be estimated (Anobile et al., 2012; Opfer et al.,
2016)
Recently, two related challenges to the logarithmic-tolinear shift theory have been raised. The first challenge
argued that children's estimates reflect one of three
proportional reasoning strategies (Barth & Paladino, 2011;
Cohen & Blanc-Goldhammer, 2011; Cohen & Sarnecka,
2014; Slusser, Santiago, & Barth, 2013), which had been
modeled in adults using three different cyclic power models
(Hollands & Dyre, 2000). By comparing multiple
extensions of the cyclic power model (CPM) to a log or
linear model, Slusser et al. (2013) showed that one of the
power models showed better fits for a majority of 5- to 10year-olds‚Äô estimates than did the logarithmic model.
However, a recent study by Opfer and colleagues (2016)
provided evidence against this account, showing that the fit
of the cyclic power models was an artifact of an unusual
anchoring procedure used by Slusser et al. (2013) that did
not characterize estimates using the standard "free"
numerical estimation procedure. Further, Opfer et al. (2016)
found that both free and anchored estimates were better fit
by MLLM than a mixed cyclic power model (MCPM) that
included all variants of the CPMs proposed. Within this
MLLM, the effect of anchoring could be traced to
decreasing the logarithmicity of estimates without any need

Representations of numerical value have been assessed using
bounded (e.g., 0-1000) and unbounded (e.g., 0-?) number-line
tasks, with considerable debate regarding whether one or both
tasks elicit unique cognitive strategies (e.g., addition or
subtraction) and require unique cognitive models. To test this,
we examined 86 5- to 9-year-olds' addition, subtraction, and
estimation skill (bounded and unbounded). Against the
measurement-skills hypothesis, estimates were even more
logarithmic on unbounded than bounded number lines and
were better described by conventional log-linear models than
by alternative cognitive models. Moreover, logarithmic index
values reliably predicted arithmetic scores, whereas model
parameters of alternative models failed to do so. Results
suggest that the logarithmic-to-linear shift theory provides a
unified framework for numerical estimation with high
descriptive adequacy and yields uniquely accurate predictions
for children‚Äôs early math proficiency.

Introduction
In this paper, we sought to resolve a debate on what gives
rise to developmental changes in numerical estimation and
provide a unified framework for understanding seemingly
irreconcilable data regarding the psychophysical functions
that link numbers to their magnitude estimates (Barth &
Paladino, 2011; Cohen & Sarnecka, 2014; Opfer,
Thompson, & Kim, 2016; Siegler & Opfer, 2003; Slusser,
Santiago, & Barth, 2013).
Conventionally, developmental changes in numerical
estimation have been viewed as following a logarithmic-tolinear shift in representations of numeric magnitude (Siegler
& Opfer, 2003; Siegler, Thompson, & Opfer, 2009). This
shift was first observed on a number-line task, in which a
target number was estimated on a line flanked by a number
at each end (Fig. 1A). On this task, young children's
placement of numbers typically follows an approximately
logarithmic function (Siegler & Booth, 2004; Siegler &
Opfer, 2003; Opfer & Siegler, 2007; Opfer, Siegler, &
Young, 2011; Thompson & Opfer, 2008), but this
logarithmic pattern changes to a linear one later with age
and experience, with timing depending on the number
ranges tested (Siegler, Thompson, & Opfer, 2009). For
example, on a 0-100 number line, where estimates of
kindergarteners are logarithmic, second graders produce
linear estimates (Booth & Siegler, 2006), while they

for positing unique estimation strategies.
A second challenge to the logarithmic-to-linear shift
account was the measurement-skills account proposed by
Cohen and colleagues (2011, 2014). Here, log-like patterns
in estimates are proposed to arise because conventional
number-line tasks are "bounded" by two numbers, thereby
requiring sophisticated arithmetic skills, like subtraction,
which young children may not have acquired (Fig. 1A). In
this account, when a target number such as 70 is given on a
0-100 number line, a participant may need to consider both
the number 70 and the difference 30 after subtracting 70
from 100. In contrast, estimation of numbers on a number
line "unbounded" by the larger endpoint is thought to
require only addition (Fig. 1B), is thought to more
accurately reveal numeric magnitude judgments, and is
thought to be best modeled using three more variants of
power models called ‚Äúscallop power models‚Äù (SPM) (Cohen
& Blanc-Goldhammer, 2011).
To test this second challenge, Cohen and Sarnecka (2014)
tested the effects of boundedness in number-line tasks by
giving both bounded and unbounded tasks to 3- to 8-yearolds. Model fits of a log or linear function were compared to
those of multiple variations of the CPM for the bounded
estimates and to those of multiple SPMs for the unbounded
estimates. In the bounded condition, the extensions of cyclic
models provided better fits to estimates, and the response
bias parameters (Œ≤s) changed with age. For the unbounded
number-line estimates, in contrast, one of three scallop
power models predicted the estimates better, but the
estimation bias parameters (Œ≤s) stayed constant across age
groups. These findings led the researchers to conclude that
there were no such things as log-to-linear shifts in numerical
representation, but these changes stemmed from the poor
use of arithmetic strategies. Also, they suggested that
numerical estimation be made on an unbounded number line
for a better assessment of number representations.

anchor their estimates will result in improved performance,
leading to bounded numerical estimates being more accurate
and more linear than unbounded estimates.
To test these hypotheses, we nearly replicated the
procedure used by Cohen and Sarnecka (2014) with the only
exception being to use a fully-balanced design that could
detect order effects and the administration of a battery of
math tests (addition and subtraction). Then, we pit the
MLLM tested by Opfer et al. (2016) against the MCPMs for
bounded number-line tasks and against the mixed scallop
power model (MSPM) for unbounded number-line tasks.
The MLLM consists of logarithmic and linear
components and is defined as:
ùëà
ùë¶= ùëé ùúÜ
ln ùë• + 1 ‚àí ùúÜ ùë• ,
(1)
ln ùëà
in which y indicates an estimate of number x on a 0-U
number line. Also, a denotes a scaling parameter, and Œª is a
logarithmicity index that measures the degrees of
logarithmic compression in estimates. If estimation is
perfectly linear, a Œª value converges to 0, whereas the
value of the logarithmicity index gets close to 1 as
estimation shows more logarithmic compression.
The MCPMs were formulated as proposed by Hollands
and Dyre (2000) (also see Opfer, Thompson, & Kim, 2016,
for details). The first MCPM (MCPM1) is formalized based
on Slusser et al. (2013)‚Äôs study that hypothesized that the
number of reference points used for estimation changes in
development: children with poor proportion skills would
only use a single reference point, i.e., the lower bound, (0
cyclic power model), and then learn to use the lower and
upper bounds (1 cycle power model) and the middle point
with the two endpoints (2 cycle power model) as they
become more familiar with the number range. The MCPM1
is defined as:
ùë¶ = ùë§! ‚àô 0CPM + ùë§! ‚àô 1CPM + ùë§! ‚àô 2CPM,

(2)

where each of w1, w2, and w3 denotes a weight for each
variant of the CPM respectively. Each weight and the sum
of weights are constrained to be between 0 and 1, so that
contribution of three models in a response can be assessed
individually. The MCPM2 is identical to the MCPM1
except that 0CPM is replaced with the subtraction bias
cyclic model (SBCM) in the MCPM2 as proposed by Cohen
& Sarnecka (2014). The SBCM was similar to 1CPM, but
includes an additional parameter (s) that is associated with
the subtraction bias.
The MSPM for unbounded number-line tasks is also
formed in the same manner based on Cohen and BlancGoldhammer (2011)‚Äôs assumption that the unbounded tasks
are solved using an addition strategy. The following is the
formalization of the mixed model:
ùë¶ = ùë§! ‚àô 1SPM + ùë§! ‚àô 2SPM + ùë§! ‚àô MSPM.
(3)
In the model, 1SPM indicates the single scallop model,
2SPM the dual scallop model, and MSPM the multiple
scallop model. The same constraints set on weights in the
mixed CPM are set in this model.

The Current Study
In this paper, we tested three rival hypotheses regarding
bounded and unbounded numerical estimation. The primary
hypothesis is that the cognitive process of estimation in the
two tasks is essentially similar and does not require positing
six estimation strategies associated with six unique
psychophysical functions. From this perspective, bounded
and unbounded numerical estimates -- like free and
anchored numerical estimates -- are best viewed as
reflecting children's representations of numeric magnitude
and best modeled using the same mixed log-linear model.
The second hypothesis is that both tasks are equally well
suited for characterizing numerical magnitude estimates,
with the parameters of the MLLM derived from each task
providing better predictors of children's use of numbers in
other contexts (such as addition and subtraction) than even
the models that allegedly track addition and subtraction
skill. Finally, because number-line estimation tasks do
assess children's representations of numeric magnitude,
providing children with more numbers against which to

753

After obtaining model fits and parameter estimates from
each of the models, we next compared fits of the MLLM
with the MCPMs for the bounded condition and with the
MSPM for the unbounded condition to examine the bestfitting model for each number-line task. Whereas the
alternative functions are task-specific, the MLLM is
theoretically applicable to both bounded and unbounded
conditions. Therefore, if the MLLM is an unifying,
generalizable
function
that
captures
numerical
representations regardless of number-line boundedness, the
MLLM should not only describe the bounded estimates
better (Opfer et al., 2016), but also predict data from the
unbounded condition better. Also, we examined whether
model parameters, such as subtraction bias (s) in the
MCPM2 and logarithmicity (Œª) in the MLLM, actually
predict addition and subtraction accuracy. If compressive
estimates appear due to a lack of subtraction skills in the
bounded number-line tasks, significant correlation between
subtraction bias (s) and actual subtraction performance
should be observed. On the other hand, if compression in
estimates reflects logarithmic representations of
numbers, the logarithmicity index (Œª) should predict
both addition and subtraction achievement better than
other arithmetic-strategy or estimation bias parameters.

instruction that was created based on Cohen and Sarnecka
(2014):
Now we're going to play a game with numbers. This is a
number line. In this game, each number line will have a 0
here and 1 over here. All the other numbers go after 1. There
will be a number up here. Your job is to show me where that
number goes on a number line like this one. When you
decide where the number goes, you have to drag this little
mark to where the number should go. When you're ready to
go again, press the green bar on the keyboard.

The length between 0 and 1 was adjusted based on the
ranges of number lines. In other words, a displayed length
for 0-1 intervals was the shortest for a 0-1000 number line,
whereas it was the longest in the 0-30 number line task.
Based on Slusser et al. (2013), different number ranges
that would elicit compressive estimates were used
depending on children‚Äôs grades. 5- and 6-year-old
kindergarteners were given 0-30 number-line tasks with tobe-estimated numbers sampled evenly from a 0-30 range: 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27,
28, 29, 30. For first graders, a 0-100 number line was used
with 25 numbers between 0 and 100: 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 17, 21,
23, 25, 29, 33, 39, 43, 48, 52, 57, 61, 64, 72, 29, 81, 84, 90,
96, 100. Second graders were asked to estimate numbers
chosen between 0 and 1000 on a 0-1000 number line: 2, 5,
18, 34, 56, 78, 100, 122, 147, 150, 163, 179, 246, 366, 486,
606, 722, 725, 738, 754, 818, 938, 1000. In both bounded
and unbounded conditions, the same target numbers were
randomly presented. To keep children‚Äôs attention on the
tasks, a neutral sound was produced once a stimulus was
displayed or a response was made by mouse click. The tasks
started after an instruction without any practice, and there
was no feedback provided over trials.
Upon completion of the two number-line tasks, arithmetic
performance was assessed with paper-and-pencil addition
and subtraction tests. The addition test consisted of 50 onedigit addend problems, such as 1+1 and 5+3. The
subtraction items were generated by rearranging the
addition. To be specific, the first addends in the addition test
were used as subtrahends, while the second addends became
the answers. For the questions like 1+1 = 2 and 5+3 = 8,
they were rearranged to be 2-1 and 8-5 in the subtraction.
Participants were given the tests in a random order and
asked to solve as many problems as they could within 1
minute for each test.

Experiment
Methods
Subject Thirty 5- to 6-year-old kindergarten, 30 first grade,
and 26 second grade students were recruited in Columbus,
OH (kindergarteners: 17 female children, M = 5.90 years,
SD = .32 years; first graders: 19 female children, M = 6.74
years, SD = .39 years; second graders: 21 female children,
M = 7.91 years, SD = .46 years).
Materials and Procedure Participants completed both
bounded and unbounded number-line tasks given in a
counterbalanced order. In the bounded condition, a number
was shown for 2,000 ms above a number line flanked by 0
and 30/100/1000 (Fig. 1A). On every trial, the mouse cursor
was reset to be located at the 0 point and moved only
horizontally on a number line. Participants were instructed
to estimate a given number on a number line with the
following instruction:
Now we're going to play a game with numbers. This is a
number line. In this game, each number line will have a 0 at
one end and 30/100/1000 at the other end. There will be a
number up here. Your job is to show me where that number
goes on a number line like this one. When you decide where
the number goes, you have to drag this little mark to where
the number should go. When you're ready to go again, press
the green bar (spacebar with a green sticker on) on the
keyboard.

Results
Whether cognitive process of estimation is qualitatively
different between bounded and unbounded tasks was
examined using psychophysical functions. For the bounded
condition, individual data were fit by the MLLM, MCPM1,
and MCPM2, whereas estimates on unbounded number
lines were fit with the MLLM and MSPM. The model fits
were then assessed by comparing AICc values.
Against the measurement-skills account, none of the
MCPMs was the best fitting model for bounded number-line
estimation. For 0-30 and 0-100 number-line estimates, most

The unbounded number-line task was identical to the
bounded one except that a single-unit line (0-1) was
presented instead of the full range number line (Fig. 1B). An
experimenter introduced the task with the following

children‚Äôs performance was better explained by the MLLM
(Table 1). Estimates of 50% of participants on 0-1000
number lines were also best fit by the MLLM. In the
unbounded condition, across all the three number ranges,
100% of children produced estimates that were better
described by the MLLM than the MSPM. The results
suggest that logarithmically distorted estimates in a numberline task do not stem from a lack of proportion, subtraction,
or addition skills, but come from representations of
numerical magnitude that are well predicted with the mixed
log-linear model.
Would variants of the power models based on arithmetic
strategies predict children‚Äôs actual arithmetic performance?
To address this question, we next correlated each child‚Äôs
addition and subtraction performance with the best-fitting
parameter values from the models. If response patterns in
the bounded condition came from poor subtraction skills,
parameters, such as Œ≤s of the MCPM1 & MCPM2 and s of
MCPM2, would be expected to correlate with arithmetic
scores. As presented in Table 2, however, none of the Œ≤s
from the MCPMs was a reliable predictor for either addition
or subtraction scores: only Œ≤1CPM of MCPM1 correlated with
subtraction scores, but such correlation was not found in the
subtraction bias parameter s of MCPM2. This correlation
also remained insignificant if adjusted parameter values
(absolute values of Œ≤-1 or s-1) were used for analyses. In
contrast, the logarithmicity parameter Œª of the MLLM
reliably predicted both addition and subtraction
performance, r(84) = -.42, p < .001 for addition; r(84) = .36, p < .01 for subtraction. The finding suggests that the
more logarithmic their estimates were in bounded tasks, the
worse performance in arithmetic tests was observed.
We also examined relations between the parameter Œ≤s
of the MSPM and arithmetic achievement in the unbounded
tasks. According to the measurement-skills account, these
parameters in the scallop models should reflect
representation of numeric magnitude most accurately of all
because the task is supposedly pure of the sins of
boundedness and the model is correct. Against this idea,
however, none of the parameter Œ≤s were significantly
correlated with arithmetic performance, whereas the MLLM
parameter Œª again showed a significant correlation with
addition and subtraction, r(84) = -.33, p < .01 for addition;
r(84) = -.34, p < .01 for subtraction (Table 2). These
findings again support the idea that logarithmic estimates on
a number line should be viewed as a reflection of
logarithmic representation of numbers, which interferes with
use of numbers in other contexts.

The final issue we examined was to quantify the effect of
boundedness on numerical estimation. If the bounded
number-line tasks required more challenging measurement
skill, the bounded tasks would be expected to elicit more
erroneous and compressive estimates. On the other hand, if
the two endpoints provide better anchors against which to
judge large numbers, estimates in the bounded condition
would be expected to yield less logarithmic and more
accurate estimates. Consistent with the latter account, on all
the 0-30/100/1000 number-line tasks, percent absolute
errors (PAE) in median estimates were always greater in the
unbounded than bounded conditions (bounded M = 12%, SD
= 5%, unbounded M = 17%, SD = 7% for 0-30 range;
bounded M = 12%, SD = 4%, unbounded M = 14%, SD =
7%, for 0-100 range; bounded M = 20%, SD = 12%,
unbounded M = 24%, SD = 14%, for 0-1000 range).
Additionally, as shown in Figure 2A, in all the three
number ranges, the values of the logarithmicity parameter
(Œª) were greater for median estimates in the unbounded
condition than those in the bounded condition (bounded Œª =
.30, unbounded Œª = .76 for 0-30 range; bounded Œª = .42,
unbounded Œª = .55 for 0-100 range; bounded Œª = .73,
unbounded Œª = .75 for 0-1000 range). These results do not
support the measurement-skills prediction that unbounded
number-line tasks are easier and require less advanced
mensuration skills than conventional bounded tasks.
Finally, the same analyses were repeated on individual
children's data. For the 0-30 number-lines, greater PAEs
were again observed in the unbounded than bounded
condition (M = 17%, SD = 7% for bounded; M = 21%, SD =
7% for unbounded), t(29) = 3.82, p < .001. For the 0-100
number-lines, greater PAEs were also observed in the
unbounded than bounded condition (M = 15%, SD = 7% for
Table 2. Correlation between parameter values and
arithmetic performance after number-line ranges were
controlled for.

bounded; M = 19%, SD = 9% for unbounded), t(29) = 3.51,
p < .01. And for 0-1000 number-lines, greater PAEs were
again observed in the unbounded than bounded condition
(M = 20%, SD = 8% for bounded; M = 27%, SD = 11% for
unbounded), t(25) = 5.21, p < .001. Therefore, for all the
three number ranges, conventional number lines with two
bounds elicited more accurate responses than unbounded
number lines. These results are not at all consistent with the
measurement-skills account.
Although number-line tasks without an upper bound
produced more erroneous estimates, it is not clear whether
the unboundedness increased random noise or logarithmic
compression in estimates. To address this issue, individual
children‚Äôs degrees of logarithmicity were obtained with the
MLLM fitting.
As shown in Figure 2B, in all the three number ranges,
the values of the logarithmicity measure were greater for a
number line without bounds. In 0-30 and 0-100 number-line
tasks, estimates in the unbounded condition showed
significantly greater logarithmic compression in the 0-30
range (M = .51, SD = .38 for bounded; M = .76, SD = .31 for
unbounded), t(29) = 4.33, p < .001, and in the 0-100 range
(M = .51, SD = .31 for bounded; M = .65, SD = .30 for
unbounded), t(29) = 3.37, p < .01. Although logarithmicity
was slightly greater for the unbounded 0-1000 number-line
task than for the bounded one, the difference was not
statistically significant (M = .70, SD = .32 for bounded; M
= .74, SD = .32 for unbounded), p > .05. Against the
arithmetic strategy hypothesis, negatively accelerating
patterns in estimates were observed in both bounded and
unbounded number-line tasks, and these patterns were
stronger when the number line did not have a right-end
bound. Even if the number-line task without the right
endpoint revealed more accurate representation of numbers
as the measurement-skills account claimed, what it revealed
in the unbounded task was more logarithmic compression.

data regarding the psychophysical functions that link
numbers to their magnitude estimates (Barth & Paladino,
2011; Cohen & Sarnecka, 2014; Opfer, Thompson, & Kim,
2016; Siegler & Opfer, 2003; Slusser, Santiago, & Barth,
2013). Specifically, we wished to see whether the
logarithmic-to-linear shift existed on both bounded and
unbounded number lines. As Cohen and Sarnecka (2014)
stated, ‚ÄúFor those children whose data are best fit by the
logarithmic function, we are skeptical that this reflects a
logarithmically organized quantity representation. If it did,
we should expect to see the same pattern on the unbounded
task‚Ä¶.‚Äù (p. 1650).
In the teeth of this skepticism, we found robust evidence
for a logarithmically organized quantity representation on
the unbounded task, as well as the bounded task. Evidence
came from multiple sources. First, the MLLM‚Äîwhich had
previously unified discrepant data from free and anchored
numerical estimation (Opfer et al., 2016)‚Äîpredicted data
from bounded and unbounded tasks better than rival
psychophysical models. Additionally, for both tasks, the
logarithmicity parameter was significantly greater than zero
in each of the three age groups tested. This success of a
single simple model over many competing complex models
suggests there may be a simple cognitive process lurking
behind many varieties of numerical estimation.
Second, individual differences were stable across the two
tasks: children whose estimates were most logarithmic in
the bounded task were also most logarithmic patterns in the
unbounded task, r(84) = .73, p < .001. This wouldn't be
expected if the two tasks elicited radically different
estimation strategies or if only one of the tasks provided an
accurate picture of children's numeric magnitude judgments.
Third, although the two tasks differed in overall accuracy,
it was not in the direction predicted by the measurementskills account: PAEs and logarithmicity values of both
median and individuals‚Äô estimates were always greater for
the unbounded condition across all three number ranges.
Therefore, even if the more difficult unbounded tasks
provide a better picture of the internal mental number line,
what they show is stronger evidence for logarithmic
representation of numbers.

Discussion
In this paper, we attempted to address the nature of
developmental changes in numerical estimation and to
provide a unified framework for seemingly irreconcilable

Finally, the parameters expected by the measurementskills account to track arithmetic biases unique to each task
never predicted actual arithmetic performance, calling into
question the psychological meaning of these parameters
(Table 2). In contrast, the logarithmicity component of the
MLLM reliably predicted children's arithmetic proficiency
regardless of whether bounded or unbounded number lines
were used, which is wholly inconsistent with the idea that
bounded number lines require greater arithmetic skills than
unbounded ones.
Why might our results have differed so strongly from
those of Cohen and colleagues (2011, 2014)? Two
reasons‚Äîmethodological and analytical‚Äîseem likely. First,
unlike Cohen and Sarnecka (2014), we counterbalanced the
order of bounded and unbounded tasks so that any effects of
task order would not influence our overall results.
Counterbalancing also made it possible to test the presence
of order effects. And we found that the order of tasks
sometimes influenced estimates. For example, on the 01000 task, more erroneous estimates were produced in both
tasks if the unbounded task was first presented, F(1, 24) =
9.79, p < .01, Œ∑p2 = .29, suggesting that the greater difficulty
of the unbounded task resulted in fatigue or confusion for
the second task. This is critical because it suggests that
unbounded tasks are not intrinsically easier for children ‚Äì
quite the opposite.
Another important difference came from the analytic
strategies employed. Cohen and Sarnecka (2014) tested the
log or linear model against the 0CPM or 1CPM or 2CMP
model. Because the number of or‚Äôs corresponds to greater
overall model complexity (i.e., greater degrees of freedom),
a poorer fit for one of two family A models than one of
three family B models is ambiguous. Our own analytic
strategy, in contrast, was to explicitly include all of the same
family of models in the same equation (e.g., MLLM,
MCPM1&2, MSPM), and thereby include the correct
number of degrees of freedom. This strategy allowed us to
improve the validity of our model comparison. Additionally,
it yielded two unique insights: that individual differences in
the logarithmicity of estimates were stable across tasks and
that individual differences in logarithmicity of estimates
predicted math skills better than alternative models. These
findings directly contradicted the predictions of the
measurement-skills account and could not be tested using
the analytic strategy of Cohen and Sarnecka (2014).
In conclusion, the present study shows that the log-tolinear shift theory provides a framework for numerical
estimation that is high in descriptive adequacy for both
bounded and unbounded number lines and is reliably
predictive of children‚Äôs mathematics performance. An
interesting question for future studies is whether the same
framework provides a good account of magnitude
estimation more broadly.
