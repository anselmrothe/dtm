Statistical analyses were performed using the Growth Curve
Analysis method (GCA; Mirman, 2014), a variant of
multilevel regression (or hierarchical linear modeling) that
uses orthogonal polynomials to capture the curvilinear
pattern of fixation proportions over time. Effects of the
variables of interest on the polynomial terms provide a way
to quantify and evaluate those effects on statistically
independent (i.e., orthogonal) aspects of the fixation
proportions trajectory. Data were contrast coded and
centered, and unless otherwise specified, the overall target
fixation trajectory was modeled with a cubic polynomial.
Dependent variables included Age (young vs. old),
Condition (definite article “the” vs. indefinite articles
“a”/”an”) and ArtType (Article Type; type of the indefinite
article: “a” vs. “an”). The interaction between these
variables and polynomial terms were explored over the
intercept, linear and quadratic terms, as higher order
interactions are difficult to interpret (see Mirman et al.,

   Table 3 shows the results of the analysis on the “an”
subset. The effect of Condition was significant on the
intercept and quadratic terms, showing that participants used
“an” as a more reliable cue to locate the target compared to
“the”. Importantly, the interaction between Condition and
age was also significant on the linear term. These results
indicate that while, as a group, younger and older adults
both use “an” as an informative cue for finding the referent,
they do so differently. The next set of analyses further
explored these differences by focusing on early and late
time windows.

window of 300 ms, starting 200 ms after the presentation of
the article (to allow for planning and execution of an eye
movement), and ending 240 ms after the onset of the word.
This window best captures early use of phonological cues
for anticipatory target localization. We found a main effect
