can we communicate accurately about spatial relations with
an impoverished, discrete spatial vocabulary? A partial solu-
tion lies in the pragmatics of spatial language. Pragmatic en-
richment allows coarse fixed meanings to gain useful context-
specific refinements (Grice, 1975; Horn, 1984). This is espe-
cially useful when the conveyed states are much finer-grained
than the literal vocabulary. Moreover, the spatial domain pro-
vides a useful test of pragmatic theory: there is a great deal
of room for enrichment in a fine-grained domain.
   To illustrate the potential pragmatics of spatial language,          A flower grew in

with two quarters (represented by the red and blue rectangles)
and a plaza that is located inside one of the quarters (repre-
sented by the dashed circle). Suppose you were told that “a
gold lily grew in the red quarter.” Where would you think                                                                    Or
the flower had grown? Taking “in” at face value (i.e. the lit-
eral meaning) would mean uniform uncertainty over the red
region. But a pragmatic listener could arrive at a more spe-
cific interpretation: The speaker did not say the lily was in
the plaza, nor near the plaza, nor on the edge of the red quar-
ter.... From this a listener could infer that the lily was proba-

favor the center. For example, in Figure 4(b), bottom: Peo-

In 10,000 simulations of 49 participants that guess uniformly
over the Red Quarter, none have the center account for more

the other regions as well, as shown in Figure 2, though it is
