   As before, the study was split into two rounds, and each
round began with Meet the Movies (Figure 1a). In the first
round, participants observed the target’s choices (Observe
Other; Figure 1b). Participants were shown pairs of movie
posters, and a border appeared around the movie that the
target had chosen. To ensure that participants attended to the
task, we asked them to imitate the target’s choice by
selecting the highlighted movie. Instead of using all 56
possible pairs, we excluded 8 pairs in which the artificial
agent would be indifferent between the two movies; thus,
participants saw 48 choices total.
   In the second round (Choose for Other; Figure 1b),
participants were again shown pairs of movies, but were
instead asked to select the movie that they believed the
target had chosen. Participants were not given trial-by-trial
feedback, but they were informed that they would receive a
bonus based on the number of correct responses in this task.
   Note that the MML model had perfect information about
each movie’s features, while human observers had no prior
knowledge of the movies. Even though participants had a
chance to “meet” the movies, we reasoned that this brief
pre-exposure would be insufficient to eliminate their
uncertainty about the dimensions of the feature space as
well as the uncertainty about each movie’s features. Thus, in
Experiment 1b, we provided keywords for each movie (e.g.,
“positive, historical, romantic”) during all tasks, making
explicit the features of each movie. This ensured that the
task for our human participants was comparable to the task          Figure 1: (a) Task order: In Experiment 1a, participants only chose
