remains: Not everyone can comprehend sequences of
images.
   Some comparable findings have occurred in more recent
work on temporal cognition. This research uses a “card
sorting task” which asks participants to spatially arrange
visual events, with the idea that the layout (vertical,
horizontal, circular, etc.) can inform about possible spatial
metaphors underlying temporal cognition (Núñez &
Cooperrider, 2013). However, results using these tasks in
native communities have been mixed, and, again, often
depend on participants’ familiarity with comics and/or
written language (Le Guen & Pool Balam, 2012; Levinson
& Majid, 2013). Such limitations have lead to critiques that
“in small-scale communities…[these tasks may not be]
well-suited…because they presuppose familiarity with
materials and practices that, in fact, require considerable
cultural scaffolding” (Núñez & Cooperrider, 2013, p. 225).
   This necessity for exposure to a graphic system has been
echoed in cross-cultural research on production of
sequential images. For example, Japanese children, who are
immersed in a culture of comics, draw far more advanced
visual narratives than children from other countries like the
United States or Egypt (Wilson & Wilson, 1987). A study in
Egypt has made this role the most salient (Wilson, 2016).
Suburban Egyptian children, who had exposure to illustrated
books and comics, drew narratives with a similar
