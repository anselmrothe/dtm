Abstract

However, empirical research about the comprehension of
sequential images challenges these assumptions. Though
some of this research is several decades old, they are
supplemented by recent growing work on visual narratives,
and the overall lessons remain relevant and important for
consideration. Here, I will review this literature on
sequential image comprehension, focusing on cross-cultural
research, developmental research, and recent neurocognitive
research. Altogether, such work will show that sequential
images require exposure and practice with a graphic system
in order to establish a “fluency” in comprehending this
“visual language” (Cohn, 2013). Because of this,
researchers should question the assumptions they hold about
sequential images, and should be more careful in their use
of visual narratives as stimuli for experimental tasks.

Sequential images have frequently been used as experimental
stimuli in the cognitive and psychological sciences to explore
topics like theory of mind, temporal cognition, discourse,
social intelligence, and event sequencing, among others. The
assumption has been that sequential images provide a fairly
universal and transparent stimuli that require little to no
learning to decode, and thus are ideal for non-verbal tasks in
developmental, clinical, and non-literate populations.
However, decades of cross-cultural and developmental
research have actually suggested something different: that
sequential image comprehension is contingent on exposure
and practice with a graphic system. I here review this
literature and advocate for more sensitivity to the “fluency”
needed to understand sequential images.

Understanding sequential images

Introduction
Researchers in the cognitive and psychological sciences
have often relied on wordless sequential images like comics
in experimental tasks. Most often, these tasks focus on using
sequential images for elicitation, while aiming to investigate
some other aspect of cognition. We find sequential images
used in popular procedures for theory of mind
(Baron‐Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1986; Sivaratnam, Cornish,
Gray, Howlin, & Rinehart, 2012), temporal cognition
(Núñez & Cooperrider, 2013), discourse (Gernsbacher,
1985), social intelligence (Campbell & McCord, 1996), and
event sequencing (Tinaz, Schendan, Schon, & Stern, 2006),
not to mention the longstanding use of the Picture
Arrangement Task as a measure in the WAIS-IQ test battery
and other clinical assessments (Kaufman & Lichtenberger,
2006; Ramos & Die, 1986). The assumption has been that
sequential images provide a universally understood medium
of communication that is transparent to participants. They
are believed to be understandable by everyone—including
young children—with little learning or decoding necessary
since they are assumed to rely on perceptual processing
alone (e.g., McCloud, 1993).
This assumed transparency is likely underscored by the
iconicity of images and a logic that may go something like
this: Sequential images typically depict events visually, and
everyone understands events transparently via perceptual
processing; thus sequential images should be understandable
to everyone. This thinking has lead to their frequent use in
experiments for children and clinical populations, and in
anthropological work, especially with non-literate
populations.

Only recently has research on sequential image
comprehension begun to explore the structure of visual
narratives in the context of the cognitive sciences (Cohn,
2013). At their most complex, drawn sequential images—as
found in comics—use a visual narrative structure that
packages meaningful information into hierarchic
constituents (Cohn, Jackendoff, Holcomb, & Kuperberg,
2014). Such structures extend beyond just the meaningful
understandings of events between images (Cohn, Paczynski,
Jackendoff, Holcomb, & Kuperberg, 2012), and seem to
engage similar neural mechanisms as language processing
(Cohn et al., 2014; Cohn et al., 2012; Magliano, Larson,
Higgs, & Loschky, 2015). However, the foundations for
sequential image comprehension are more basic.
Consider the sequence in Figure 1, which appeared as a
stimulus in a study by Byram and Garforth (1980),
discussed below. If a person recognizes this as a visual
narrative sequence, it shows a boy watering plants under the
hot sun. He begins to sweat, as indicated by water droplets
jumping off his head in the second image. In the final panel,
he is therefore shown with shirt off, watering himself
instead of the plants. The ability construe the meaning of
these successive images requires knowledge of causation
both between the character and the sun, and between the
contents of each image. Narratively, this sequence shows a
set-up in the first image, an initiation of the event in the
second image, and a climax in the final panel (Cohn, 2013).
Such narrative states are cued by a variety of factors,
including the change in position of the character between
frames, and the conventionalized sweat drops leaping off the
boy’s head (Cohn, 2013; Forceville, 2011).

Figure 1: A simple sequence of images used in cross-cultural research in Botswana, from Byram and Garforth (1980).

Despite these narrative and causal relations, at the most
simple level, understanding of sequential images requires
only two basic constraints (Bornens, 1990; Cohn, In prep).
First, a comprehender needs to understand that the
characters and elements found in one image are the same
referential entities as those in prior and subsequent images.
This is the continuity constraint. In Figure 1, this constraint
guides our recognition that the character in the first frame is
the same as the character in the second and third frames.
Without adhering to the continuity constraint, we might
interpret each frame as depicting a different scene and thus a
different character. In this case, Figure 1 would not show
one boy three times, but would show three separate boys.
Second, a comprehender must also recognize that these
continuous referential elements take on different temporal,
causal, spatial, and/or narrative states in comparison to those
in the prior and subsequent images. In Figure 1, this activity
constraint allows us to recognize not only that it is the same
character across images, but that this character is in different
related states in each frame (here, temporal/narrative states).
Without this constraint, the images may be recognized as all
showing the same referential elements (characters,
background, etc.) but would not be distinguished as
conveying a sequence with linkages between them. In other
words, each image would be a scene unto itself. In Figure 1,
each image would be its own scene of the same boy, if
adhering to the continuity constraint, or of different boys, if
flouting the continuity constraint.
The combination of the continuity and activity constraints
provide the foundation for all other understanding of
sequential images as a sequence. These very basic
constraints are necessary for comprehenders to further
construe more complex aspects of sequential images. For
example, higher levels of sequential image comprehension
involve the mapping of visual cues in images to narrative
roles, the organization of those images into hierarchic
constituents, and modification of those sequences using
complex framing devices (Cohn, 2013, In prep). As will
become clear in the next sections, most limitations in
sequential image understanding do not reach these more
complex levels. Rather, they demonstrate problems with
these simple constraints on continuity and activity. Both
high-level and low-level constraints operate on individual

image sequences (like strips) and internally to the sequences
of longer works (like comic books).

Cross-cultural fluency
The universality of sequential images is first called into
question by considering cross-cultural research. In work
from the 1960s-1980s, researchers examined wordless
sequential images as a means to communicate non-verbally
in cross-cultural settings, often with rural, non-literate
individuals. Such work often had a practical intent for
purposes of educational and/or humanitarian efforts on
behalf of these populations, and similar efforts persist in
contemporary efforts to use comics as a “universal”
communicative tool (e.g., www.comicsunitingnations.org).
However, this earlier work found sequential images to be
fairly inadequate materials, because various populations did
not construe the meaning of these stimuli as expected.
In many cases, respondents had difficulty interpreting the
sequential images as a sequence. For example, a study in
Nepal found that many respondents did not understand that
images repeated the same characters across a 3-image long
sequence (Fussell & Haaland, 1978). Similar strain in
interpretations were shown by respondents in Papua New
Guinea (Bishop, 1977), where some individuals had
difficulty construing sequences as conveying temporal
orders (Cook, 1980), though this effect was improved with
practice and familiarity with Western pictures and comics.
An older study in Kenya likewise found that people had
trouble recognizing a sequence of images as being in a
sequence (Holmes, 1963). Additional work in Africa found
that rural Bantu populations (Zulu and Tsonga) in South
Africa interpreted sequential images as conveying temporal
states of the same character (continuity and activity
constraints) less than European counterparts, though this
ability increased with age and acculturation (Duncan,
Gourlay, & Hudson, 1973). Later work in South Africa
found similar interpretations between South Africans and
their British counterparts, with effects modulated by
exposure to graphics and literacy (Liddell, 1996, 1997).
Comparable accounts in Africa were found with the Basotho
people (Jenkins, 1978) and in Botswana (Byram & Garforth,
1980).

2058

In these studies, individuals did not seem to be construing
sequential images as a sequence, and sometimes
“misinterpreted” the contents of the individual images
themselves (Duncan et al., 1973; Fussell & Haaland, 1978).
Most often, these individuals interpreted each image as its
own scene, and did not follow the continuity constraint
binding each image to the next. It is noteworthy that these
individuals typically lived in more rural communities, with
little or no exposure to sequential images in the form of
comics or picture books. Those who did have access to such
materials—along with literacy—had a greater likelihood of
making the sequential interpretations. Also, while many of
these studies are fairly old and may not reflect the current
status of such populations’ understandings, the main point
remains: Not everyone can comprehend sequences of
images.
Some comparable findings have occurred in more recent
work on temporal cognition. This research uses a “card
sorting task” which asks participants to spatially arrange
visual events, with the idea that the layout (vertical,
horizontal, circular, etc.) can inform about possible spatial
metaphors underlying temporal cognition (Núñez &
Cooperrider, 2013). However, results using these tasks in
native communities have been mixed, and, again, often
depend on participants’ familiarity with comics and/or
written language (Le Guen & Pool Balam, 2012; Levinson
& Majid, 2013). Such limitations have lead to critiques that
“in small-scale communities…[these tasks may not be]
well-suited…because they presuppose familiarity with
materials and practices that, in fact, require considerable
cultural scaffolding” (Núñez & Cooperrider, 2013, p. 225).
This necessity for exposure to a graphic system has been
echoed in cross-cultural research on production of
sequential images. For example, Japanese children, who are
immersed in a culture of comics, draw far more advanced
visual narratives than children from other countries like the
United States or Egypt (Wilson & Wilson, 1987). A study in
Egypt has made this role the most salient (Wilson, 2016).
Suburban Egyptian children, who had exposure to illustrated
books and comics, drew narratives with a similar
proficiency as children in the United States. This starkly
contrasted with the children from rural villages, who had
little access to such visual culture, where only 4-8% of
children drew coherent sequential visual narratives. In these
cases, the images in the sequences were isolated objects or
events, or had only loose semantic relations. This resembles
the inability to establish continuity across sequential images,
here in production rather than comprehension. Such findings
reinforce that sequential image understanding cannot rely on
the architecture of the visual perceptual system alone
(Duncan et al., 1973; Fussell & Haaland, 1978).

Development of fluency
Because exposure and practice appear necessary for the
understanding of sequential images, it implies the need for
learning of this system of communication. We should then
ask: what is the developmental trajectory for such

comprehension? This question becomes particularly
important given the widespread use of visual narratives in
tasks for children (e.g., Baron‐Cohen et al., 1986;
Sivaratnam et al., 2012), particularly those used to
ostensibly assess the age of onset of other cognitive
functions, such as Theory of Mind or IQ.
In fact, developmental studies on sequential image
comprehension date back almost 100 years. Research by
Piaget and colleagues (Krafft & Piaget, 1925; Margairaz &
Piaget, 1925), argued that not until the ages of 7 or 8 did
children recognize that characters occurring across images
were the same character at different states, rather than
numerous different characters (i.e., the continuity
constraint).

Figure 2: Graphs of data adapted from Bornens (1990).
“Unicity” (A) refers to the ability to recognize that characters in
one image were the same as those in a prior image (the “continuity
constraint”). “Link up” (B) refers to the recognition that characters
in one image were in a successive state than those in a prior image
(the “activity constraint”). In both cases, these abilities are poor
under age 5, but proficient by age 6.

More recent research has suggested the understanding of
the continuity constraint in children of much younger ages.
Bornens
(1990)
assessed
children’s
verbalized
understandings of several sequential image scenarios for
both their ability to grasp “unicity” (i.e., continuity
constraint) and “link up” (i.e., activity constraint) of
characters across images. Figure 2 adapts the results from
this study into graphs (provided numerically in the paper).
As depicted in Figure 2A, children at or below the age of 4
had significant difficulty in maintaining continuity of
characters between images, but started understanding that

2059

characters across images repeat in different states by age 4
and 5, before progressing to a full understanding at age 6. A
similar finding appeared for children’s ability to “link up”
the actions of the events between images (the continuity
constraint), as depicted in Figure 2B. It is also noteworthy
that these findings were modulated by children’s socioeconomic status, with those from less “culturally privileged”
environments not reaching proficiency until between ages 5
and 7, perhaps suggesting a difference in exposure to visual
material, as in the findings of visual narrative “fluency”
discussed above.
The ages of onset for sequential image comprehension in
this study are consistent with other findings. For example,
arranging images into a logically and/or temporally ordered
sequence is difficult for 2 and 3 year olds (Weist,
Atanassova, Wysocka, & Pawlak, 1999; Weist, Lyytinen,
Wysocka, & Atanassova, 1997), but can be done
proficiently by 4 or 5 year olds (Fivush & Mandler, 1985;
Friedman, 1990; Weist et al., 1999; Weist et al., 1997).
Children by around the age of 5 can also reconstruct
logically ordered sequences better than random image
sequences (Brown, 1975). Additional work has shown that
the ability to recognize and infer missing images from a
visual narrative begins around age 5 (Brown & French,
1976; Schmidt & Paris, 1978; Schmidt, Paris, & Stober,
1979), though this ability is modulated by the degree to
which sequences maintain a continuity of common
characters across images (Kunen, Chabaud, & Dean, 1987).
Both picture arrangement and the ability to infer omitted
information appear to continue developing into later years,
though age alone does not determine proficiency: it is
modulated by experience with comics (Nakazawa, 2016).
Such findings overall suggest that the continuity and
activity constraints come online between the ages of 4 and
5. However, given the findings in cross-cultural research,
such ages likely reflect age of onset when children have
cultural exposure to sequential images.

Experience in fluent populations
The studies discussed above imply that the understanding of
sequential images requires exposure to visual narratives, and
in such context, follows a consistent developmental
trajectory. What about the understanding of sequential
images by adults in cultures with rich visual narratives?
Sequential images should pose no problems to experimental
participants so long as they are healthy, college-aged adults
from visually rich cultures, right?
First, there are no guarantees that participants have
acquired the requisite “fluency” to gain proficiency in
comprehending sequential images, even if they belong to a
broader culture that has rich visual narratives. Without
assessment, we cannot simply assume that everyone in a
given culture will behave uniformly. While no studies have
yet to explicitly study the range of such fluencies, anecdotes
abound from individuals who claim that they “can’t
understand comics.”

Second, more empirically grounded data has shown that
even when the basic ability to understand sequential images
seems intact (i.e., the continuity and activity constraints),
and visual narratives take more complex characteristics,
various aspects of comprehension are modulated by
frequency of comic reading. For example, Nakazawa (2016)
has designed the Chiba University Comics Comprehension
Test (CCCT), which involves a battery of tests including
picture arrangement and fill-in-the-blank tasks. The CCCT
has been used to assess the comprehension of sequential
images in both children and adults. In general, Nakazawa
(2016) has found that the ability to understand comics is
modulated by age and expertise, with college students (who
most frequently read comics) having greater proficiency
than both younger children/teenagers and older adults.
However, Japanese college students were shown to be more
proficient in their visual narrative comprehension than
American college students (Nakazawa & Shwalb, 2012).
This difference was attributed to the relative pervasiveness
of manga readership throughout Japanese society, in
contrast to the more niche subculture of comics readership
in the United States.
In addition, recent research has included a measure of
“comic reading experience” in both behavioral and
neurocognitive testing of visual narrative processing. The
Visual Language Fluency Index (VLFI) questionnaire
assesses the frequency with which individuals read and
draw a variety of types of visual narratives (comic books,
comic strips, graphic novels, Japanese manga), and their
self-rated “expertise” in that understanding. This
information is combined in the following formula to
compute a “VLFI score”, weighted more to comprehension
(comic reading) than production (comic drawing):

This metric has been shown to correlate with a range of
manipulations to sequential images—particularly more
complex aspects of narrative structure—in measurements
including response times, viewing times, and the amplitudes
of neural responses in event-related brain potentials (Cohn
& Kutas, 2015; Cohn & Maher, 2015; Cohn et al., 2012).
Resources related to the VLFI can be found at:
http://www.visuallanguagelab.com/resources.html.
Such findings suggest that, even with proficiency in the
basic understandings of sequential images with healthy,
college-aged adults, experience modulates the processing of
visual narratives. Thus, if sequential images are used as an
elicitation for probing other cognitive abilities, there is no
guarantee that participants will be uniform in their
comprehension of those stimuli without some form of
assessment.

Conclusion
Altogether, the studies in this review suggest that sequential
image understanding is a culturally learned ability
contingent on exposure and practice with visual narratives,

2060

such as comics and illustrated picture books. Such findings
distinctly contrast with the general assumptions that
sequential images are transparently understood, universal
across cultures, and require no explicit learning (e.g.,
McCloud, 1993). Given that many experimental procedures
have used sequential images as stimuli, researchers should
be sensitive to these issues when designing studies and
tasks. Such findings also call into question the degree to
which results found in prior experiments are reflective of the
actual cognition that is being tested (theory of mind, timespace metaphors, IQ, etc.) or if they reflect the ability of
participants to understand sequential images at a basic level.
For example, do picture arrangement tasks really inform
about space-time metaphors (Núñez & Cooperrider, 2013)
or IQ (Kaufman & Lichtenberger, 2006; Ramos & Die,
1986), or are these confounded by visual narrative fluency?
In many cases, drawn sequential images may not be
necessary, as technological advancement makes the use of
videos far easier for tasks requiring elicitation. While more
complicated aspects of visual narrative patterning do appear
difficult for naïve film viewers to understand, lower level
issues like the continuity or activity constraints appear to be
spared (Ildirar & Schwan, 2015; Schwan & Ildirar, 2010).
This may be due to filmic use of basic percepts (instead of
drawings) and their pervasive temporality and movement,
which requires less decoding than drawn conventions.
Nevertheless, this does not mean that experimentation
should avoid sequential images completely. If sequential
images are used as stimuli, researchers are encouraged to
assess the “fluency” of their participants in this “visual
language” (i.e., using the VLFI or CCCT), just as they
would be expected to assess participants’ proficiency in
other expressive systems, like language.
Given that research on sequential images has only
recently progressed with seriousness in the cognitive
sciences, future work should examine additional behavioral
“fluency” assessments beyond the VLFI or CCCT. It is also
unclear whether fluency varies based on the specific tasks
involved in sequential images (e.g., picture arrangement vs.
elicitation). In addition, studies will need to investigate just
how general cognitive processes (memory, perception,
attention) interact with visual narrative specific aspects of
sequential image comprehension and fluency. Together,
such efforts will further inform our understandings of
sequential image comprehension, and the degree to which
they may be used in other experimental tasks.
