Abstract
Individual differences in reflectiveness have been found to
predict belief in God. We hypothesize that this association
may be due to a broader inclination for intuitive thinkers to
endorse teleological explanations. In support of our
hypothesis, we find that scientifically unfounded teleological
explanations are more likely to be endorsed by intuitive
compared to analytical thinkers, and that those who endorse
teleological explanations are more likely to have religious
beliefs.

Introduction
Religious beliefs have enormous impact on our lives.
They affect our moral and political values, our personal
relationships, and our life goals. While people are often
aware of the overt influences of religion, there may be a
deeper connection between religious belief and general
cognition (Barrett, 2000). How does cognitive style affect
religious belief, and what makes some people more inclined
to believe in God than others?
Kelemen (2004) proposed that children are intuitive
theists who have a natural predisposition to believe in God.
The foundation of this claim rests on the finding that
children are teleologically promiscuous: Children tend to
generate and endorse explanations for phenomena that
ascribe a purpose or intention to the effect that is being
explained (Kelemen, 1999), even when these explanations
are scientifically unsupported. As a result, many children
may readily endorse explanations that appeal to God—the
ultimate teleological explanation—and this belief may
persist through adulthood.
However, childhood religious beliefs do not always
indicate what a person will believe as an adult. The Pew
Forum on Religion & Public Life (2009) found that roughly
half of Americans have changed religious affiliations at
least once since childhood. A majority of those who
reported no religious affiliation during childhood now
belong to a religious affiliation. Conversely, 16% of adult
Americans report having no religious affiliation, though
only 7% were raised without a religious affiliation.
Together, these finding suggest that religious beliefs in the
United States are fluid, with some embracing religion only
later in life and others abandoning their childhood beliefs.
Children may be intuitive theists, but this cannot explain
why religious views change over the lifespan.

One of the most commonly cited reasons for becoming
affiliated or unaffiliated with a religion is a change in one’s
belief in God (Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, 2009).
Many of those who left their childhood religion expressed
the view that “modern science proves religion is a
superstition” and that they “just don’t believe in God”
anymore. In contrast, many of those who embraced religion
later in life indicated that they felt “called by God.”
Although it is common to think of belief in God as an
unshakeable conviction, there have been many arguments
both for and against the existence of God. Christian
philosophers have presented teleological arguments in
support of God’s existence (Aquinas 1274/1938; Paley,
1802), while other scholars have presented scientific
arguments against the existence of God (Darwin, 1859;
Dawkins, 1986). How susceptible is faith to reasoned
argument? If these arguments do affect religious belief, then
individuals who are more strongly influenced by
teleological arguments should be more likely to believe in
God.
Recent research has suggested that individuals who adopt
an analytical thinking style are less likely to have strong
religious beliefs. For instance, those who neglect base-rates
in a statistical problem in favor of qualitative, case-based
reasoning were more likely to express a belief in God
(Pennycook, Cheyne, Seli, Koehler, & Fugelsang, 2012).
Likewise, participants who scored highly on the Cognitive
Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005), used to measure the
ability to deliberate and suppress intuitive yet incorrect
responses to analytical problems, reported lower beliefs in
God (Pennycook et al., 2012; Shenhav, Rand, & Greene,
2012). A variety of experimental manipulations support a
causal role of analytical thinking in religious belief.
Participants who were asked to describe a time when they
used intuition to solve a problem were more likely to report
a belief in God than those who described a situation that
required careful reasoning to solve a problem (Shenhav et
al., 2012). Even subtler manipulations, such as visual or
linguistic priming of analytical thought, have shown an
effect on reported religious beliefs (Gervais & Norenzayan,
2012).
Our hypothesis is that the relation between analytical
thinking and religious belief is mediated by a willingness to
endorse teleological explanations. Specifically, we
hypothesize that intuitive thinkers will be more likely to
endorse scientifically unfounded teleological explanations,
in part because they are less likely to reflect on causal
directionality. In other words, intuitive thinkers may endorse

1217

teleological explanations because they confuse an effect
with an intention to cause that effect (i.e., a teleological
cause). In contrast, analytical thinkers may be more likely to
reject teleological explanations that erroneously reverse
cause and effect.

Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we seek to establish a correlation between
teleological reasoning and analytical thinking, as well as
replicate two previous findings that show a connection
between religious belief and teleological reasoning
(Heywood & Bering, 2013; Banerjee & Bloom, 2014), and
between religious belief and analytical thinking (Pennycook
et al., 2012; Shenhav et al., 2012; Gervais & Norenzayan,
2012).

Methods
Participants. 65 participants (40 male, 25 female, ages 1966, median age 29) completed the experiment via Amazon
Mechanical Turk. All participants were located in the
United States.
Materials and Procedure. The experiment consisted of
four sections in order: an abbreviated numeracy scale, a set
of true/false teleological explanations, an extended cognitive
reflection test (CRT), and a religious questionnaire1.
First, participants completed an abbreviated numeracy
scale (Weller et al., 2013). The six-item scale measures a
participant’s ability to evaluate numerical problems
involving percentages, probabilities, and basic mathematical
operations. Some evidence suggests that the CRT may be
essentially a measure of numeracy (Weller et al., 2013). We
included a numeracy scale in order to rule out the possibility
that CRT is measuring numeracy alone.
Second, participants completed a test of teleological
reasoning consisting of 40 single-sentence explanations that
suggest an intentional cause, taken from Kelemen, Rottman,
& Seston (2013). Participants read each explanation and
judged whether it was true or false. Twenty of the
explanations were test stimuli. These explanations were
scientifically unsupported teleological explanations, such as
“Bees frequent flowers in order to aid pollination.”
Although it is true that bees frequent flowers and that they
do aid pollination, they do not visit flowers in order to aid
pollination. That is, the bee’s role in pollinating flowers is
not intentional.
The remaining twenty explanations were control stimuli,
half teleological and half causal (non-teleological).
Additionally, half of each type were true and half false. For
example, two of the control stimuli include “Houses have
doorbells in order to make dogs bark,” (false teleological)
and “A lightbulb shines because electricity passes through
its filaments,” (true causal). The control stimuli were used
1

The full experimental stimuli used in both experiments are
available at http://research.clps.brown.edu/SlomanLab/cogsci2016/

to ensure participants had no trouble reasoning about
teleological and causal explanations in general. The order of
the control and test stimuli were pseudo-randomized.
Third, participants completed the CRT, designed to
measure the degree to which one engages in analytical as
opposed to intuitive thinking. The original scale (Frederick,
2005) is made up of three questions in which the intuitive
response is incorrect. Participants who engage in reflective
thinking (analytical reasoning) may override the tendency to
respond with their first instinct, and instead arrive at the
correct answer. For instance, one question reads, “If it takes
5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it
take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?” The intuitive
response is 100 minutes, whereas the correct analytical
response if 5 minutes. Several variants of the CRT have
been proposed that include more than three items. We
employed a six-item version that includes the original three
questions plus three new questions (Toplak, West, &
Stanovich, 2014)2.
Finally, participants completed a religious questionnaire
identical to that used in Shenhav et al. (2012). Participants
reported their belief in God on a 7-point Likert scale from
“Confident atheist” to “Confident believer” (midpoint
“Agnostic/undecided”). Additional Likert questions probed
the participant’s familial religiosity during childhood, belief
in an immortal soul, change in religious belief since
childhood, and whether they had a belief that convinced
them of God’s existence (yes/no).

Results
Following Kelemen et al. (2013), seven participants were
excluded from analysis for answering fewer than 80% of the
teleological reasoning control questions correct, leaving a
total of 58 participants remaining. Although performance on
these control stimuli was not related to any of the primary
measures of interest (CRT or religious belief, both p > .14),
there was a significant positive correlation between
performance on the control questions and numeracy
(r = .26, p = .048). The control questions were not used in
subsequent analyses. Pairwise correlations from Experiment
1 are reported in Table 1.
CRT and Religious Belief. Participants were assigned a
CRT score based on the number of correct (analytical)
responses (0-6). We found a significant negative correlation
between CRT and belief in God (r = -.37, p = .004).
Participants who performed well on the CRT (more
analytical responses) reported less of a belief in God than
those who scored poorly on the CRT, even though CRT
performance does not predict religious beliefs during
childhood (r = -.11, p = .41).

Toplak, West, & Stanovich, (2014) propose a seven-item
version of the CRT, but due to an error we excluded the sixth item.

Experiment 2

Numeracy and Religious Belief. Performance on the sixitem numeracy scale did not predict belief in God (r= -.14,
p = .3). This suggests that the predictive ability of the
cognitive reflection test is not due to differences in
numerical ability.

CRT and Teleological Beliefs. Our original hypothesis
was that those who engage in analytical reasoning are less
likely to endorse false teleological explanations. Indeed,
we found that participants who scored highly on the CRT
were less likely to endorse teleological explanations
(r = -.32, p = .016). We also found that numeracy predicts
endorsement of teleological explanations (r = -.29, p =
.029). However, given that the teleological explanations
contained no numerical information, it is unlikely that
numeracy has direct influence on teleological reasoning.

Experiment 1 found that participants who engaged in
analytical thinking were less likely to endorse
scientifically unwarranted teleological explanations. It is
hard to imagine how to explain this result and others (e.g.,
Kelemen & Rosset, 2009) without assuming that
teleological explanations have an intuitive appeal that can
be overridden by more deliberative processes. In
Experiment 2, we test a mechanistic account of why this
might be. Specifically, we propose that intuitive thinkers
are more likely to neglect causal directionality, leading
them to endorse teleological explanations in which the
intention to bring about an effect is itself a cause. We test
whether participants who attend to causal relations are
less likely to endorse teleological explanations.
We suggest this mechanism may lead high CRT to be
unwilling to endorse teleological explanations. For
example, consider the explanation “Bees frequent flowers
in order to aid pollination.” An individual who is aware of
causal directionality may correctly reason that a bee’s
flower visit is a cause of pollination, but that the reverse
is not true: the desire to pollinate a flower is not a cause
of the bee’s visit. That is, bees do not visit flowers in
order to pollinate them. This ability to identify causal
directionality is crucial to successfully evaluate
teleological explanations. If intuitive thinkers are more
likely to neglect causal directionality, they should be
more likely to endorse some false teleological
explanations.

Discussion

Methods

Religious Belief and Teleological Belief. To construct a
teleological reasoning score for each participant, we
counted the number of teleological test questions that
were endorsed (0-20). We found that participants who
reported a strong belief in God were more likely to
endorse teleological explanations, a marginally significant
result (r = .24, p = .067). However, a post-hoc analysis
controlling for familial religiosity indicated a significant
partial correlation between teleological reasoning and
belief in God (r = .27, p = .037). This suggests that the
effect of teleological reasoning on religious belief may be
moderated by religious upbringing.

Experiment 1 replicates several findings from prior
literature. Specifically, we find that that both analytical
thinking and teleological reasoning predict belief in God.
We also demonstrate a novel effect: analytical style
predicts willingness to endorse teleological explanations.
Given these preliminary results, we conducted a followup study to examine these effects with a larger sample
size. In addition, we propose and test a mechanism by
which analytical style influences teleological reasoning.

Participants. 188 participants (99 male, 87 female, 1
other, 1 unknown, ages 18-66, median age 26) completed
the experiment. 135 participants (72%) were recruited via
Amazon Mechanical Turk, while 53 participants (28%)
were recruited from the Brown University undergraduate
subject pool for course credit. All participants were
located in the United States.
Materials and Procedure. Participants completed four
tasks: the six-item CRT (identical to Experiment 1), an
abbreviated teleological reasoning test, a causal reasoning
test, and a religious questionnaire1. Questions were inter-

1219

mixed and pseudo-randomized except for those from the
religious questionnaire, which were presented last.
To avoid redundancy, we tested an abbreviated version
of the teleological reasoning test used in Experiment 1.
We used only five test items and three control items. The
test items chosen were the most discriminative in
Experiment 1, teleological explanations whose responses
were highly dependent on CRT score. The three control
items all had a high proportion of correct responses in
Experiment 1.
The causal reasoning test included six conditional
probability problems, including two from Tversky and
Kahneman (1977) and four novel problems with the same
structure. Each question presented participants with a
scenario and asked them to choose the most likely of three
options. One question, borrowed from Tversky and
Kahneman (1977), read:

Which of the following events is more probable?
(a) That a woman has held a leading part in a
musical given that she can sing
(b) That a woman can sing given that she has held a
leading part in a musical
(c) Equally likely
The correct answer is (b) as all leads in a musical can
sing, though not everyone who can sing has held the lead
in a musical. These causal reasoning control questions
were used to measure a participant’s ability to reason
through conditional probability questions more generally.
Finally, we used a religious questionnaire identical to
that of Experiment 1, with two additional questions to
gauge the participant’s belief in God’s agency: “To what
extent do you believe that a God or Supreme being
actively influences events in the world over the course of
a day, and over the course of a century?”

Which of the following is more probable?
(a) That a girl has blue eyes if her mother has blue
eyes
(b) That a mother has blue eyes if her daughter has
blue eyes
(c) Equally likely

Results
Eleven participants were excluded from the analyses for
failure to answer all three control teleological questions
correctly. The teleological control questions were not
analyzed further.

The correct answer to this, and to all of our conditional
probability problems was (c): Equally likely. Kahneman
and Tversky (1977) found that people often exhibit a bias
when answering these problems, with a significant portion
of participants responding (a) and very few responding
(b). This result has been explained as a causal bias due to
the strong forward causal relation from a mother’s eye
color to a daughter’s eye color. Though people correctly
reason that a daughter’s eye color cannot influence her
mother’s eye color, they fail to identify that this does not
influence the relative conditional probabilities of (a) and
(b).
Participants with strong causal reasoning skills may be
more likely to fall prey to this bias. Conversely, those
who neglect causal directionality may be less likely to
exhibit this bias and instead arrive at the correct answer.
Thus, we hypothesize that participants who engage in
deliberate analytical thinking will be better at causal
reasoning, and less likely to arrive at the correct answers.
As such, we expect participants who score high on the
CRT to be less likely to answer the causal reasoning
questions correctly.
In addition, we included three causal reasoning control
questions. These questions were of a similar format to the
causal reasoning test questions, except that the conditional
probabilities were unbalanced so that the correct answer
was not “Equally likely.” For instance, one question
asked:

CRT, Teleological Reasoning, and Belief in God. We
replicated many of the effects found in Experiment 1.
Participants who scored high on the CRT were less likely
to endorse teleological explanations (r = -.32, p < .001,
see Figure 1) and less likely to report a belief in God (r = .29, p < .001). We also found a robust correlation between
teleological reasoning and belief in God (r = .27, p < .001,
see Figure 2). Note that undergraduate students were less
likely to answer the CRT questions correctly (p = .04) but
more likely to express a belief in God (p = .07) compared
to Mechanical Turk participants.
Our primary hypothesis was that analytical style leads
to decreased religious belief because analytical reasoning
affects our ability to evaluate teleological arguments. We
tested this hypothesis using a mediation analysis, and find
that teleological reasoning does mediate the relation
between CRT performance and belief in God, Sobel’s z=2.24, p=.025. This shows that teleological reasoning
accounts for a significant portion of the shared variance
between CRT and belief in God. However because our
design is entirely correlational, we cannot rule out
alternative hypotheses. It may be, for instance, that
religious beliefs influence teleological reasoning.
Causal Reasoning. Participants were assigned a causal
reasoning score based on the number of correctly
answered causal reasoning test questions (0-6). We did
not find support for our hypothesis that intuitive thinkers
are less likely to exhibit a causal reasoning bias. Causal
reasoning scores did not correlate significantly with CRT
scores, teleological reasoning scores, or belief in God (all
p > .17).

Discussion

We assessed participants’ performance on the causal
reasoning control questions to ensure that this was not due
to a failure to understand conditional probability problems
more generally. Performance on these control questions,
where the correct answer is consistent with a causal bias,
was significantly positively correlated with both CRT
scores (r = .26, p < .001) and negatively correlated with
teleological reasoning (r = -.16, p = .039). That is,
participants who were better at these control conditional
probability problems were more likely to engage in
analytical thinking and were less likely to endorse
teleological explanations, as expected.
Performance on the causal reasoning control questions
was negatively correlated with performance on the test
questions (r = -.30, p < .001). This is consistent with our
initial hypothesis: some participants are lured by the
forward causal option, leading them to get the control
questions correct but the test questions wrong; other
participants are not influenced by the causal lure and
instead prefer the “Equally likely” option, leading them to
get the test questions correct but the control questions
wrong. What is surprising is that this behavior is not
accounted for by analytical style.

Our results lend support to our initial hypothesis that
teleological reasoning is a mediating factor that affects the
relationship between analytical thinking and religious
belief. However we cannot rule out the alternative
possibility that religious participants were more likely to
endorse teleological explanations because of their
religious beliefs. This may be a reasonable position for
some explanations. For instance, a religious thinker who
believes in intelligent design may endorse the teleological
explanation that “lemurs have adapted in order to avoid
extinction.” However it seems less likely that those same
religious beliefs would cause a participant to endorse nonevolutionary teleological arguments, such as “hurricanes
circulate seawater to gather energy,” or teleological
arguments that appear to superficially endorse evolution,
such as “the fittest animals survive so that species can
grow stronger.”
We found no strong support for our mechanistic
hypothesis that intuitive thinkers endorse teleological
explanations due to a failure to distinguish between cause
and effect, but we did uncover a novel and strange effect:
Performance on standard conditional probability
questions predicted susceptibility to causal bias on
conditional probability problems used by Kahenman and

1221

Tversky (1977). Although we predicted this result, our
proposed mediating variable (CRT performance) failed to
account for it.
One possibility is that performance on the causal
reasoning test questions is influenced by two factors. On
the one hand, participants must think analytically. On the
other hand, participants must ignore causal directionality.
If these two factors are in opposition to each other, it
could explain why we observed a null effect for the
correlation between causal reasoning test questions and
CRT performance.

General Discussion
In two experiments, we replicated previous findings that
show religious beliefs are negatively correlated with
analytical thinking, but positively correlated with
willingness to endorse teleological explanations. In
addition, we found that analytical thinking is negatively
correlated with willingness to endorse teleological
explanations, and that teleological reasoning mediates the
relationship between analytical style and belief in God.
However, our proposed mechanistic account of why
intuitive thinkers endorse teleological explanations was
not supported.
One limitation of the present studies is their reliance on
correlational data. Future research should attempt to
manipulate individual factors, such as teleological
reasoning and analytical style, to clarify the causal
direction of these effects. Unraveling this complex set of
relations will further our understanding of reflectiveness
and the sources of religious belief.
