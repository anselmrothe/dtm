      There are many definitions for narrative (Bruner, 1991;
Ricoeur, 1980; Labov, 1997). In this study, narrative is defined as
a recounting of events with temporal, evaluative, and contextual
elements.

Example 1 (male, 40s, minimal disability, college educated)
Patient: Um, two weeks ago I had a um, um I guess an episode is what you’d call it. Um where I had a visual problem. I
had kind of a backwards c shape blurry spot, you know in my vision, and it lasted about ten minutes…
Practitioner: Did you have optic neuritis before in that eye? {Uh} 2 Like did you lose vision before? Or have blurry vision
for some time before in that eye?
Patient: Um, I’ve had a what people have told me it’s called a like floater in my eye for a long {uh huh} time. Since like
93, 94. I have like uh like uh I haven’t experienced that kind of loss of field in my eye before. And as I sat there I thought
you know is it the right or the left, so {ok} then I you know closed my right and checked and then closed my left and
checked and it seemed like it was in both, so it didn’t seem like it was in one or the other in particular. And so then I
closed both eyes and you could still like when you sit down and stare at a light bulb you still got that kind of greenish.
Well it was still there…
Practitioner: How big was it?
Patient: Um, it was fairly large. I mean um I guess it was kind of like a field in my vision and I guess if I was looking at
my computer there were certain portions where I was looking where I wouldn’t be able to see what I was typing, because it
would be obscured by the blurriness.
Practitioner:               [Do you get migraines?
Patient: No, I do have headaches but I’ve never experienced what people told me is a migraine…
Patient’s Wife: He had me drive home it scared him that much…
Practitioner: But it lasted only half an hour right?
Patient: I don't even think it lasted that long? I know on Friday it only lasted 10 minutes because when it started I thought
‘well this is unusual’ and I looked at my watch and I wrote down in my notebook…
Practitioner: Cause usually like MS attack would last it has to last more than 24 hours right, so we wouldn’t consider it MS
attack. What you describe to me is not really what sound like {but} MS related problem.
Example 2 (female, late teens, minimal disability, high school educated)
Practitioner: Ok. Difficulty walking? Difficulty with balance?
Patient: there was an episode that I had when I lived with my grandma. She has carpet floors and I got up for school. This
was when I was still in school. I got up for school that morning in my bedroom to get dressed. And when I got up I felt
fine, but when I started to walk I fell and I hit the carpet with my head.
Practitioner: ok, oh really, wow, so you had a fall. Do you get dizzy?
Example 3 (male, 40s, significantly disabled, college educated)
Practitioner: Which medication helps you the best? Pain medication?
Patient: Hydrocodone, the Methadone, the Methadone seemed to help a lot. But when I tried to get off the Methadone,
which I did…It was, it was the worst thing that’s ever happened to me.
Practitioner: What happened?
Patient: Um, my body went into the worst type of shock. Just withdrawal and shock. Uh,uh,uh. I never want to take
anything that my body becomes that reliant on. {yeah} I mean it hurt. It hurt so bad I would lay in home in bed. The
sweats were so bad and I was freezing cold. I had cloths on, a down comforter on, I had a heater blowing on my body, and
I could not get warm and I am just shaking so bad. I was seeing things, got a bad headache. When I go go to the restroom
it was terrible. Didn’t eat, dropped probably about 15 pounds in a week because I didn’t eat any food.
