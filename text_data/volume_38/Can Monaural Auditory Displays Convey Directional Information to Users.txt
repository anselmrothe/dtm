Specifically, we prepared five types of monaural auditory

an experiment to investigate which kinds of displays

   We expect that successful auditory displays can convey
directional information to users without the several
constraints mentioned above, and various auditory displays

              Prepared Auditory Displays
In terms of designing the auditory displays, several studies
argued that “data-to-sound mappings that seem intuitive to a
sound designer may actually result in less effective
performance (Walker & Kramer, 2005),” or “an effective
and practical approach to sonification can only result from
the determination of actual listener preference and                            Figure 2: Leftward/rightward of Set 1
performance (Walker & Lane, 2001).” Therefore, we
decided not to propose the best candidate display set on the
basis of deep deliberation but to prepare the several
candidate sets on the basis of a broad range of possibilities
and explore the best one of them.
   First, we prepared two auditory displays that indicate
upward and downward as continuously increasing and
decreasing pitched sounds, respectively [Figure 1] because
several studies (Pratt, 1930; Roffler & Butler, 1968) showed
strong evidence that “high pitch is consistently mapped to
high positions” and this mapping has been used in various
applications successfully (Meijer, 1992). Concretely, a
triangle wave sound 0.35 s in duration with increasing pitch                   Figure 3: Leftward/rightward of Set 2
