range of stimuli, rather than the magnitude of emotional
expression per se” (p. 318). One such feature was the “size of
the mouth; more happy faces had a larger mouth opening than
less happy faces” (p. 318).
   Although H&L dismiss this confound between emotional
intensity and physical space, it is of concern for two reasons.
First, across cultures, people tend to focus on the mouths of
emotional faces, as much or more than other parts of the face
such as the eyes (Jack et al., 2009; Koda & Ruttkay, 2014; cf,
Blais et al., 2008), and this tendency is particularly strong in
US participants (Jack, Caldara & Shyns, 2012; Yuki,
Maddeux & Masuda, 2007). Second, and crucially, previous
data show that people implicitly spatialize area along a left-
to-right continuum. In one experiment, participants were             Figure 2. Top: Examples of face stimuli used in H&L
