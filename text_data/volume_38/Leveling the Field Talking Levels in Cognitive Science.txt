   Consider Newell’s account, for example. On Newell’s
view, different “cognitive bands” address different sets of
“system levels” – for example, the biological band
addresses the neural circuit system level, while the cognitive
band deals with the deliberate act system level. On Newell’s
view, levels talk functions to describe the organization and
structure of cognition as described by the different system

distinctly ontic role to play in discussion of cognition.
