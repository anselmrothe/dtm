Gentner, 2015). In English, because the use of in denotes
geometric inclusion or containment, it involves greater
ground control than does on (Coventry & Garrod, 2004;
Garrod, et al, 1999).
   Garrod and Sanford (1989) and, more recently, Jamrozik
and Gentner (2015) proposed that the functional relations of
containment and support might be extended to non-spatial
(abstract) uses of in and on (e.g., she´s in a risky situation).
They proposed that the metaphorical use of in and on helps
establish the relative degree of control between an abstract
object (the figure) and an abstract reference object (the
ground).
   A natural proposal that follows from these studies is that
