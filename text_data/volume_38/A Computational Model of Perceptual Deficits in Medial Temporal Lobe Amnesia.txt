Revisiting the Classical, Modular Account of Memory
and Perception Long-term, declarative memory has long
been known to depend on medial temporal lobe (MTL) struc-

1991). However, evidence now suggests an additional role
for MTL in other cognitive functions such as visual percep-               Figure 1: Experiment 3 of Barense et al. (2012). Stimuli

Criterion shift We assume that participants adjust their de-
cision rule as their stimulus representations adapt. That is, if
participants begin to perceive all items as looking more sim-
ilar, they require less evidence to declare that two items are
mismatching. To effect this, the threshold value of novelty
required to declare a pair of items as mismatching (i.e., the
decision criterion) is allowed to shift by setting it equal to the
average of the novelty ('familiarity change') score on the pre-
vious six trials. In addition, for each decision, noise drawn
from the uniform distribution (±1e-6) is added to the thresh-             Figure 4: Figure 4: Simulated data for Experiment 3 of
