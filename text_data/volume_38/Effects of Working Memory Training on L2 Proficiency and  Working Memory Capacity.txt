Self-Paced Reading Task
Reading times exceeding 3 SD from a given subject’s mean
were excluded from analyses, and any subject with a mean
reading time over 800 ms per word was excluded from the
analysis. This resulted in an N of 46, with 23 participants
per training group. Separate 2 (assessment time) x 2
(training condition) x 2 (grammaticality) ANOVAs were
conducted on the reading times at each of the four positions
