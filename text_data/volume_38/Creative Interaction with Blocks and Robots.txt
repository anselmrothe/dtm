    In the current work, we are interested particularly in how
physical action in model making drives design thinking and
in what ways this may differ between experts and novices.
Looking more closely at the kinds of physical actions
defined by Suwa et al (1998), however, we find their action
types ill-suited for describing material interactions in model
making. They distinguish these seven:
    • Revise the shape, size or    •  Write sentences or words
      texture of a depiction       •  Depict a symbol
    • Create a new depiction       •  Look at previous depiction
    • Trace over a depiction on    •  Move a pencil/depiction

 Non-linked interactions occur when subjects pick up

   sequence is a simple non-linked sequence. When the same
   action is performed three or more times on different
   blocks – e.g. Add-Add-Add – we call the sequence
