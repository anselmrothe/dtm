Abstract
In order to creatively interact with robots we need to
understand how creative thinkers work with objects to explore
new ideas physically. Our approach involves comparing the
model-making strategies of architects with students to expose
the creative extras architects bring to working with physical
models. To study this we coded students and architects
performing a design task. Architects differed from students
along three dimensions. First, architects were more selective;
they used fewer blocks overall and fewer variations. Second,
architects appear to think more about spatial relationships and
material constraints. Lastly, architects more often experiment
with re-orientations: they position a block one way to see its
relations to its neighbors; they reposition it another way to see
how that changes how things look and feel. These findings
suggest that designers interact with the material more
effectively than students. This embodied know-how is
something next generation robots can support and possibly
enhance.

Introduction
Much of what has been said of design thinking is about
manual sketching activity: it is the means by which
designers have ‘reflective conversations’ with their design
(Schon, 1992); it is how designers ‘see as’ and ‘see that’
(Goldschmidt, 1991); it situates designers and enables them
to ‘think on the fly’ (Suwa, Purcell, and Gero 1998); and it
enhances a designer’s ability to perceive visual-spatial
features and conceive multiple design ideas (Bilda and
Demirkan, 2003). Indeed, much of design thinking initially
takes form as exploratory sketching activity.
However, sketching is not always necessary in design
activity (Bilda, Gero, and Purcell, 2006) and it is not the
only means of exploring a design manually. Architects also
make physical models, including: sketch models, diagram
models, concept models, massing models, presentation
models, and more (Mills, 2011).
Unlike sketching, which involves marking a twodimensional paper surface, physical model making takes
place in three dimensional space and involves different
forms of material interaction. For instance, different
modeling materials afford different actions: chipboard can
be layered, paper can be folded, wood can be milled,
concrete can be cast, and so forth.
If sketching is thought of as visual design thinking
(Goldschmidt, 1994), model making, with its emphasis on

building, assembly and manipulation, ought to be
considered physical design thinking – a more tangible,
interactionist way of exploring designs.
Framing certain forms of action as enactive thinking is
central to theories of embodied and situated cognition
(Anderson, 2003). Gesture can facilitate thinking in
calculation (Martin, 2005) and problem solving (GoldinMeadow and Beilock (2010). Body movement enables
dancers to probe movement structures in ways inaccessible
through observation alone (Kirsh, 2011).
Our objective here is to extend the notion of design
thinking to physical model making. What sketching is to
visual thinking model making is to physical thinking. To
explore this idea we created a simple design world – a
blocks world – where model making is abstracted to
picking, manipulating, and placing blocks in a configuration
on a site. We devise a simple coding scheme that tracks the
key material interactions over time. By video recording the
design sessions of designers and non-designers we are able
to compare their interactions and by using the method of
voice aloud protocol analysis we can relate these to what is
said during activity. Assuming designers do behave
differently than non-designers, our central concern is to
elucidate a framework that will reveal these differences and
explain them.
Our ultimate motivation is to provide a theoretical and
empirical foundation for interactive robotic design tools that
enhance the material-based nature of exploratory model
making activity. As digital technologies become more
physical – more interactive and integrated into the design
environment – theories of physical design thinking are
needed to guide the development of supportive tools.

Background: Coding Design Activity
Protocol analysis methods have often been used to codify
actions in design activity and correlate them with a
designer’s thoughts.
Coding schemes are used to define and count discrete
actions within design activity. Many studies are based on
Suwa and Tversky’s coding scheme (1997) which identified
four information categories that architects see and think
about while sketching: emergent properties, spatial
relationships, functional relationships and background
knowledge. Suwa et al (1998) adapted these categories to
correspond to the flow of cognitive processes involved in

1253

human cognition: distinguishing physical, perceptual,
functional, and conceptual actions. Physical actions include
drawing, looking, and gesturing. Perceptual actions involve
attending to features, relationships, and making
comparisons. Functional actions include relating non-visual
information with spatial features e.g., circulation of people
through rooms. Conceptual actions involve setting up goals
and making value judgments based on domain knowledge.
By codifying the content of a designer’s actions
researchers have not only been able to speculate on the flow
and structure of design thinking but also to compare novice
and expert behavior. The differences found suggest there are
learned designerly behaviors. Kavakli and Gero (2002)
found structural differences in the behaviors of experts and
novices. They observed that in terms of the overall number
of actions performed during sketching, an expert is more
active and productive than a novice. Furthermore, experts
increased their rate of action over time while novices
decreased theirs. They found that an expert is three times
more selective in how many actions they deal with at once,
suggesting their design process is more controlled and
efficient.
In the current work, we are interested particularly in how
physical action in model making drives design thinking and
in what ways this may differ between experts and novices.
Looking more closely at the kinds of physical actions
defined by Suwa et al (1998), however, we find their action
types ill-suited for describing material interactions in model
making. They distinguish these seven:
• Revise the shape, size or
texture of a depiction
• Create a new depiction
• Trace over a depiction on
same/new sheet

•
•
•
•

Write sentences or words
Depict a symbol
Look at previous depiction
Move a pencil/depiction

In physical model making one may perform these actions
in the course of making a model, e.g. to depict a shape to be
cut out of paper, but this would be a sketching action plus
some other physical action. Strictly speaking, model making
means working with material in hand. The actions possible
depend largely on the type of material, opening up a wide
range of interactions: folding, twisting, laminating, stacking,
sorting, cutting, milling, pouring, and so on. In addition,
model making commonly involves the application of skill
and technique with tools as diverse as knives, drill presses,
laser cutters, and 3D printers. This makes model making as
a general activity cumbersome to analyze in terms of a small
set of simple discrete physical actions.
This complexity may explain why little research has
been conducted on model making as a kind of physical
thinking process. Studies that do examine model making are
highly constrained. For example, to explain the benefit of
hands-on model making in engineering design, Lemons et al
(2010) had participants construct models with Lego bricks.
They focused on their subjects’ accounts of what they were
thinking, using verbal protocols exclusively and did not

code the different physical actions performed such as
joining, disjoining, rotating or sorting bricks.

Methodology
Experiment Setup
In our experiment 9 participants were given 15 minutes to
build a physical model of their dream house by arranging
blocks on a wooden site model (Figure 1). Participants were
supplied with 44 3D printed parallelepiped-shaped blocks
and free to use as many or as few as they wished. The
parallelepiped shape enabled fairly complex assemblies with
varied spatial relationships. No other tools or medium (e.g.
no pencil or paper) was allowed. Prior to the start of the
experiment subjects were given a minute or two to
familiarize themselves with the look and feel of the blocks
and told that during the experiment it would be helpful if
they voiced aloud their thoughts concerning their design or
their process as they manipulated blocks. Video/audio was
captured looking down on the site model and photographs
were taken throughout each session.

Participants
Of the nine participants three were architects with four to
eight years of professional practice as well as teaching
experience at the graduate level. The six student participants
were spilt into two groups. Three students were
undergraduates majoring in architectural design, and three
were undergraduates from non-design related departments.

Hypothesis
Our hypothesis was that in an exploratory design task
requiring physical manipulation, there will be significant
differences between the way architects and students interact
with their materials. The nature of these differences should
be discernable through a coding scheme and connect in
some way with the strategies different skill levels rely on.

Table 3: Definition of Interaction Sequence Types

Coding Scheme
Our coding scheme treats interaction with a block to have
three parts: a picking up step, a manipulating step and a
placement step. Within this broad activity structure or
‘framework’ we distinguish four types of actions and then
seven distinct interaction sequences.

Interaction
Sequence
Non-linked
Repetitive

Primitive Interaction Types There are four interaction
types: adding blocks to a configuration, subtracting blocks
from a configuration, modifying blocks within a
configuration, and relocating blocks across the site. For our
purposes we abstract from details of how a block was
picked up, manipulated and placed and focus instead on
where it came from and where it ends up. Each of these four
types is defined by the locations of the picking and placing
actions as identified in Table 2. For each participant we
counted each occurrence of the action type and measured its
duration.
Interaction Sequences An interaction sequence is an
ordered set of primitive interactions over time. There are
two types of interaction sequences:
• Linked interactions occur when the same block is acted
on two or more times in a row. For example, when a
subject adds a block to a configuration and without really
putting it down, does a modify action (turns it) we say the
two actions are linked. Or when a block is put down then
taken away, even if there is a delay, two actions are
linked.
 Non-linked interactions occur when subjects pick up
different blocks. When the actions are different the
sequence is a simple non-linked sequence. When the same
action is performed three or more times on different
blocks – e.g. Add-Add-Add – we call the sequence
repetitive.
See Table 3 for all interaction sequence definitions.

Results
Despite our small sample size there were important
differences between the three participant groups. At a
structural level there were clear differences in the block
count, block variation, and block arrangement of the final
model. At a protocol level there were suggestive differences
but variance in the quantity of talk aloud results prevented
us from finding anything more than anecdotal differences.
At an interaction level, however, there were clearer
differences in the primitive interaction counts as well as
trends in the interaction sequences across the three groups.

Block Count Architects tended to use fewer blocks in their
completed models than the other two groups. Mean number
of blocks used: architects = 11.0, novices = 17.3 nondesigners = 19.0. Novices and non-designers tended to keep
adding blocks to their configuration until the supply ran out.
Experts seemed to identify a limited set of preferred blocks,
e.g. all red blocks, and then worked with those alone.

1255

Block Variations Similarly, architects used fewer types of
blocks. Of the ten distinct types of blocks: architects used
3.3 types (mean) in their final model, novice student
designers used 6.3 (mean); and non-design students used 7.3
(mean).

Verbal Protocol Analysis
To explain the differences in behavior we looked at the
content of what was said to see if there were differences in
design approaches of the different groups. The key
difference we found is that architects take a more abstract
approach, thinking in broader architectural concepts than
students (as one would expect), whereas students think less
about the spatial and structural properties of shapes and
more concretely about the function of a placement in an
emerging structure. Non-architects seem to explore less and
in a less abstract way.
For example, one novice design student (see subject N1
in Figure 4) described her process as one of using blocks to
represent typical household features – specific functional
units:
“I’m using this [block] as the entrance…and I’m going
to use these [blocks] as the grass and flowers…and these
[wireframe blocks] will be windows”
A non-design student (ND3 in Figure 4). voiced a similar
approach, expressing practical concerns about the house,
commenting that:
“It’d be kind of cool to have a wall of windows along the
side of the house…maybe the south facing side where
there’s a lot of sun”
Furthermore, ND3 was thinking about particular rooms and
how to connect them:
“This is a wide open living room, here’s an open hallway
on the side of the building…the little blocks I’m treating
as hallways and maybe stairs, this is the kitchen, here is
a studio…there’s bedrooms on the second floor.”
Architects had a different approach. They commented on the
how moving shapes around facilitated their exploration of
the spatial relationships between blocks. E2 started off his
design session by saying:
“Using the blocks, I am creating face-matching walls.”
He was giving himself a constraint – joining the blocks
face-to-face – and seeing what relationships became
apparent.
E1 remarked very early on in the session:
“I like that these [the red blocks] create an
‘outdoor/indoor’…a kind of exterior spatial definition
and an interior spatial definition…it’s super strong…and
you don’t have to do much to let them do that…which is
nice” .
He was thinking sculpturally of the external shape of his
model in relation to the site in which it is situated, and
simultaneously thinking about how the blocks seem to
define an interior space that is confronted differently by
someone on the inside. The same architect emphasized that
he conceptualized the inside too in a more abstract manner,

“I can’t go through it and say what’s my bedroom,
what’s my living room…but as a plain figure I like it and
can imagine it occupied in many ways.”
Architects seem to use the blocks to visually and
kinesthetically fish for abstract structural ideas and
relations. They don’t have a clear idea of what they might
be making first and then assemble blocks to see if it works.
Rather, they use the blocks to throw up ideas that they can
evaluate as interesting or not.

Interaction Results
To determine whether expertise was revealed in other
quantitative measures we first coded each participant’s
video session in terms of primitive interactions (Add,
Subtract, Modify, or Relocate), looked for differences in
summary statistics, and then analyzed sequences. In Table 4
we show the number of times each action was performed by
a subject and the percentage of all actions that action
represents. E.g. E2 performed 27 Add actions; these
accounted for 24.5% of all of his interactions.
There was huge variance. Total number of actions for the
nine subjects range from 44 to 162. These counts vary
across and within each group and depend largely on the
amount of time spent in the task. Total time spent acting on
blocks for each participant ranges from 113 to 429 seconds.
We did a Chi-Square analysis to test the null hypothesis
that that there is no significant relationship between
participant group and interaction count. The result is x2(6,
n=9) = 32.22 p < .01. This low probability is sufficient to
reject the null hypothesis. But what is the relationship?
Owing to the small sample size and significant
individual differences results were suggestive but
inconclusive at the summary level. Figure 4 reveals that
both architects and novice architectural students perform
Modify actions more often than Relocate actions. For
instance, they will position a block one way in relation to its
neighbors and see what it looks like; reposition it another
way and see what that looks like, and so forth. This has the
effect of displaying more block relationships. Non-design
students, on the other hand, interact with blocks more often
on an individual basis, isolated from a developing
configuration. Non-designers seem to experiment less.

Interaction Sequences
Differences between architects and all other subjects show
up more clearly when we look at sequences of action.
Overall, architects spend a greater percentage of their block
activity performing linked interactions than both novices
and non-designers, and suggestively novice designers
likewise perform more linked actions than non-designers:
architects 60.7%, novices 50.8%, and non-designers 43.8%
(Figure 5). That is, action spent thinking and manipulating
the same block varies with expertise, the more expert the
more actions on the same block. This is consistent with the
tendency to experiment. Looking Figure 6, there is a clear
trend correlating expertise and the tendency to test and
reject a placement, and test and eject a placement.

Discussion
Figure 5: Percentage of Linked Interactions
Architects perform over two times as many Reject
interaction sequences and over three times as many Eject
sequences compared to non-design students. It seems the
architects are more selective when choosing which blocks to
keep in the model.
This also correlates with the tendency to devote less
activity to managing and assembling blocks. Non-design
students perform Assemble interaction sequences seven
times as much as the architects. On the whole, architects,
more so than the other groups, employ interaction strategies
which link longer chains of related interactions.

Robots are becoming increasingly available to architects
and designers. So far their role is to help build parts and
assemble models. Why not integrate them in the early
exploratory stage of design (Figure 7)?
The challenge in bringing robots in as cognitive
collaborators and not just as hired hands, is that joint action
normally requires collaborators to know what each other is
doing. That is still a long way off. But as our study has
shown, architectural designers interact with physical
material in characteristic ways – certainly in ways that are
distinguishable from students. These can be coded in terms
of primitives and sequences and as more regularities are
discovered a theory of ‘thinking through material
interaction’ may become the framework through which
designers may creatively work with robots.

correlate with design experience. Architects more than
novices and more than non-design students use more time
exploring through manipulating and reflecting on the
possibilities of each block, than on placing a block down
and rushing off to get another block.
A blocks world is inevitably a limited design world. We
believe our results are suggestive enough, however, to show
that subjects use blocks to think with. If our goal is to
develop robotic cognitive assistants frameworks such as
ours will need to be further developed and elaborated.

Figure 7: Vision for an interactive robotic arm
Equipped with vision sensors and object recognition
functionality, robotic tools could observe a designer’s
material interactions and track the emerging structure of his
or her model. At first the value of this tracking would be to
support low cost undoing or duplication. A robot could
quickly duplicate interactions or perform iterations and
variations of the designer’s moves, enabling rapid
prototyping of variations or construction of symmetric
configurations. But additionally, a robot can be used to
compute complex arrangements that are hard to imagine and
difficult to manually configure, such as assembling block
arrays or reflections. This will be especially beneficial as
materials themselves become more designed and complex.
A robotic partnership could expand the visualization and
manipulation capacities of architects and give room for new
thoughts.

Conclusion
In order to understand how architects work with physical
objects to visually and kinesthetically explore design
possibilities, we gave architects, architecture students and
non-design students a task to build a model of their dream
house. Their design environment was a 4’ square site with
contours and a set of forty-four different shaped, sized and
colored blocks. We devised a coding scheme to analyze the
material interactions of designers and this world based on
three basic actions: picking, manipulating, and placing
blocks on the site. Using this scheme we were able to
distinguish the interactions exhibited by architects from
novice students and non-design students.
Our main observation is that architects more than student
architects seem to materially explore their design in an
abstract manner at first, looking for interesting structural
relations between the site and collections of blocks. They
also consider other architectural concepts such as negative
space. Student architects and non-design students are far
more functional and pragmatic, placing blocks down to
serve as living rooms or kitchens, and other familiar parts of
houses. This difference in concern leads architects to
experiment with space differently.
Our second observation is that the amount of activity
spent experimenting and fishing for new ideas, seems to
