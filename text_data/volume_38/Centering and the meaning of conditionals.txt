allowing a comparison between these theories. In particular,
centering is valid for the probability conditional (Over, in
press; Pfeifer & Kleiter, 2010), but invalid for the
inferential conditional (Douven, 2015a; Skovgaard-Olsen,
Singmann, & Klauer, in press). We will focus on these two
theories in the following.

Abstract
The centering inference - p & q, therefore if p then q - is
important in reasoning research because it is logically valid
for some accounts of conditionals (e. g. the material and the
probability conditionals), but not for others (e. g. the
inferential conditional, according to which a conditional is
true if and only if there is an inferential connection between p
and q). We tested participants' acceptance of centering
compared to valid and invalid inferences not containing
conditionals, varying the presence of an inferential connection
and of a common topic of discourse between p and q.
Participants' acceptance of centering was more similar to
valid inferences than to invalid inferences, and there was no
reliable effect of a connection between p and q. Acceptance
rates were higher when there was a common topic of
discourse, independently of the type of inference. The
findings support the probability conditional account.

The probability conditional

Keywords: validity; uncertainty; conditionals; centering

Introduction
Conditional sentences of the form if p then q, like "If it is
snowing, then the streets are slippery", are used on a daily
basis in ordinary discourse and in science. And yet there is
still not a consensus on their meaning. They are central to
any account of reasoning, because every inference from p to
q can be rephrased as a conditional. Our understanding of
the meaning of conditionals therefore goes hand in hand
with our understanding of reasoning processes as a whole
(Over & Cruz, in press).
Most reasoning takes place from premises that are not
certain, but are held only with higher or lower degrees of
belief. This uncertainty affects the inferences people draw,
and therefore has to be taken into account in theories of
reasoning (Evans & Over, 2004, 2013; Oaksford & Chater,
2007, 2013; Pfeifer & Kleiter, 2009, 2011). Classical logic,
with its restriction to the binary values of truth and falsity,
cannot represent uncertainty, but this becomes possible with
the use of probability theory (Adams, 1998; Coletti &
Scozzafava, 2002; de Finetti, 1936/1995; Gilio, 2002;
Ramsey, 1926/1994; Jeffrey, 1991).
One inference that has not been studied much in the
psychology of reasoning is centering (or conjunctive
sufficiency): inferring if p then q from p & q. Centering is
important because it is logically valid for several theories of
the conditional (Evans & Over, 2004; Girotto & JohnsonLaird, 2004; Lewis, 1973; Pfeifer & Kleiter, 2010;
Stalnaker, 1968), and logically invalid for several others
(Douven, 2015a; Cariani & Rips, in press; Kratzer, 2012)

If people interpret a natural language conditional as a
probability conditional, then their degree of belief in the
conditional is the conditional probability of its consequent
given its antecedent: P(if p then q) = P(q|p). This equality is
called The Equation as a normative philosophical proposal
(Edgington, 1995). The psychological hypothesis that
people's interpretation of conditionals conforms to the
Equation is called the conditional probability hypothesis
(Evans & Over, 2004). It is proposed that people compute
this conditional probability by performing a Ramsey test: a
mental simulation in which they hypothetically assume p to
be the case, make any changes to their beliefs that may be
necessary to preserve consistency, and assess the probability
of q on this basis (Evans & Over, 2004; Ramsey,
1929/1994; Stalnaker, 1968). An inferential connection
between p and q may influence people's assessment of the
conditional probability, but the effect of such a relation is
procedural and pragmatic and not part of the semantics of
conditionals.

The inferential conditional
Inferentialism states that a high conditional probability,
P(q|p) is high, is not sufficient for the conditional to have a
high probability, P(if p then q) is high. For the conditional
to have a high probability, there also has to be an inferential
connection between p and q. Of course, P(q|p) can be high
because P(q) is high and q is independent of p, but this is
not sufficient to make P(if p then q) high for inferentialism.
In the strongest version of the theory, a conditional is
proposed to be true if and only if there is a strong enough
argument from p (plus relevant background knowledge) to
q, where this argument can be deductive, inductive, or
abductive (Douven, 2015a; Krzyżanowska, Wenmackers, &
Douven, 2014; c. f. Douven, 2015b). A deductive argument
is assumed to be present when q is necessarily true given the
truth of p (because for instance p is a subset of q). An
abductive argument is assumed to be present when p is the
best explanation for q (Douven & Verbrugge, 2010). It is

1104

held that "q is an inductive consequence of p (given the
background premises) iff q follows with high statistical
probability from p (in light of the background premises)"
(Krzyżanowska et al., p. 775; c. f. Douven & Verbrugge,
2010, p. 303). If taken literally, this criterion implies that a
high conditional probability is sufficient for a conditional to
be highly probable. We therefore take the authors to mean
that an inductive argument is present not only when the
conditional probability of q given p is statistically high, but
when in addition it is higher than the unconditional
probability of q, that is, when p raises the probability of q
(c. f. Douven, 2008, Oaksford & Chater, 2007, and the use
of the delta-p rule in research on causation, as in Cheng,
1997).
This definition of an inferential conditional in terms of the
binary values of truth and falsity has not been extended to
degrees of belief. But if we make the uncontroversial
assumption that degrees of belief are degrees of belief that a
statement is true, or true given that it has a truth value, and
no further qualification is added to the inferentialist
definition, then this definition seems to imply that the
degree of belief in a conditional is a direct function of the
strength of an inferential connection between p and q.
A less strong variant of inferentialism integrates the
requirement for a connection with the conditional
probability hypothesis. It proposes that people assume by
default that a conditional has a connection, operationalized
as a positive covariation between p and q when using
naturalistic materials. If this assumption is met, then people
set their degree of belief in the conditional to that of the
conditional probability. If the assumption that there is a
connection is not met, then people "penalize" the value of
the conditional probability by adjusting it downwards
(Skovgaard-Olsen et al., in press; c. f. Douven, 2008). In
virtue of its contingent nature, this "penalty" is arguably a
pragmatic adjustment rather than a semantic requirement,
but its supporters hold that it is semantic.

Previous findings
The Equation has received strong and consistent empirical
support (Evans, Handley, & Over, 2003; Fugard, Pfeifer,
Mayerhofer, & Kleiter, 2011; Oberauer & Wilhelm, 2003;
Politzer, Over, & Baratgin, 2010), but there has been little
empirical research on inferentialism. Some studies have
found an effect of a covariation between p and q on people's
belief in conditionals (Oaksford & Chater, 2010; Oaksford,
Chater, & Larkin, 2000; Skovgaard-Olsen et al., in press),
while others have not (Oberauer, Weidenfeld, & Fischer,
2007; Over, Hadjichristidis, Evans, Handley, & Sloman,
2007; Singmann, Klauer, & Over, 2014). Oberauer et al.
(2007) found that the presence of a causal connection
affected people's belief in a conditional in the absence of
explicit frequency information on the conditional
probability. However, when frequency information was
given, the effect of a causal connection was negligible. This
suggests that information on a connection is relevant for
estimating the conditional probability, but unnecessary

when this probability is already known. Moreover,
inferentialism, unlike the probability conditional hypothesis,
is not in accordance with truth table tasks (Baratgin, Over,
& Politzer, 2013; Evans et al., 2003; Oberauer & Wilhelm,
2003), where people hold the conditional to be true when p
and q are true, and where they judge the probability of the
conditional to be a function of P(q|p). In these tasks, the
materials, which would indicate the presence or absence of a
connection, remain constant (Over & Cruz, in press).
Proponents of inferentialism have argued that such studies
do not undermine their proposal because of the use in them
of abstract or pseudo-naturalistic conditionals, and that the
scope of their theory is restricted to naturalistic conditionals
(Skovgaard-Olsen et al., in press). They have also pointed
out that a distinction is made in linguistics between content
and inferential conditionals, and their theory is restricted to
the latter. It also does not apply to so-called Peter-Pan
conditionals, e.g. "If fairies exist, then I am Peter Pan", or
non-interference conditionals, which are types of
conditionals that explicitly lack an inferential connection
(Douven & Verbrugge, 2010; Krzyżanowska et al., 2014).
One problem for inferentialism is that such restrictions
reduce its falsifiability, and expose it to the danger of
providing ad hoc explanations for data.

The present experiment
As described above, both variants of inferentialism assume
that the role of a connection is semantic and not pragmatic.
They conceive of the connection as a necessary component
of what makes a linguistic form a conditional and not some
other kind of statement. To test this assumption, we draw on
a conception of validity from test theory. Note that this
notion of (test) "validity" is different from the logical
validity of an argument or inference. In test theory, a test is
said to be "valid" when it is sensitive enough to measure the
construct it is designed to measure, and when it is specific
enough not to measure much else in addition to the
construct. In analogy to this, we consider there to be
evidence that the effect of a connection is semantic when it
is present across conditionals of different types and
contents, and when it is specific to conditionals, or at least
stronger for conditionals than for other connectives.
Regarding sensitivity, we already mentioned above the
restriction in scope of inferentialism, which makes it seem
unwarranted to assert it as a theory of the meaning of
conditionals in general, without further qualification. Here
we focus on specificity: That the effect of a connection is
specific or at least higher for conditionals than for other
connectives. We therefore compare people's degree of belief
in centering with people's degree of belief in inferences not
containing conditionals, the logical validity (invalidity) of
which is much less controversial.
If an effect of a connection were to be present to a similar
degree for inferences with and without conditionals, then
inferentialism would have no means to distinguish
conditionals from other connectives, unless it reduced, in its

1105

less strong version, to the conditional probability
hypothesis.
To illustrate the problem with unconnected conditionals,
proponents of inferentialism often use examples like "If
Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016, the earth weighs
more than 2 kilograms." (Krzyżanowska et al., 2014).
Referring to this example, the authors state "antecedent and
consequent have nothing to do with each other, which at
least on our hypothesis accounts for the felt falsity of this
sentence." The sentence indeed sounds odd, but it not only
expresses no inferential connection. As the authors say,
antecedent and consequent have nothing to do with each
other: they belong to different topics. This raises the
question of whether the intuitive oddness of such sentences
comes from the absence of an inferential connection, or
alternatively from the absence of a common topic of
discourse. To assess this question, we compared people's
degree of belief in inferences under three conditions: (1) one
in which there is a connection between p and q, (2) one in
which there is no connection, but a common topic of
discourse, and (3) one in which there is no connection and
no common topic of discourse.

Amri bird you see on Liaku will eat arb seeds" and "The
next Amri bird you see on Liaku will build its nests on arb
trees"). In group 2 (the no connection – same topic
condition) p and q referred to different features of two
different birds (e. g. "The next Amri bird you see on Liaku
will eat arb seeds" and "The next Grauk bird you see on
Liaku will live in groups"). In group 3 (the no connection –
different topic condition) p and q referred to different topics
(e. g. "The next Amri bird you see on Liaku will eat arb
seeds" and "The Grauk province of Raimos will increase
taxes"). The materials were pretested for the extent to which
people perceived there to be a connection between p and q
(median ratings in percent: 78, 19, and 1 for groups 1 to 3,
respectively). Participants were randomly allocated to one
of the three groups.
Each participant gave ratings to the six inferences
displayed in Table 1.

Method
Participants
A total of 670 participants from English speaking countries
completed the online experiment. Following methodological
recommendations for online research (Aust, Diedenhofen,
Ullrich, & Musch, 2013; Reips, 2002), we excluded cases
with repeated IP address; cases who failed a test question
assessing whether they were reading the materials presented
to them or just clicking through; cases who indicated at the
end of the experiment that they did not take part seriously;
cases with one or more trial reaction times of less than 3
seconds; and cases who rated their English language skills
as not being high or that of a native speaker. The final
sample consisted of 363 participants, reporting a mean age
of 42.56 (range: 15-80) and a diverse formal educational
background. They received a compensation of $ 0.16 for
their participation.

Materials and design
Participants were asked to imagine that they were
researchers investigating the birds of the invented island of
Liaku, and also that they were following the election results
in their far away home country Raimos. On each trial,
participants were shown a short context story, followed by a
one-premise inference. They were asked to assume that they
had a specific degree of belief in the premise of the
inference, and were asked to judge how confident they
could reasonably be in the conclusion, given this degree of
belief in the premise. Participants gave their answer by
writing a percentage into a box.
Each participant was shown materials from one of three
conditions. In group 1 (the connection condition) p and q
referred to two features of the same bird (e. g. "The next

Inference 1 is centering, whose validity differs between
theories of the conditional. Inference 2 is its converse, and is
more uncontroversially invalid. The remaining inferences
do not contain conditionals. Inferences 3 and 5 are more
uncontroversially valid, and inferences 4 and 6 are more
uncontroversially invalid. We will refer to inferences 2 to 6
simply as valid resp. invalid in what follows.
Each inference was presented three times, showing a
premise probability of 1, .8 and .2, respectively. The
materials in which the inferences were embedded were
different on each trial. The allocation of materials to
inferences, as well as the trial order, was varied randomly
for each participant.
The experiment was conducted in a single online session
using the platform CrowdFlower(c), and took 8.4 min on
average to complete.

Results and discussion
As expected, participants' ratings of conclusion probability
were lower for lower premise probabilities. However, the
pattern of responses for the variables of interest to the
hypotheses was very similar across premise probabilities. In
particular, there was no qualitative difference in responses
to inferences with certain and with uncertain premises.
Because we had no specific prediction about effects of
premise probability, which we varied merely to increase the
generalizability of the findings, subsequent results were
aggregated across this variable.

To test whether centering is generally treated as valid, and
whether its treatment as valid depends on the presence of a
connection and/or of a common topic of discourse between
p and q, we first compared inference 1 (centering) with
inference 2 (its converse). We next compared inference 1
with the average ratings for valid inferences 3 and 5.
Finally, we compared inference 1 with the average ratings
for invalid inferences 4 and 6. The results are displayed in
Figure 1.

slightly lower than the conclusion of the two valid
inferences. However, the effect was not reliable: it did not
reach significance when analyzed individually in any of the
groups (for group 1, t < 1; for group 2, t = 1.39, p = .17,
95%CI [-3.7, .65]; for group 3, t = 1.86, p = .07, 95%CI [4.9, .15]). There is therefore little evidence for a treatment
of centering as invalid.

Centering vs. its converse A mixed ANOVA with group
(1, 2, 3) as between subjects factor and inference (1, 2) as
within subjects factor led to a significant effect of inference,
F(1, 360) = 18.46, p < .001, ηp2 = .049: ratings for inference
1 were higher (M = 62.90, SE =.71) than ratings for
inference 2 (M = 59.03, SE =.86). There was also a
significant effect of group, F(1, 360) = 3.55, p = .03, ηp2 =
.019; but no interaction between inference and group (F <
1). Follow-up analyses for the effect of group revealed that
ratings for group 3 (M = 58.66, SE = 1.14) were lower than
for group 1 (M = 62.49, SE = 1.18), F(1, 257) = 5.46, p =
.02, ηp2 = .021. Ratings for group 3 were marginally lower
than for group 2 (M = 61.75, SE = 1.17), F(1, 236) = 3.95, p
= .048, ηp2 = .016; but there was no significant difference
between ratings for group 1 and for group 2 (F < 1).
The finding of higher ratings of conclusion probability for
centering than for its converse, regardless of the presence or
absence of a connection, is inconsistent with inferentialism.
Inferentialism would have predicted an interaction between
inference and group, such that ratings are lower for
centering than for the other inferences in the groups with no
connection. The finding that the effect of group could be
traced back to the effect of a common topic of discourse, but
not to the presence of a connection, is also not in accordance
with inferentialism.

inferences investigated, separately for group 1 (connection),
group 2 (no connection – same topic) and group 3 (no
connection – different topic). The black line represents the
target inference of centering. Green lines represent the valid
and red lines the invalid comparison inferences. Error bars
show 95% CI.

Centering vs. valid inferences 3 and 5 A mixed ANOVA
with group (1, 2, 3) as between subjects factor and inference
(1, 3&5) as within subjects factor led to a small main effect
of inference, F(1, 360) = 4.73, p = .03, ηp2 = .013: ratings
for inference 1 (M = 62.90, SE = .71) were lower than mean
ratings for inferences 3 and 5 (M = 64.57, SE = .55). There
was also a main effect of group, F(1, 360) = 3.82, p = .023,
ηp2 = .021. Inference and group did not interact (F < 1).
Follow-up analyses to the effect of group showed that
ratings were lower for group 3 (M = 62.08, SE = .88) than
for group 1 (M = 65.37, SE = .91), F(1, 257) = 6.79, p = .01,
ηp2 = .026. There was no difference in ratings between
groups 1 and 2, F(1, 227) = 1.73, p = .19, ηp2 = .008; nor
between groups 2 and 3, F(1, 236) = 1.92, p = .17, ηp2 =
.008.
The absence of an interaction between inference and
group is again contrary to the predictions of inferentialism,
as is the finding that the effect of group could be traced back
to the effect of a common topic of discourse, but not to the
effect of a connection. The small effect of inference
indicates that people rated the conclusion of centering

Centering vs. invalid inferences 4 and 6 A mixed
ANOVA with group (1, 2, 3) as between subjects factor and
inference (1, 4&6) as within subjects factor led to a main
effect of inference, F(1, 360) = 232.88, p < .001, ηp2 = .393:
mean ratings for inferences 4 and 6 (M = 47.38, SE = .88)
were lower than for inference 1 (M = 62.90, SE = .71).
There was also a main effect of group, F(1, 360) = 3.61, p =
.028, ηp2 = .020; but no interaction between inference and
group (F < 1). Follow-up analyses to the effect of group
revealed that ratings for group 3 (M = 53.04, SE = 1.01)
were lower than for group 1 (M = 56.88, SE = 1.04), F(1,
257) = 6.39, p = .012, ηp2 = .024. There was no significant
difference between group 1 and group 2 (for group 2: M =
55.50, SE = 1.14) (F < 1), nor between groups 2 and 3, F(1,
236) = 2.61, p = .108, ηp2 = .011.
The difference between centering and the mean of the
invalid inferences 4 and 6 was reliably present (for group 1,
t = 8.23, p < .001, 95%CI [12.1,19.7]; for group 2, t = 9.08,
p < .001, 95%CI [11.7, 18.2]; for group 3, t = 9.69, p < .001,
95%CI [12.5,18.9]). Ratings for centering were more
similar to those for valid inferences (difference: M = -1.67,

1107

SE = 0.8) than to those for invalid inferences (difference: M
= 15.52, SE = 1.0), F(1, 360) = 290.94, p < .001, ηp2 = .447,
irrespective of group (F < 1).
The finding that centering was treated as a logically valid
rather than as an invalid inference is at odds with theories of
the conditional that reject centering. The consistent absence
of an interaction between inference and group, as well as the
finding that the effect of group could be traced back to that
of a common topic of discourse, but not to that of a
connection, is at odds with the predictions of inferentialism
more specifically.
We repeated the above analyses using a linear mixed
model with a random intercept for participants, finding the
same pattern of significant and non-significant results. The
model failed to converge when attempting to introduce a
random slope for participants, or a random intercept and/or
slope for item contents. We report the ANOVA here for
reasons of space.

General discussion
We investigated whether people treat centering as a
logically valid inference, comparing it to inferences not
containing conditionals, and whether people's acceptance of
centering depends on the presence of a connection or
common topic of discourse between p and q. We found
centering to be treated more like a logically valid inference
than like an invalid one, irrespective of the presence of a
connection or of a common topic of discourse. Centering
was accepted less when there was no common topic of
discourse, but was not accepted less when there was no
connection. The effect of a common topic of discourse was
not specific to centering, but occurred to a similar degree for
inferences not containing conditionals.
These findings are not in line with theories implying that
centering is logically invalid for the natural language
conditional, and not with inferentialism more specifically.
They suggest that what matters for the intuition that there is
something odd in conditionals like "If Hillary Clinton runs
for president in 2016, the earth weighs more than 2
kilograms", is the absence of a common topic of discourse
between p and q, rather than the absence of a specific
connection. Further, this intuition does not seem to be
specific to conditionals, but appears to apply similarly to
inferences with disjunctions and conjunctions, suggesting
that the effect is pragmatic and not semantic. If it were
semantic, then the stronger version of inferentialism would
be unable to distinguish conditionals from other
connectives, and the less strong version would reduce to the
conditional probability hypothesis.
The suggestion that conditionals with no connection are
odd for pragmatic reasons is in accordance with previous
findings in support of the conditional probability hypothesis
(Evans et al., 2003; Oberauer & Wilhelm, 2003); with
findings in support of centering, albeit without varying the
presence of a connection (Cruz, Baratgin, Oaksford, &
Over, 2015; Politzer & Baratgin, 2015); and with evidence
for the role of a connection when using conditionals in the

pragmatic context of argumentation (Hahn & Oaksford,
2007).
The present findings are preliminary, however, and
require replication and extension before allowing stronger
conclusions. One point to consider is that the presence of a
connection was varied between subjects in this experiment.
This was important because it allowed us to avoid
participants reacting to the variation of a connection simply
because of its salience in the materials, making them think
the experimenter expects them to respond differentially
towards it. However, a variation within subjects would
make it easier to find an effect of group, and thus also easier
to find the interaction predicted by inferentialism. Further,
the materials used here were pseudonaturalistic. It would be
informative to test whether the findings can be generalized
to naturalistic scenarios.
If subsequent research provides further evidence against
inferentialism, this would undermine the generality of the
inferentialist proposal. However, it would not invalidate it
as such. To take the causal domain as an example, there are
certainly statements of the form p causes q, which are true
when p causes q, and false otherwise. Such statements do
not necessarily change their truth conditions when they are
rephrased as if p then q. Moreover, there is likely to be a
continuum in the extent to which a conditional is meant to
assert the presence of a causal or other kind of relation.
However, to the extent that a conditional is meant to
assert p causes q, it can perhaps be considered general as
opposed to singular (Cruz & Oberauer, 2014). General
conditionals are useful because they allow us to build
theories about the world, to help us understand it and make
predictions (Chater & Oaksford, 2013). Sometimes we are
looking for information that is relevant for refining our
theories about the world. But other times we just want to
make a prediction of what is the case in a particular
instance, regardless of why it is the case. For example, we
might sometimes want to know whether mosquito bites
really cause a certain illness. At other times, we might be
satisfied with learning simply that the conditional
probability of the illness is high given mosquito bites, to
take quick and easy measures against the bites. Sometimes a
connection may be used as a predictor for the conditional
probability, and sometimes the converse may hold. Whether
a connection or the conditional probability is more basic
may depend on the goals of the reasoner. In this way, a
narrower scope for inferentialism in the context of singular
indicative conditionals could imply a wider scope for it in
the context of generals and counterfactuals.
