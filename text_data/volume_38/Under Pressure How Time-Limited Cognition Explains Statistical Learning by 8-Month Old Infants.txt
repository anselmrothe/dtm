 too), the order of test word presentation for each simulated
 participant was not varied over the entire simulation. We as-
 sume this consideration was also afforded by SAN; however,
 there is no information regarding this.
    We approximated the headturn preference procedure as fol-
 lows: as in SAN’s study, test word presentation occurred con-
 tinuously. However, unlike SAN’s study, presentation ended
 if the simulated participant either recognised the test word or
 the test word was not recognised after 15 seconds from first
 presentation; the presentation time length was then recorded.
 This strategy allows for direct testing of the headturn pref-
 erence procedure’s proposal that novel (unrecognised) stim-
 uli causes perceptual fixation. It also allows us to investigate
 whether there is evidence to posit that the participant’s fixa-
 tion on a speaker in SAN’s study is an indicator of the partici-
 pant’s engagement in discrimination or familiarisation. Since                                  (a) r2 values.
 learning in our simulations is analogous to a participant fix-
 ating on a speaker in SAN’s study, if the presentation times
 recorded in our simulations are a good fit to the looking times
 recorded in SAN’s study, this hypothesis could be accepted.
    We first report results obtained with default CHREST
 values for discrimination (10000ms) and familiarisation
 (2000ms); trace decay in the phonological store is set to
 600ms (as justified earlier). We then report the results of a
 grid search aimed at finding the optimal values for these three
 parameters. In 27 simulations, each repeated 50 times, sim-
 ulated participants were set-up with a unique combination of
 values for the three parameters mentioned:
 • Phonological store trace decay: 600ms, 800ms, 1000ms
 • Discrimination: 8000ms, 9000ms, 10000ms
 • Familiarisation: 1000ms, 1500ms, 2000ms                                       (b) Root mean squared error (RMSE) values.
