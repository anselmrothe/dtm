test word learning by asking children, “Point to the grimp,”
instead of, “Which creature did they see?”
   This research provides suggestive evidence that children
may use what they do and do not know to propel their
vocabulary acquisition and adults’ question asking might
support preschoolers’ metacognitive abilities.
