talking to other children, we saw overhearing adult-directed

   The current study also improves upon previous investiga-
tions of overhearing by increasing the number of learning tar-

have access to will contain not one, but many words which

Test Phase The test phase was identical in both conditions,
and consisted of three blocks of six trials each. These 18 test
trials were presented in one of two pseudorandom orders,
one the reverse of the other. The first two blocks tested
word-learning, while the third tested learning of facts. On
each trial, the child was asked to place the toy associated
with a particular word or fact into a container, which varied
by block (i.e., “Can you put the zav / one I found in the
garden in the bowl/box/hat?”). Responses were recorded and
coded for correctness. Children who failed trials requesting
familiar objects by name were excluded. At the end of the
test phase, the experimenter asked the child to identify her
favorite toy, and noted her response.
Videocoding Videos of sessions in the Overhearing condi-
tion were coded in Datavyu to analyze children’s behavior
during the experimenter’s phone call. The experimenter’s
speech was coded into segments distinguishing the social
portions of the call from the learning-related content of the       Figure 2: Experiment 1 mean accuracy at test by learning
