therefore to assess the contamination of perceptual similarity
judgments by semantic category knowledge, and test whether
this contamination is attenuated by inversion.
The Present Study
The choice to test whether inversion attenuates the influence
of semantic category knowledge on perceptual similarity
judgments was motivated by numerous findings that rotation
away from a canonical orientation impedes the identification
of the category to which a familiar item belongs (e.g.,
Jolicoeur & Milliken, 1989; Lawson & Jolicoeur, 2003).
Specifically, increasing misorientation both slows and
increases errors for identifying an item’s category label. This           Figure 1. Examples of triads in each condition. A)

effects of the Semantic Conflict and Orientation factors on
accuracy and RT using repeated measures ANOVAs.
Specifically, for each outcome measure, we calculated each
participant’s mean score for the four combinations of
conditions produced by our Semantic Conflict and
Orientation factors, and submitted these mean scores to
separate repeated measures ANOVAs for each age group.
Accuracy Analysis
For adult participants, this analysis revealed a main effect of
Semantic Conflict (F(1,23)=10.122, p=.004, ɳ2=.306), and a
main effect of Orientation (F(1,23)=6.457, p=.018, ɳ2=.219).
More importantly, both main effects were qualified by a
significant interaction (F(1,23)=15.826, p=.001, ɳ2=.408).
To explore this interaction, we conducted t-tests comparing
Upright versus Inverted RTs separately for the Conflict and
No Conflict conditions. In the Conflict condition, adults were
more accurate on Inverted (Maccuracy=89.96%) than on                       Figure 2. Accuracy and RT outcomes. Upright trials are
