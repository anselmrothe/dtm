Accompanying text explained that the correct sum for
fraction addition would be the same magnitude as the
combined magnitudes of the addends. The instruction
included brief multiple-choice and free-response questions
to check that students had read the text. This instruction was
intended to shake students’ confidence in the incorrect
whole number strategy, and did not demonstrate the full
fraction addition procedure. Students in the procedure-and-
magnitude intervention saw depictions of the magnitudes of
the addends and sums in the example equations. This
depiction was intended to reinforce that a correct sum would
equal the combined magnitudes of the addends, while an
incorrect sum would not. These depictions were linear

students arrive at the correct evaluation of whether or not a
