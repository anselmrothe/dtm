                   General Discussion
The Colavita visual dominance effect (Colavita, 1974) has
been robustly replicated in the literature for the past several
decades (see for example, Ngo et al., 2010; Sinnett et al.,
2007; Spence et al., 2012 for a review). Indeed, while Ngo
et al. (2011) did manage to reverse the effect (only under
extreme conditions), it was not until recently (Robinson et
al., 2016) that visual dominance has been consistently               Figure 5. Cardiac responses across time. Error Bars denote SEs,
