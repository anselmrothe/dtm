implementation of the paradigm (Minda & Miles, 2010)
categorization stimuli are comprised of three binary valued
dimensions: Shape (square vs. triangle), color (black vs.
white), and size (big vs. small).
   The basic finding of the Shepard et al. (1961) study was
that the order of difficulty of the six types (as assessed by
participants' performance) cannot be accounted for by a
simple stimulus-generalization theory. The key finding was
that participants found it easier to learn Type II categories
compared to Type IV categories, despite the reduced within-
category similarity of the former (compared to the latter)
category structure. The authors suggested that this Type II
over Type IV advantage necessitates considering the
mediation of executive attention mechanisms and the
formulation and application of rules during category
learning.
