that labels affect visual attention. Moreover, the research di-
rectly examining infants’ and children’s fixations while learn-
ing categories are mixed (Althaus & Plunkett, 2015b; Best et
al., 2011). Therefore, the current study examined the effects
of common and unique labels on adults’ category learning.
   Previous research suggests that for adults, labels are not
just perceptual features (Yamauchi & Markman, 2000). Fur-
thermore, adults optimize their attention to focus on category
relevant features (Blair, Watson, & Meier, 2009; Hoffman &
Rehder, 2010). Will adults who are experts in language learn-

features when every member of the to-be-learned category is
associated with a unique label? To address these questions,
