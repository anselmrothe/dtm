Coding: Parent and Child Sensorimotor Behaviors
Gaze Coding. At the end of play, we calibrated both
toddlers’ and parents’ eye trackers by having them fixate to
known locations on the table (see Yu & Smith, 2013 for a
detailed explanation of calibration). Based on the calibration
data, eye-tracking software produced frame-by-frame point-
of-gaze estimates, as indicated by the cross-hairs in Figure
1. Eye tracking spatial accuracy is about 30 once calibrated
(see Franchak et al., 2011).
   Using footage from the first-person scene camera (with
cross-hair superimposed) and the eye camera (which depicts
moment-by-moment eye movements), coders manually
annotated the whole session frame-by-frame for parents’
and toddlers’ target of gaze. For each frame, gaze was coded
as one of five possibilities: each of the three toy objects, the
partner’s face, or elsewhere.
Manual Activity Coding. Coders also watched the session
from multiple angles (first-person scene cameras, third-
person view cameras) and annotated the session frame-by-
frame for moments when toddlers and parents touched each
of the three objects. Figure 3 depicts a representative time

Joint Engagement in Extended vs. Short Discourse
To examine the social correlates underlying extended verbal
discourse, we asked whether toddlers’ and parents’ act in a
more coupled manner during extended discourse. We
considered toddlers and parents to be coupled if their
looking and/or holding were synchronously directed
towards the same object. As Figure 5 indicates, there are
multiple ways dyads could be coupled. Although these
forms of coupling are not mutually exclusive (e.g., toddlers
might simultaneously be looking at what their parents are
holding and what their parents are looking at), we chose to
analyze them individually because the relevance of each
form of coupling has been suggested in the literature (see
Yu & Smith, 2013).
   For each dyad, we measured frame-by-frame whether or
not the dyads were coupled. We then examined the                         Figure 6. The degree of social coupling (both to the target
