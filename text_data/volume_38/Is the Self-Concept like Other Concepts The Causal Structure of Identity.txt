Procedure
Concept Map Task Each participant drew a computerized
map of the causal links between 16 features of their identity
(Table 1). Twelve of the sixteen features were chosen from
categories of personal identity identified as important in the
prior literature (memories, personality, morality, and
preferences/desires; e.g., Strohminger & Nichols, 2014).
The remaining four features were intended to be low
importance. Two were found, in previous research, to be
less important for identity (instances of semantic memories,
