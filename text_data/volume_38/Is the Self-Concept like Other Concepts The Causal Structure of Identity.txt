Abstract
We investigate the age-old questions of what makes us who
we are and what features of identity, if changed, would make
us a different person. Previous approaches to identity have
suggested that there is a type of feature that is most defining
of identity (e.g., autobiographical memories or moral
qualities). We propose a new approach to identity that
suggests that, like concepts in general, more causally central
features are perceived as more defining of the self-concept. In
three experiments, using both measured and manipulated
causal centrality, we find that changes to features of identity
that are perceived as more causally central are more
disruptive to both the identity of the self and others.

Introduction
Recent research has found that personal identity influences a
wide-range of in-lab and real-world decisions (e.g., Akerlof
& Kranton, 2010; Bryan et al., 2011). While this research
has explored the relationship between identity and decision
making, it largely ignores what underlies these decisions,
the representation of the self. How is the self-concept
structured and what is most defining of the self-concept?
Understanding these questions is particularly important
because beliefs about continuity of identity—whether or not
we will be the same person in the future—have been linked
to how we value future outcomes. People who believe that
their identity will change tend to discount future rewards
more steeply and show less willingness to give up
immediate rewards to save money than those who believe it
will remain stable (Bartels & Urminsky, 2011, 2015). This
paper explores how people represent the self and what
features of identity people believe they need to retain to
remain the same person.
Previous explorations of self-continuity have provided
various answers to the question of what is most defining to
identity. Philosophers have long suggested that continuity of
memories allows for continuity in identity (Locke
1694/1979). In particular, autobiographical memories
provide a unique narrative for each individual. Nichols and
Bruno (2010) found that disruption to memories disrupted
identity judgments not only for one’s self but also in
judgments of other people. Other explorations of lay
intuitions about personal identity have suggested that the
things that make us distinctive are those that make us who
we are. This includes autobiographical memories, since they
are unique for each individual. Other features that also make

us distinct and may be essential to our self-concept are
personality traits and preferences (Gelman et al., 2007).
More recent research has suggested that lay theories of
identity put moral qualities at the center of the self-concept.
Strohminger and Nichols (2014) examined this essential
moral self hypothesis by comparing how changes to moral
features and various other types of features (e.g., memories,
personality, preferences) impacted identity continuity
judgments. They found that changes to the moral features of
identity were most disruptive to identity judgments.
To bridge these approaches to identity and provide a new
framework for encompassing these discrepant findings, we
appeal to the idea, from concept and categories literature,
that more causally central features are more defining of a
concept (Ahn, et al., 2000; Rehder & Hastie 2001; Sloman,
Love, & Ahn, 1998). We propose that representations of the
self-concept are like representations of concepts in general
and hypothesize that 1) the self-concept incorporates causal
relationships between the features of identity and, 2) more
causally central features are perceived as more defining of
identity. For example, the importance of memories, traits, or
preferences for the self-concept depends on how these
features are causally related to each other and to other
features of identity. Although ideas about causal centrality
have been highly influential in the study of concepts, this is
the first time that this approach has been incorporated into a
theory of personal identity.

Causal Centrality and Continuity of Identity
In the following experiments, we measured beliefs about
how defining features of identity are to the self-concept and
beliefs about the causal centrality of these features. Beliefs
about the how defining features are to identity were
measured by asking participants how much a change to a
feature would disrupt their identity (i.e., the extent to which
a change in a feature would lead them to feel that they were
a different person). Changes to features that are more
defining to the self-concept should lead to greater perceived
disruption to identity. To measure causal centrality, we
elicited beliefs about how various features of identity are
causally linked either by having participants draw these
causal links in a concept map (Experiment 1) or by having
them verbally report these links (Experiment 2). Based on
participants’ reports, we calculated causal centrality of
features two ways described below.
Number of Causal Connections Features may be defining
to a concept to the extent that they participate in cause-

1727

effect relationships with other features of the concept
(Rehder & Hastie, 2001). This measure calculates causal
centrality as the number of direct causal relationships a
feature participates in as either a cause or an effect.
Causal Depth We also calculate causal centrality according
to Sloman et al.’s (1998) dependency model1. This model
suggests that the causal centrality is determined by causal
depth. That is, causes are more central than their effects; the
deeper a feature is in the causal chain the more central it is.
This model takes into account both the feature’s direct and
indirect effects, and the strength of these causal links.
Data Analysis In Experiments 1 and 2, for both measures of
causal centrality described above, we calculated the
Spearman correlation between causal centrality and
disruption to identity two ways: averaged across participants
and individually for each participant. If more causally
central features are more defining to identity, causal
centrality and disruption to identity will be positively
correlated such that changes to more causally central
features would be more disruptive to identity continuity.

Experiment 1
The first experiment examined whether people perceive
causally central features of identity as more defining of their
own identity. Participants performed two tasks: 1) the
concept map task, which measured the causal centrality of
16 features of personal identity and, 2) the identity
questionnaire, which measured how defining each feature
was to the participant’s personal identity.

Method
Design Participants were randomly assigned to one of two
between-participants conditions. The conditions served to
counterbalance the order the two tasks were performed in.
Participants Participants were 92 University of Chicago
students. Twelve participants were excluded due to
computer program failures, either to record data or to
display randomized features, yielding 80 cases.
Procedure
Concept Map Task Each participant drew a computerized
map of the causal links between 16 features of their identity
(Table 1). Twelve of the sixteen features were chosen from
categories of personal identity identified as important in the
prior literature (memories, personality, morality, and
preferences/desires; e.g., Strohminger & Nichols, 2014).
The remaining four features were intended to be low
importance. Two were found, in previous research, to be
less important for identity (instances of semantic memories,

Strohminger & Nichols, 2014) and two (fillers) were found
to be unimportant for identity in a pretest.
Participants used ConceptBuilder software to report
beliefs about causal relations (Kim & Park, 2009), first in an
unrelated practice task and then to draw the causal map of
personal identity using the 16 features. The features were
initially presented on the screen in random order.
Participants could move the features and draw unidirectional
or bidirectional arrows between them to represent causeeffect relationships, as they saw fit (see Figure 1). For each
link specified, participants also rated the strength of the
causal relationship (1 = weak, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong).
Identity Questionnaire Participants rated each feature on
how much a change in the feature would disrupt their
identity on a scale of 0 (exactly the same person) to 100
(completely different person).

According to this iterative model, Ci, the centrality of feature i,
is determined (at each time step) by summing across the centrality
of the concept’s other features (at time, t), cj,t, multiplied by how
dependent each feature, j, is on feature i, dij:

The implementation of the model is a repeated matrix
multiplication that comes to a stable ranking within a small number
of iterations (Kim & Park, 2009; Sloman et al., 1998).

Results & Discussion
On average, participants drew 20.0 causal links between the
features. This did not significantly differ across conditions
(Mmapfirst = 21.2, Msurveyfirst = 18.7, t(78) = 1.3, p > .05.

Number of Causal Connections Consistent with our
hypothesis, we found a significant overall Spearman
correlation between the average causal connections and
rated disruption to identity, r = .79, p < .001. This positive
relationship between causal connections and disruption to
identity was observed for 80% of participants. The mean
individual-level correlation (within-participant across all
features) between feature centrality and importance2 was
significantly positive (M = .33), t(79) = 7.4, p < .001.

Causal Depth We also found evidence that this measure of
causal centrality was associated with identity judgments.
The Spearman rank correlation between causal depth and
disruption to identity ratings was significant, r = .65, p = .01
(see Figure 3). The mean individual-level correlation
between feature centrality and disruption to identity was
significantly positive (M = .23), t(79) = 5.3, p < .001. This
positive relationship between causal depth and disruption to
identity was observed for 78% of participants.

how we perceive others (Pronin, 2008), people use
analogies to the self in forming judgments of even
dissimilar others (Orhun & Urminsky, 2013). Experiment 2
tested whether our findings generalize to judgments of other
people’s identities.
Design Participants were assigned to one of three conditions
(self, close-other, generic-other).
Participants Two-hundred-fifty participants were recruited
via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Eleven participants were
excluded before analysis, either because of a scripting error
(5), failed attention check (4), or giving all the same
answers (2), yielding 239 cases.
Procedure Participants in the self condition completed a
causal centrality task and the identity questionnaire from
Experiment 1 for features of their own identity. Participants
in the close-other condition did the same tasks for a nonromantic close other they specified, while participants in the
generic-other condition completed the tasks for a generic
other person.
To measure centrality, participants completed a “listing
causal relationships” task, using the 16 features of identity
from Experiment 1. After a practice task with feedback,
participants completed 16 individually randomized trials. In
each trial, participants saw a different target feature and
indicated which of the other 15 features, if any, were caused
by the target feature (see Figure 4). Then, for all the features
selected as direct effects of the target feature, participants
rated the strength of the relationship.3

Experiment 1 found that changes in more causally central

continuity of one’s own identity. Although our perceptions

Results & Discussion
On average, participants reported 75.7 causal links between
the 16 features of identity. The number of links chosen did
not differ by condition (Mself = 71.1, Mclose-other = 78.1,
Mgeneric-other = 77.9, F(2, 238) = .69, p > .05), suggesting
participants perceived similar causal complexity in others’
personal identity as in their own.

In a separate pre-test, we confirmed that this task yielded similar
causal centrality scores to Experiment 1’s concept map task.

Number of Causal Connections Changes in features with
more causal connections were rated as more disruptive to
identity in all conditions (self: r = .60, p = .02; close-other:
r = .62, p = .01; generic-other: r = .44, p = .09). The
differences between conditions in disruptiveness of the more
causally connected features were not significant (self vs.
close-other, p = .84, self vs. generic-other, p = .17, closeother vs. generic-other, p = .12). Likewise, the average
individual-level correlations were significantly positive and
the majority of participants had a positive correlation
between features’ causal connections and rated
disruptiveness of change in all conditions (see Table 2).
Causal Depth Changes in more causally central features
were rated as more disruptive to identity in the self and
close-other conditions (self: r = .49, p = .05; close-other: r =
.65, p = .01) but not in the generic-other condition (r = .42,
p = .11). The correlations in the close-other and genericother conditions were significantly different (p = .04).4
In all conditions, the average individual-level correlations
were significantly positive and the majority of participants
had a positive individual-level correlation between features’
causal centrality and rated disruptiveness of change (see
Table 2).

Experiment 3
There were two main aims of Experiment 3. The first aim
was to manipulate the causal centrality of features in a set
vignettes to test whether making a feature more causally
central impacts how defining that feature is for identity. In
order to do this, we constructed vignettes that described the
causal relationships between four salient features of a
person. For example, one vignette described four of Jack’s
features as relating to each other in a common cause
structure—Jack’s memories of being a lonely child caused
his shyness, his preference for solitary activities, and his
awkward demeanor (Figure 5, Version A). In order to
manipulate whether a feature was causally central or
peripheral, we created two versions of each vignette. In
another version of the above vignette the position of two
target features (shyness and memories) were flipped so that
Jack’s shyness caused his memories, preferences, and
demeanor (Figure 5, Version B). So, the exact same features
were counterbalanced to be causally central (cause feature)

The difference between the self and close-other conditions, and
the difference between the self and generic-other conditions were
not significant (p = .14, p = .58, respectively).

and causally peripheral (effect feature), to control for any
idiosyncratic influences of specific features.
The focal task was to select which of two individuals, one
missing the effect feature (e.g., shyness in Version A) and
one missing a cause feature (e.g., memories in Version B),
was more likely to be the character in the story. As
according to both approaches to causal centrality, the cause
features is more causally central than the effect feature (it is
both involved in more causal connections and deeper in the
causal chain), retaining the cause feature should be more
important for continuity of identity. So, we predicted that
participants would choose the individual who is missing the
effect feature (and retains the cause feature) as being more
likely to be the character in the vignette.
The second aim of Experiment 3 was to understand more
precisely how causal beliefs influence identity judgments.
To do this, we created common effect (one effect with three
causes) versions of all the vignettes which allows us to
distinguish between the two approaches to causal centrality.
For example, the common effect version of Jack’s vignette
presented his childhood memories as an effect of the other
three features, including shyness (Figure 5, Version C). As
with the common cause vignettes, we created two versions
of the common effect vignettes to counterbalance the
position of two target features in the causal structure. The
other common effect version of Jack’s vignette presented
his shyness as an effect of the other three features, including
his memories (Figure 5, Version D).
Unlike the common cause vignettes, the two accounts of
causal centrality make different predictions about which
individual should be selected in the common effect
vignettes. The causal depth approach predicts that the
individual missing the effect is more likely to be judged as
the character in the story. This is because features deeper in
the causal chain (the cause features) are more important to
categorization, and in this case, to identity continuity. In
contrast, the number of causal connections approach
predicts that participants will tend to pick the person
missing the cause feature. This is because the effect feature
is linked to all three cause features while each cause is only
linked to one other feature, the effect feature. So, based on
the number of causal connections measure, childhood
memories would be more causally central than shyness in
Versions C, whereas shyness would be more causally
central than childhood memories in Versions D.

Method

Results & Discussion

Design Participants were randomly assigned to read one of
two sets (Set 1 vs. Set 2) of six vignettes which
counterbalanced which vignettes described a common effect
vs common cause structure.
Participants Sixty participants were recruited via Amazon
Mechanical Turk. Four participants were removed before
analysis, either for answering the comprehension check
question wrong or for failing an attention check.
Materials We constructed six vignettes that described the
causal relationships between four features of a person’s
identity. There were four versions of each vignette that
contained the same four features. Two described a common
cause structure and two described a common effect
structure.
The vignettes were split into two sets (Sets 1 and 2). Each
set contained both common cause versions for three
vignettes and both common effect versions for the other
three vignettes (e.g., for the Jack vignette Set 1 contained
Versions A and B, Set 2 contained Versions C and D, see
Figure 5). Participants were randomly assigned to read one
of the two versions of each vignette in the set (which
counterbalanced the position of features in the causal
structure, e.g., Version A or B in the common cause
version). So, participants read only one version of each of
the six vignettes.
Procedure Each participant read the six vignettes in the set
that they were assigned to. Diagrams like those in Figure 5
accompanied the vignettes and could be used to answer the
questions. The order of presentation of the vignettes was
randomized within-participants.
To measure which feature was seen as more defining to
identity, after reading each vignette, we asked participants
which of the two people was most likely to be the character
in the vignette. One person was missing a cause feature; the
other was missing an effect feature. Participants read that
these people retained the other three features of the
character in the vignette. Participants then reported how
plausible they felt the vignette was on a scale of 0 (not at all
plausible) to 100 (extremely plausible).

The dependent measure was the average of the individuallevel percentage of trials in which the participant selected
the person missing the effect feature. For the common cause
trials, we predicted that participants would pick the person
missing the causally peripheral effect feature as the same
person rather than the person missing the causally central
cause feature. This is what we found. Participants were
significantly more likely to select the person missing the
effect feature (M = 72%, t(55) = 5.3, p < .01), replicating the
prior findings with a causal manipulation.
For the common effect trials, however, the two
approaches to causal centrality yield different predictions.
The number of causal connections approach suggests a
missing effect should disrupt identity more than a missing
cause. So, based on this definition of causal centrality, the
results should be the reverse of the common cause trials,
with participants picking the person missing the effect less
than the person missing the cause. In contrast, the causal
depth approach implies that a missing cause should disrupt
identity more than a missing effect would. This approach
predicts that participants will pick the person missing the
effect more than the person missing the cause, just as they
did for common cause trials.
Our results are more consistent with the number of causal
connections approach. In the common effect condition,
participants were less likely to select the person missing the
effect feature—the feature that had more connections but
was less deep—than the person missing the cause feature (M
= 41%), t(55) = 2.6, p = .01. The average percentage of
missing effect selections was significantly different between
the common cause and common effect conditions, (Ms =
72% vs. 41%), t(55) = 5.2, p < .01.
Because different causal structures may also differ in how
natural they appear to be (Ahn, 1999), we also examined the
plausibility of the two different types of causal structures.
The common cause and common effect vignettes were rated
as equally plausible (Mcommoncause = 73.9, Mcommoneffect = 72.5,
t(55) < 1, p > .05). So, the observed difference in selections
between the two conditions cannot be explained by a
difference in the believability of the two causal structures.
These results experimentally corroborate our correlational
findings. Change in more causally central features, as
defined by the number of causal connections, is more
disruptive to perceived continuity of identity.
Lastly, we looked at the effects of vignette plausibility.
Concepts, in general, are influenced by our prior knowledge
(Murphy & Medin, 1985). This suggests that prior intuitions
about what causal relationships are likely to occur among
features of identity may moderate identity judgments. The
higher the perceived plausibility, the more likely that
participants believed that the feature described as having
fewer connections was actually causally peripheral and the
more likely that they selected the person missing the
causally peripheral feature.
We found the predicted moderation by plausibility. We
found a correlation between the plausibility of the story and

Figure 5: Structure of vignettes used in Experiment 3. There
were four versions of each vignette: two versions for each causal
structure. Versions A/B and C/D counterbalanced the placement of
the target features as cause or effect.

the proportion of selections of the person missing the
causally peripheral feature with fewer connections (r = .64,
p < .001). The average proportion of selections of the person
missing the causally peripheral feature was significantly
higher among the twelve most plausible vignettes (M =
74.2%) than the twelve least plausible vignettes (M =
55.7%), t(22) = 2.5, p = .02.

General Discussion
We found that, as with concepts in general, causal beliefs
play a critical role in the representation of the self-concept.
People perceived more causally central features as being
more necessary for continuity of identity, for both the self
(Experiment 1) and others (Experiment 2). Manipulating the
causal centrality of a feature changed perceptions of how
defining that feature was to identity (Experiment 3).
While both the number of causal connections and causal
depth related to how defining a feature was to identity, the
results of Experiment 3 suggest that the number of causal
connections better describes how causal beliefs influence
identity judgments. This suggests that features that either
cause many other features or are caused by the combination
of many other features (or both) will be most defining of
identity. As causes generally occur before their effects, this
means that the features that develop early in our lives (e.g.,
childhood memories) will not necessarily remain the most
defining to identity, contrary to what a causal depth
approach would suggest. Rather how defining an earlydeveloping feature is to identity will depend on how many
other features it causes. Late-developing features will be
important if they are caused by the combination of other
features and, in turn, cause new features.
Our approach to identity may also have implications for
understanding affective responses. In fact, it has been
suggested that differences in representations of the selfconcept can explain differences in affective responses to
stress and failure. People with whose self-aspects are highly
overlapping or highly associated tend to have more trouble
coping with negative experiences because failure in one
aspect is likely to spillover into other aspects of the self
(Linville, 1987; McConnell, 2011). Our results suggest that
understanding the causal relationships between these aspects
may be useful to predicting what types of negative
experiences will be most impactful on mood and affect.
Prior research has focused on comparing the individual
importance of different types of features. These approaches
seem to have missed a critical aspect of representations of
identity, beliefs about the causal relationships between
features. These relationships influence the extent to which a
feature defines identity. These findings are consistent with
the general drive to explain the world, including ourselves,
using causal relations (Gopnik, 1998; Keil, 2006).
