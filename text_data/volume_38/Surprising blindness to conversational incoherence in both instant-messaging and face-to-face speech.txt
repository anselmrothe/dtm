sent during the conversation (one from each participant) were
replaced by fake messages (always at least 270 seconds after
the beginning of the conversation and within 120 seconds of
the end). All inserted messages all had the same phrasing:

There were two between-subjects conditions (with 10 pairs
each). In the Gender-swap condition the famous person
named was chosen from among Hillary, Einstein, Marilyn,
and MLK, all of whom were depicted in the photograph (Fig-
ure 2), but the phrase “women like me” or “men like me”
was chosen to conflict with the apparent sender’s real gen-
der. For example, a line that supposedly came from a female
participant might read “of these six Einsteins kind of an icon
for men like me”. In the Character-swap condition the re-
