the right-hand side of the screen. The choice items were
counterbalanced across the triads so that in half the triads
the action choice appeared on the left hand side while in
the remaining half the action choice appeared on the right.
After they had made their choice the triad disappeared and
the fixation cue appeared again for the next triad.
Participants completed all 16 trials and were debriefed.
