Data coding
In total, our 36 speakers produced 1296 object descriptions.
There were 25 missing cases due to technical issues with the
audio recordings. The remaining 1271 descriptions were all
coded for the occurrence of referential overspecification. A
description was either overspecified (score = 1) or not (score
= 0). Overspecified descriptions always contained color and
size: one attribute which was necessary for identification of
the target referent, and one redundant attribute. Descriptions      Figure 2: Proportion of color-only, size-only, and color-and-
