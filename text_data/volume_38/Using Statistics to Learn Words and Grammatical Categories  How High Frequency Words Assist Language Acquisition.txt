To test segmentation, we created a two-alternative forced-
choice task to examine participants’ preferences for words
versus non-words (see Saffran et al., 1996 for a similar use
of words and non-words). Non-words were bisyllabic items
that comprised the last syllable of one target word and the
first syllable of another. Non-words did not occur during the          Inconsistent:

prevented from occurring: for Marker0, they were formed
from the omitted word transitions, and for Marker1 and
Marker2, non-words did not occur because a marker word
intervened. Selecting a word over a non-word on this task
would indicate that participants had successfully identified
target words in the speech stream.
