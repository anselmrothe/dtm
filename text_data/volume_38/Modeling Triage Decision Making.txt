Annotated Enron Email Data Set and compared the model’s
judgments to those of participants from a new experiment
described below. This dataset consists of emails that have
been hand-labeled with topics by a trained annotator, with
one topic label per email (Berry & Browne, 2007). The
topics used in our experiment were: California Analysis and
Daily Business. California Analysis emails included
executive summaries and analyses about the company’s
affairs in California. The Daily Business emails are about
buying and trading shares on the stock market, setting up
meetings, and confirming meetings, as well as general
announcements from human resources.

word in each sentence was treated independently, without
regard to the words that preceded it. It is doubtful that the
evidence provided by each word would be treated
completely independently. Just as words are more or less
common given a specific topic, words are expected to show
a similar relationship to each other. Words are likely related
to each other such that processing one would provide
evidence about the likelihood of another. This type of
redundancy would cause diminishing returns from the
continued skimming of a document. This could be
accounted with the PMI calculation that included not only
the relationship between a given word and the topic, but
also the words with each other. We plan to explore this
possibility in future work.
