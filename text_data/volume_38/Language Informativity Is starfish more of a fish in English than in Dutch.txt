Method
Participants Sixty one English speakers (46 females and 15
males, mean age: 22 years and 4.5 months), 60 Dutch
speakers (48 females and 12 males, mean age: 18 years and
5 months), and 67 Indonesian speakers (41 females and 25
males, mean age: 24 years and 8 months) participated in the
second study. One participant was excluded since she was
originally from Malaysia and spoke Malay as her mother
tongue. None of them participated in Study 1, nor were they
aware of the purpose of this study. The Dutch speakers were
students who got credits in exchange for participation, the
Indonesian participants were students who live and study in
Indonesia, and the English speakers were recruited online
using Mechanical Turk.
Materials A list of 46 questions was presented to the
participants in a website survey. Six items were most
informative in English (e.g., ladybird, eggplant, jellyfish),
six items were most informative in Dutch (e.g., kikkervisje,
inktvis, stinkdier [tadpole, squid, skunk]), and another six
items were most informative in Bahasa (e.g., ikan hiu,
burung hantu, burung kakaktua [shark, owl, cockatoo]). The
remaining items were fillers, consisting of eight items that
were informative in all three languages (English, Dutch, and
Bahasa), and 20 items that were not informative in any of
the three languages.
Procedure All questions were of the following format:
“How typical is x for the category of X?”. All informative
items (x) were paired with the category name (X) that was
included in the objects’ name. For example: “How typical is          Figure 2: Averaged raw (upper panel) and z-transformed
