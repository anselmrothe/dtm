Results
   We conducted a 3 (Group) × 8 (Block) × 8 (Number of
Doors) ANOVA on the dependent measures of correct
responses, confidence (calculated for the second response in
a trial), and the total number of “switch” trials per
participant and block. As in Experiment 1, we report only
those results that achieved both significance and meaningful
effect size. Group significantly affected number of switches,

average, the Descending group had the highest number of

Ascending group (M = 24.23, SD = 7), with the random

Participants change their actions based on changing

actions are undertaken not wholly in keeping with degree of
assent to the correctness of the action. Finally, there are
large-scale dynamics with patterns of consistency that
provide theoretical and methodological insights into
investigating changes in belief.
