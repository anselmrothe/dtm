   Next, we adopted the same criterion as previous studies and
identified children as ‘mappers’ if their slopes were ≥ 0.3 (Le
Corre & Carey, 2007; Gunderson et al., 2015; Davidson et al,
2012; Odic et al., 2015). In a cross-sectional study, Le Corre
and Carey (2007) found a 6-month difference in age between
CP-mappers and CP-non-mappers, and Gunderson and
colleagues (2015) found a 3-month difference in age. To
investigate the developmental trajectory of mappers and non-
mappers, we identified CP-knowers as mappers if their slopes
were ≥ 0.3 at Session 1, and non-mappers if their slopes were
less than 0.3. We asked (1) how likely CP-non-mappers were
to become mappers at the end of the study, and (2) whether
CP-mappers continued to be mappers throughout the course
of the study.
   We first asked how likely children who were non-mappers
at Session 1 were to become mappers by Session 6. Among
the 7 non-mappers, only 1 child became a mapper, 4
remained non-mappers, and 2 children did not complete
Session 6. While this finding may suggest that most CP non-
mappers remained non-mappers throughout the six-month
period, an inspection of the individual development of slopes
shows that children’s slopes fluctuated over time (Figure 4).
We found that the 7 non-mappers remained non-mappers for
the remaining five sessions approximately 60% of the time (3             Figure 4: Scatterplots of mean slopes for each session for
