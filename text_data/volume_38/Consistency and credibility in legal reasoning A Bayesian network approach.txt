between current and previous studies. In previous studies
participants read descriptions of hypothetical cases in which
prior conviction evidence outweighed other evidence in the
case. In this study prior conviction information was
balanced with other issues in the case, which could account
for the lack of difference between conditions. These results
suggest that people do more than constructing a plausible
story from the evidence; also factoring in the consistency
and credibility of witnesses. The key effect of consistency
on people’s judgments of credibility and guilt was replicated
in a laboratory study too.
