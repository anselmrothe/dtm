Assume that the conditional distribution of the observation
given the hidden states is multinomial distributed. Let the
parameters of this distribution be a linear combination of the
observations with a weight vector ui ∈ RNo that depends on
the respective hidden state such that

If the weight vectors have been determined, through learn-

P(ot+1 , {st+1 }) is accomplished by inserting the new obser-
