   In the current research, we investigate the relationship be-
tween language style and discussion participation through the
lens of CAT. More specifically, we examine the hypothe-

toward syntactic convergence by analyzing the syntax and
structure of their sentences throughout a document (in our
study, post or comment). To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first project which studies CAT by focusing on syn-
tax and structure of language, not just word usage. In other
words, we focus on how people put words together instead of                         v1      v2     v3     v4        v5     v6
