 scores for the two conditions. We further compute a differ-
 ence score by subtracting across-speaker scores from within-
 speaker scores. The absolute scores take into account the ease
 of discriminating each contrast while the difference scores
 show how much each contrast is affected by speaker variabil-
 ity. To obtain distributional information, we randomly sub-
 sample speakers for each contrast 1000 times.
                             Results
 The mean discriminability scores, both within- and across-
 speaker, for every available contrast in the corpus (a total of
 358) are shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the difference
 scores for the subset of contrasts that we selected on the ba-
 sis of infant research on this topic (results using both male
 and female speakers). Table 2 contains the discriminability
 scores that form the basis for the depicted difference scores.
 Together, the two figures and the table illustrate the follow-
 ing:
1. There is always an advantage (a higher score,) for within-
    compared to between- speaker discriminability. The mean
    difference score for all contrasts is .115 (95% CI: [.087,
    .142]; score range: .003-.278).                                    Figure 1: Mean discriminability scores for all possible con-
