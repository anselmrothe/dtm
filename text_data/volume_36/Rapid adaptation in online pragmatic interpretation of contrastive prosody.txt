   converge on consistent prosodic interpretations. We investi-        extend this logic to explain how listeners navigate syntactic

   prosody based on recent exposure and, if so, whether such           variability to achieve robust and timely sentence processing

   ing. We used the visual-world paradigm to investigate effects          In the current study we evaluate the hypothesis that the
   of prosodic cue reliability on the real-time interpretation of
   the construction “It looks like an X” pronounced either with        human language comprehension system likewise deals with
   (a) a H* pitch accent on the final noun, or (b) a contrastive       prosodic variability through sensitivity to statistics in the in-
   L+H* pitch accent on looks and a rising boundary tone, a con-       put. Specifically, we ask if listeners adapt their real-time
   tour that can support a complex contrastive inference (e.g., It
   LOOKS like a zebra...(but it is not)). Eye-movements suggest        prosodic interpretations to the reliability of prosodic cue val-
   that listeners process the L+H* on looks as an early cue to         ues assessed in recent exposure. To this end, we investigate
   a contrastive interpretation. This effect, however, diminished      English speaker’s interpretation of an intonation contour that
   when listeners had been exposed to the same speaker using
   the L+H* accent infelicitously (e.g., Show me the blue square.      is known to evoke a contrastive interpretation: the contrastive

One long-standing issue in prosody research is how listeners           as hearing L+H* on a color adjective (e.g., “Pick up a blue

to map prosodic feature values onto more abstract prosodic             independently. In other words, some speakers may express a
representation (e.g., “high” tones), they therefore must take          contrastive inference primarily through a pitch accent while
into account numerous situation-specific factors.                      others may rely more on a boundary tone. One way of navi-

sociated them with the two prosodic contours. In the High-
reliability condition, participants selected the prototypical tar-

Low-reliability condition, participants selected the prototyp-

prosody, and 44.1% of the time with Verb-focus prosody.
   We constructed a multilevel logistic regression model with
prosody condition, display type (i.e. 1-contrast vs. 2-contrast
display), reliability manipulation and their interactions as
fixed effects, and random intercepts and prosody slopes for
participants and items1 . As expected, prosody condition was
a significant predictor of participants’ picture choices (β =
−3.17, z = −16.391, p < .0001). The interaction term be-
tween the prosody and reliability manipulation was also sig-
nificant (β = 0.89, z = −3.175, p < .01). Thus participants’
interpretations of Verb-Focus prosody were more or less con-
sistent across the High-reliability and the Low-reliability con-
