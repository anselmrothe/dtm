   Participants were instructed to work on the tasks
according to the timing provided by the researcher. They
were presented with a cover story and invited to start with
the first task. The time limit for the reading of the base story
was 2 minutes. Then, the researcher instructed participants
to proceed to page 2 to rate the intentions of the character in
the target story. After another 2 minutes, participants were
instructed to proceed to page 3 in order to write down what
they remember from the first story at their own pace. After
the end of the study, the participants were debriefed and
invited to ask questions.
