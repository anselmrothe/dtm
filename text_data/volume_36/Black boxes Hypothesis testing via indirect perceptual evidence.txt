to judge that this box would give you a better chance of get-
ting the shiny pencil, you must understand what each object
would sound like when shaken inside a box, and you must
reason both about what you heard and about what you didn’t.
You must also compare the probability of obtaining the de-
sired object from each box. In Study 1, we put children in
exactly this situation to investigate whether they understand
that what they hear can be more or less informative depending
on what they didn’t perceive.
