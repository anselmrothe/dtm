Semantic Space
The semantic space contains the symbolic representation of
perceptual primitives such that they can be used in a symbolic
reasoning process. The space representation removes the re-
quirement for symbolic reasoning in the grounding process
while also providing a framework through which semantic
distances can be defined. We define the semantic space us-
ing the discrete topology, meaning that every point is distinct
from the others and has some neighborhood in the space con-
sisting only of itself. Singletons (points) in this space corre-
spond to perceptual primitives, each of which has a corre-
sponding region in a perceptual space.                               Figure 1: To illustrate the notion of homotopy inverse, here
