Rapid Learning Effects
We hypothesized two aspects to learning in the context of
this study: an early sensitivity to position-specific
regularities and a slower extraction of non-adjacent
dependencies. While the latter hinges on the learner’s built-
up experience with a series of subtly patterned triplets, the
former should emerge after only a handful of trials. As the
subject incrementally learns about the underlying process
that creates the observed sequences, it follows that their             Figure 3. Relationship between change in processing time
