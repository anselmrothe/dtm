  The other cognitive measures used in this study were the TOL
(Unterrainer et al., 2004) and part V of the Modern Language
Aptitude Test (MLAT; Carroll & Sapon, 1959). The computerized
TOL was included based on previous studies (Ettlinger et al., 2012;
Morgan-Short, Faretta-Stutenberg et al., 2012) and was used in
order to more fully capture the underlying construct of procedural
memory. However, upon analysis, the TOL did not demonstrate a
stable relationship to other measures of procedural memory and
was not included in the analyses reported below. The MLAT V
was used as a measure of declarative memory but is not included in
the analyses below because it is not related to the current research
questions.
