myosin variable names are renamed generically to ‘Input
A,’ ‘Output B,’ etc., which ensures minimal learning during
this baseline measurement task.
  Then, a baseline assessment of whether users could
demonstrate inter-level causal reasoning was collected by
asking questions about how changing design inputs might
change system behavior. This was conducted by presenting
users a system configuration clearly in the continuous or
intermittent behavioral regime to a knowledgeable user, and
then asking whether the filament velocity of the system
would increase or stay about the same when a particular
design input was changed. This question is an assessment of

   After users had completed all the design tasks, their
understanding of inter-level causalities was assessed to
address the second hypothesis: Users exposed to animated
renderings of agent-based simulation behavior will be able
to demonstrate understanding of inter-level causal
relationships. In each assessment phase, users were asked
two questions of how filament velocity of a system would
change if reconfigured. In each pairing, users were expected
to recognize the emergent behavioral regime of the system
on their own and questions were always paired such that the
system would change regimes upon alteration in one
question but not both.
