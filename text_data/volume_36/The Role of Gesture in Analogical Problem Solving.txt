Procedure
After consenting to participate, participants were told they
were first going to participate in a study about how people
remember and retell stories. They were then given one of
the two stories (‘The General’ or ‘The Fire Chief,’ order
counterbalanced across subjects) and asked to read it
carefully so that they would be able to retell it later on.
After three minutes, the story was taken away and a
confederate, posing as another participant, was brought in.
The participant was asked to retell the story they read to the
confederate. No mention of gesture was made. When they
were done, the confederate left the room and the participant
was handed the second story. After three minutes, the
confederate was brought in again and the participant retold                Figure 1: Examples of redistribution gestures produced by

explanation for the correlation we observed is that gestures
may be more likely to be produced when imagery is
particularly vivid (Hostetter & Alibali, 2008). If this is the
case, then the strength of the imagery underlying that
gesture— rather than gesture per se— might be what
hinders transfer in the story phase. And since the imagery
underlying generic redistribution gestures produced in the
similarities phase is likely more schematic, the fact that it is
strong may no longer hinder transfer. Another alternative
explanation is that, given recent findings that gesture is
more likely to be produced by individuals with poor spatial
reasoning ability (Chu et al., 2013), one could predict that
