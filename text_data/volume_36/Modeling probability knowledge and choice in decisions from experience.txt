A New Approach
In developing our modeling approach, we highlight two limi-
tations of the current choice modeling enterprise, exemplified
by the TPT. First, many current models are highly specific
and only successful in the task for which they were origi-
nally designed. Second, existing data and procedures make it
difficult to discriminate between models – models that make
a variety of assumptions can perform nearly equally well.
This is due to the limited variability in the problem sets
