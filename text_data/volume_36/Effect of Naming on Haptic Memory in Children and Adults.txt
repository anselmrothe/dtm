olfactory memory, participants should benefit from
providing consistent names during encoding and retrieval.
Preschoolers and elementary-school children participated, as
well as adults. For control purposes, a condition was added
in which naming occurred only during retrieval, not
encoding. Furthermore, we manipulated the familiarity of
shapes, as a way of exploring the development of haptic
memory. Unfamiliar shapes are likely to mimic odors that
are very difficult to name.
