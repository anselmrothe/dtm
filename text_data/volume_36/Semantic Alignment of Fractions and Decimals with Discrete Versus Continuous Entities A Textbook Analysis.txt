whereas discontinuity indicates the existence of more than

in the development of “number sense” (Dehaene, 1997).
According to Dahaene and his colleagues, an approximate
sense of magnitude for mass entities is evolutionarily more
primitive than exact calculations with discrete objects

is the first opportunity for children to explicitly align
entities with numbers. The counting process involves one-
to-one mapping of consecutive integers to distinct objects
(e.g., stickers, chairs), such that a child increments the
integer magnitude simultaneously with the act of moving
through the set of objects, with the last number denoting the
set cardinality (e.g., 3 stickers, 4 chairs). The use of integers
in counting discrete objects precedes their use in exact              Figure 1. Alignment of discrete and continuous entities with
