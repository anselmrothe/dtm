                           Introduction
In spatial cognition research human navigation and spatial
orientation are two of the core topics. According to Montel-
lo (2005) navigation can be divided into two components :
locomotion and wayfinding. Locomotion is the pure active
or passive (i.e., to which amount a person can control the
speed and direction) movement through an environment.
Wayfinding is the related but planned movement to a certain
destination (cognitive component).
   Without the help of any means (e.g., maps and/or naviga-
tion systems) it is unlikely to reach distant goals if no men-          Figure 1. A prototypical cross intersection with four poss i-

blocks serves as possible landmark surfaces. At an intersec-      located in the second row and third column in the maze

landmark facades resulting in eight surfaces which can be
controlled individually. These two-dimensional surfaces
have a standard size of 3.5 x 3.5 metres.
   Moreover, the paths between the blocks have a default
width of four metres and serve as routes in every possible
manner. The bottom surface is textured with a brick texture.
The blocks are coloured in light grey and the sky in light
blue (see also figure 5). If the experiment is meant to be an
indoor experiment, a grey ceiling is inserted.
The SQUARELAND 2.0 markup language

   Moreover, at each intersection of the route, a maximum of
eight (potential) landmarks can be implemented via the
above mentioned block facades. Therefore, a landmark can
only consist of either a RGB colour value or a picture file
(e.g., jpeg) which is projected on the block facade.
Movement settings. In SQUARELAND 2.0 it is possible to
choose from two different movement modes: active and
passive. The active movement mode enables the participants
to move self-directed on a given route. This movement,
however, follows predefined invisible tracks which prevent
participants from walking too close to a block or from
bumping into it. As user interface the arrow keys of the           Figure 5. A typical intersection with four different potential
