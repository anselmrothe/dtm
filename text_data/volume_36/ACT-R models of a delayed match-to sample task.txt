Equivalence testing was then performed, whereby
maximum likely differences (MLD) were calculated
reflecting the maximum difference between the model data
(at a given parameter set) and the human data. The values
were calculated according to Equation 1, where Rl to Ru are
the 95% inferential confidence intervals for the real-world
(i.e., empirical) data, and Ml to Mu are the model 95%
confidence intervals.
            MLD = max(Mu – Rl, Ru – Ml)                  (1)
   When the MLD is less than a threshold value, which is the
maximum difference deemed unimportant on substantive
grounds (Tyron, 2001), then the 95% CI test for statistical
equivalence is also satisfied. The minimum threshold value
