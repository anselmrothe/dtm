Abstract
Children as young as age 3 understand that different people
have different areas of expertise (i.e., the division of cognitive
labor) and they choose information sources accordingly (e.g.,
Lutz & Keil, 2002). However, it is unclear whether this
understanding depends primarily on social cognitive skills,
such as an appreciation of others’ mental states, or non-social
cognitive skills, such as the ability to categorize different
types of entities. To address this question, children ages 3 to 5
(n=63) completed tasks measuring social and non-social
cognitive skills, and made inferences about what two
unfamiliar experts would know. The results demonstrate that
developmental differences in children’s understanding of
expertise are mediated through concomitant differences in
categorization ability, but not theory of mind.
Keywords: Theory of mind; categorization; expertise;
conceptual development; social cognition.

Introduction
It is impossible for one person to know everything. Instead,
individuals have non-overlapping knowledge bases such
that each person acquires some information firsthand but
must rely on other people to access additional information.
Because young children are very limited in their direct
access to information and they must rely primarily on others
for answers, it is unsurprising that the ability to evaluate
potential information sources emerges early in life (see
Harris, 2012). One way that children can evaluate
informants is by considering their areas of expertise. By age
3, children demonstrate a basic understanding of expertise
and its relevance for choosing informants. They prefer to
consult a car mechanic over a doctor to learn about fixing a
bicycle (Lutz & Keil, 2002; Shenouda & Danovitch, 2013)
and they trust a dog expert to teach them about dogs, but not
about artifacts (Koenig & Jaswal, 2011). By age 5, children
can identify which of three familiar experts is best suited to
answering a question (Aguiar, Stoess, & Taylor, 2012).
Children this age not only infer that an expert is likely to
know about phenomena closely related to his or her area of
expertise, but they also extend the expert’s knowledge to
more distantly related phenomena that involve the same
underlying causal principles. For example, children indicate
that a bicycle expert would also know about how other
vehicles, such as trains and cars, work and would even have
a superior understanding of other mechanical devices, such

as yo-yos and ladders, relative to an individual with
expertise in a biological domain. These findings suggest that
by age 5 children already have an understanding of how
knowledge clusters in other minds, without having
necessarily received explicit instruction about the domains
of expertise involved.
Although children make quite sophisticated judgments
about expertise by age 5, this ability emerges gradually over
the preschool years. Lutz and Keil (2002) found that 3-yearolds restricted expert knowledge to phenomena involving
topics closely related to an expert’s area of interest (what
Lutz & Keil call the “near” category, e.g., judging that an
eagle expert knows how ducks swim). By age 4, children
extended expert knowledge to questions about more
distantly related phenomena (the “middle” category, e.g.,
how dogs breathe) and, by age 5, they did so for questions
about even more distantly related phenomena with the same
underlying causal principles (e.g., why apples are sweet).
How do children make these inferences without prior
instruction or familiarity with scientific domains?
According to Lutz and Keil, children do not base their
judgments on mere semantic associations or associations
between the topics in question. Instead, children’s choices
reflect their application of cognitive schemas that tap into
the common principles underlying phenomena in domains
such as biology and physics. Children refine these schemas
and apply them more flexibly as they mature, resulting in
increasingly sophisticated judgments about expertise
throughout middle childhood (Danovitch & Keil, 2004; Keil
et al., 2008).
Children’s reasoning about expertise becomes more
sophisticated and nuanced between ages 3 and 5, yet the
sources of developmental differences in their reasoning
remain unexplored. What skills contribute to children’s
ability to draw inferences about the way knowledge clusters
in expert minds? The current study explores several
potential contributors to developmental and individual
differences in inferring expert knowledge, with a special
emphasis on children’s social cognitive understanding and
their categorization skill.
Children are motivated from infancy to seek out other
people and to understand other minds (see Flavell & Miller,
1998), and it seems likely that judging expertise requires at
least a basic appreciation that other minds are different from

2097

one’s own, known as theory of mind (ToM). Specifically,
deciding which of two experts to consult may require
knowing that 1) different experts have different, sometimes
non-overlapping, knowledge bases, and 2) an expert is more
likely to provide accurate answers to questions related to his
or her expertise than a non-expert. ToM skills undergo
dramatic improvement between ages 3 and 5 (see Wellman,
Cross, & Watson, 2001) and there is some evidence that
children with a more advanced ToM are more adept at
evaluating informants based on past accuracy (Fusaro &
Harris, 2008, but see Pasquini et al., 2007). Thus, children’s
developing ability to infer what a particular expert knows
may be closely tied to their emerging understanding of
others’ mental states.
A different type of skill that may underlie children’s
understanding of expertise is a form of non-social
reasoning: the ability to categorize objects. Within their first
few years, children group objects into categories (e.g.,
Mandler & Bauer, 1988) and use these categories as a basis
for inductive judgments (see Gelman, 2003). For example, if
a novel animal is categorized as a dog, children assume it
shares more characteristics with other dogs than with cats.
Categorization skill may play a critical role in children’s
inferences about who is likely to provide the best answer to
a question by enabling the child to connect areas of
expertise with the phenomenon in question without
necessarily knowing much about the phenomenon
themselves. For instance, in order to determine whether an
eagle or a bicycle expert knows more about how flowers
bloom, a child might begin by categorizing both eagles and
flowers as living things and bicycles as non-living artifacts.
Thus, despite the fact that judgments about knowledge and
expertise involve people, children’s understanding of the
division of cognitive labor may be rooted in their nonsocial-cognitive skills.
The objective of the current study was to determine to
what extent categorization ability (CA) and ToM contribute
to children’s developing understanding of the division of
cognitive labor and account for developmental differences
in their understanding. The current study also addresses two
additional factors that could potentially mediate or
contribute directly to children’s understanding of expert
knowledge: executive function (EF) and language skills.
There is evidence that EF, broadly defined as the ability to
regulate one’s own behavior, is linked to children’s
understanding of false-beliefs (e.g., Carlson & Moses, 2001,
Sabbagh et al., 2006). It could also be important for
categorization if one assumes that children must
successfully inhibit responses grounded in more simple
heuristics, such as perceptual similarity, in order to
categorize objects in terms of more abstract features.
Although there are many ways of defining and measuring
EF, we selected tasks that tap into inhibitory control (e.g.,
the day/night stroop; Gerstadt, Hong, & Diamond, 1994),
and attention shifting and flexibility (e.g., the dimensional
card sort; Frye, Zelazo, & Palfai, 1995), as we predicted that
these skills would have the closest link to categorization. A

measure of children’s receptive language was also included
because verbally skillful children are likely to have higher
ToM scores (e.g., Happe, 1995) and they may consequently
be better at comprehending statements and questions about
the topic of an individual’s expertise.
Because a basic understanding of the topics in question
seems necessary for making judgments about expertise, in
addition to evidence that older children use schemas to
cluster knowledge (e.g., Keil et al., 2008), CA was
hypothesized to predict young children’s understanding of
expertise to some extent. However, hypotheses for the role
of ToM were less clear. Because reasoning about expertise
is intimately related to predicting and representing
knowledge in other people’s minds, ToM seems necessary
to infer expert knowledge. On the other hand, ToM could be
a relatively minor contributor to understanding expertise if
children can potentially make correct judgments about an
unfamiliar expert’s knowledge simply by linking the topic
of expertise (e.g., eagles, bicycles) to the topic of the
question (e.g., ducks, elevators) without necessarily
appreciating the expert’s mental states. The purpose of this
investigation was to clarify the role of CA and ToM with
respect to understanding the division of cognitive labor.
Because CA, ToM, and children’s understanding of
expertise were all expected to improve with age, and with
improving verbal and EF abilities, the analyses focus on
whether CA and ToM mediate age-related differences in
children’s understanding of the division of cognitive labor.

Method
Participants
Nineteen 3-year-olds ranging from 3.07 to 3.84 (M = 3.52, 7
males), 26 4-year-olds ranging from 4.02 to 4.98 (M = 4.55,
16 males), and 18 5-year-olds ranging from 5.09 to 5.63 (M
= 5.40, 8 males) participated at preschools in a mid-sized
Midwestern city. The majority of the children were
identified by their parents as Caucasian-American and nonHispanic.

Materials and procedure
Theory of Mind tasks. The ToM tasks consisted of four
measures of children’s understanding of other people’s
mental states, drawn from Wellman and Liu’s (2004) ToM
scale: diverse desires, diverse beliefs, knowledge access and
contents false belief. Tasks were administered and scored
exactly as described by Wellman and Liu, with 1 point
awarded for correct responses to the entire measure
(including control questions). Summing the scores from
each task yielded a total ToM score of 0 to 4 for each child.
Expert knowledge. The script for the expert knowledge
task was drawn verbatim from Lutz and Keil (2002,
Experiment 2). Questions involved 8 “near” phenomena
involving a closely related category (e.g., “who would know
more about how chickens lay eggs?”), 8 “middle”
phenomena involving a more distantly related category

(e.g., “who would know more about how elevators go up
and down?”), and 8 phenomena involving the same
underlying principles of biology or physics (e.g., “who
would know more about what makes grass green?”). (The
classification of questions into “near,” “middle,” and
“underlying principles” was drawn directly from Lutz &
Keil). The order in which the experts were introduced was
balanced across participants and the questions were
intermixed and presented in one of two orders. Correct
responses were totaled to yield scores of 0 to 8 for each
category of items.
Categorization. In the categorization task, children were
presented with images of an eagle and a bicycle (from the
expert knowledge task) on a sheet of paper. Children then
viewed a card with an image of an object and were told:
“This is a [object name]. Which one does a [object] go
with?” Images were black-and-white line drawings. The 24
objects corresponded to the subject of each question in the
expert knowledge task (e.g., chicken, elevator, grass). The
location of the target pictures on the paper were balanced
across participants and the object images were presented in
one of two random orders. Responses were scored as correct
if the choice of object corresponded to the correct response
on the expert knowledge task (e.g., pairing the chicken with
the eagle).
Language ability. Children completed the Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test, Form B (PPVT-4; Dunn & Dunn, 2007), a
measure of receptive language. Standardized scores were
used for data analysis.
Executive function. Participants completed the day/night
stroop (Gerstadt, Hong, & Diamond, 1994) with their score
being the proportion correct out of 16 trials and the
dimensional change card sort task (Frye, Zelazo, & Palfai,
1995; Zelazo, Frye, & Rapus, 1996) with their score being the
proportion correct of 8 post-switch trials. A mean EF score
was calculated based on the proportion of correct responses
generated in each task.

Order of presentation. Data was collected over 2 sessions.
Fifty-six participants completed the sessions exactly 7 days
apart, 6 participants completed them 8 days apart, and 1
participant completed them 6 days apart. During one
session, children completed the categorization tasks, diverse
beliefs task, knowledge access task, and language measures.
During the other session, they completed the expert
knowledge, day/night, contents false belief, diverse desires,
and dimensional change card sort task. The order of the
sessions was balanced across participants.

Results
Preliminary analyses showed no effect of session order on
children’s performance on any of the measures.
On the expert knowledge task, all three age groups
performed above chance on the near category items, ts ≥
4.916, ps ≤ .001 (Bonferroni corrected). The 4- and 5-year
olds performed above chance on the middle category items,
ts ≥ 4.294, ps ≤ .001 (Bonferroni corrected). The 5-year olds
also performed well on the underlying principles items,
t(17) = 2.701, p = .015, although this value was not
significant following the Bonferonni correction.
A 3(Item Type) X 3(Age Group) repeated-measures
ANOVA indicated significant main effects of Item Type, F
(2, 120) = 14.442, p < .001, ηp2 = .194, and Age, F (2, 60) =
3.148, p = .050, ηp2 = .095, but no significant interaction.
Post-hoc Bonferroni tests revealed that the effect of age was
driven by differences between 3- and 5-year-olds’ scores, p
= .045. Paired-samples t-tests collapsed across age revealed
significant differences between children’s scores on the near
and middle category items, t(62) = 3.386, p = .001, and
between the near and underlying principles items, t(62) =
5.432, p < .001. There was also a marginally significant
difference between scores on middle and underlying
principles items, t(62) = 1.926, p = .059.
Treating children’s exact age (calculated at the first
session) as a continuous variable showed a strong positive

2099

correlation with performance on all measures, except for
standardized language scores, as expected (see Table 1).
Thus, we positioned age and language as predictor variables
in our model. Since the literature clearly links age to EF, we
inserted it as a mediating variable between age and our
mediators of interest, ToM and CA, whose influences on
children’s performance on near, middle, and underlying
principles we attempted to predict (see Figure 1). Path
analysis revealed that age was a positive predictor of EF,
ToM, and CA, and that PPVT scores predicted CA, but not
ToM. Surprisingly, ToM was not a significant predictor of
children’s performance on any of the expert knowledge task
categories. CA was a significant, and marginally significant,
positive predictor of performance on near and middle items,
respectively, but it did not predict performance on
underlying principles items. CA clearly predicted
performance on the expert knowledge task overall, but it did
not fully mediate the effects of age and language, and
language was only a marginally significant positive
predictor of performance on middle items. Generally, age
and CA were predictive of performance on the expert
knowledge task and language, EF, and ToM were not. The
model accounted for 23% of the variance in overall scores
on near items, F (5, 57) = 3.40, p = .009, 25% of the
variance in overall scores on middle items, F (5, 57) = 5.20,
p = .001, and 15% of the variance in overall scores on
middle items, F (5, 57) = 2.01, p = .091. For near and
middle category items, the model accounted for
significantly more variance than age alone (all ps < .05), but
the increase in predictive power that these additional
variables brought to predicting children’s scores on
underlying principles items was only marginally significant

(p = .106).

Discussion
Children’s ability to categorize objects predicted their
understanding of expert knowledge for near and middle
items, but not for items focused on underlying principles.
Deciding whom to consult for the answer to a question is an
inherently social judgment, but the current findings suggest
that this competency is also strongly grounded in an
understanding of the categorical association between a
person’s domain of expertise and the topic of the question.
Critically, CA, but not ToM, partially mediated age-related
improvements in understanding expertise, and also
independently predicted children’s performance. Thus,
categorization skills play a critical role in enabling children
to make sophisticated social judgments.
Children may have used a number of different strategies
to solve the categorization task. They could have relied on
the living kind/artifact distinction (e.g., a skunk and an eagle
are both alive), perceptual similarities (e.g., a yo-yo and a
bicycle both have circular parts), or generated other
conceptual associations. For example, although children
were not asked to explain their choices, a child who
incorrectly paired the elevator with the eagle spontaneously
explained that he did so because they both “go up.”
Regardless of how children paired the items in the
categorization task, there was no evidence that their choices
transferred directly to the expert knowledge task, nor did
children who completed the categorization task in the first
session show superior performance on the expert knowledge
task in the second session or vice versa.
There are a number of potential explanations for why

ToM was not a significant predictor in our model. One
possibility is that even though Wellman and Liu’s (2004)
scale is a well-accepted measure of ToM, the tasks focus on
children’s reasoning about beliefs and desires, typically as a
result of immediate access to information (e.g., knowing
what is inside a box). Perhaps children’s understanding of
expertise relies on a different aspect of theory of mind, in
that expertise involves acquisition of a large and persisting
body of knowledge. Thus, other measures of social
reasoning may be better predictors of how well children
make inferences about the division of cognitive labor.
Another explanation is that ToM, broadly construed, is
indeed tangential to understanding expertise, although
further research is necessary in order to confirm this
possibility. For example, employing the current study’s
methods with a group with impaired ToM, such as high
functioning children with autism, would provide an
excellent test case for the role of ToM in representing the
knowledge of others, as children with autism are typically
motivated to seek out information and their categorization
skills are largely intact despite their impaired social
cognition (Tager-Flusberg, 1985). If children with autism
draw conclusions similar to those of typical children about
expert knowledge, this would suggest that strong non-social
reasoning skills might compensate for, or even completely
circumvent, social cognitive deficits when making certain
types of social judgments.
Likewise, the non-significant role of EF in our model may
be a function of the EF measures we employed. Because
there were only two measures of EF and these measures
focused exclusively on inhibition and cognitive flexibility,
our EF data may not have accounted for all the skills
involved in ToM or understanding expertise. For instance,
working memory may also be an important component of
children’s understanding of expertise, as children must
maintain information about both experts in order to compare
them.
Although CA predicted children’s performance on
components of the expert knowledge task, CA did not
account for all of the variance in children’s performance. In
fact, the predictive power of CA was strongest for near
items, only marginally significant for middle items, and
non-significant for underlying principles items. Thus,
categorization appears to be most essential for inferring
what an expert knows when the topics in question are more
closely related to the expert’s topic of expertise.
Categorization is, however, less central to connecting more
distant topics that share common underlying principles.
Perhaps including measures that tap into how children
reason about expertise, such as asking them to provide
explanations for their choice of expert, would be a better
predictor of individual differences in these items. More
generally, although the current model accounts for a
significant proportion of the variance in children’s
performance, identifying other factors that underlie
individual differences in children’s ability to infer what an
expert knows remains a task for future research.

Nevertheless, the current findings suggest that any potential
framework for explaining children’s judgments about
information sources must acknowledge the contribution of
non-social reasoning skills on ostensibly social inferences
and intuitions.
Despite recent advances in research on the development
of social cognition and non-social cognitive skills, little
work has examined how these different types of skills may
synergize to allow children to generate sophisticated
judgments. Most studies of the division of cognitive labor
are exploratory, and focused on understanding how children
represent different kinds of information and informants.
This kind of work is necessary and it is valuable to the
mission of understanding how children represent knowledge
in the world around them, but this is perhaps the first
investigation designed to explore how more general social
and cognitive competencies related to children’s
understanding of the division of cognitive labor. Beyond
explaining developmental differences in children’s ability to
infer what experts are likely to know, the results presented
here demonstrate how non-social competencies can
influence decisions that, at face value, may appear to be
strictly social judgments. Hence, in order to fully understand
how children learn to navigate the social and informational
worlds, it is essential to consider the entire range of
component skills that may be involved.
