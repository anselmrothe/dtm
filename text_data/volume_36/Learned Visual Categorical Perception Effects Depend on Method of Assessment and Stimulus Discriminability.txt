                             Method
Participants
We recruited 290 participants through Amazon Mechanical
Turk (AMT)1, paying between $0.50 and $1.25 for
participation, depending on the projected length of the
experiment. Eight subjects were excluded from the analysis
because of a bug that allowed them to complete more than
one condition of the experiment, leaving 282 participants.
Materials
The experiment was developed using jsPsych, a software
library for building online experiments (de Leeuw, 2014).
Stimuli were cell-like shapes that varied on two dimensions,
shape and tail length. We generated two sets of stimuli: a
high discriminability (HD) set and a low discriminability
(LD) set. The LD stimuli had half as much variation as
corresponding HD stimuli. See Figure 1. The stimulus
space was 6x6 for both sets. The category boundary was
between the 3rd and 4th stimuli on the shape dimension.
Thus the shape dimension (chosen arbitrarily) was always
the relevant dimension for categorization, and the tail length
dimension was always irrelevant.
Procedure
Subjects were randomly assigned to one of twelve
conditions: 2 training type (control v. category training) X 2
stimulus sets (HD v. LD) X 3 type of assessment (XAB v.
same/different v. similarity). The N per condition ranged
from 20 to 28.
Training Subjects who were assigned to a training
condition completed an adaptive training protocol by
iterating through multiple blocks of training until all stimuli
were learned. In each block of the procedure, all 36 stimuli
were shown one at a time and categorized as either a ‘Tig’
or a ‘Bep’ by the participant. Subjects were told that they

no more than 3). The 1/n component serves to average the
differences that were summed over. Intuitively, this
measure is computing something similar to a slope of how
much the dependent variable changes as the distance on d1
changes. The value of this measure is large when changes
along the dimension produce correlated changes in the
dependent variable, i.e. increasing the distance along the
dimension (while holding the distance along the other
dimension constant) causes an improvement in
discriminability. We calculated the influence of the relevant
dimension at each value of the irrelevant dimension, and
vice versa. This calculation was performed for each subject
individually. We conducted six separate 2 (training type:
control v. category training) X 3 (distance on the constant
dimension: 0, 1, or 2) X 2 (stimulus set: high
discriminability v. low discriminability) ANOVAs, one for
each combination of the 3 types of assessment and 2
dimensions of influence (relevant or irrelevant).
   We found no significant changes in the influence of the
category relevant dimension as a result of training. We did
find some changes in the influence of the irrelevant
dimension as a function of training. For same/different
judgments we found a main effect of training, F(1, 82) =
12.47, p = 0.0007. Subjects who received category training
were less likely to be influenced by the category irrelevant
dimension. For similarity judgments, we found both a main
effect of training, F(1, 90) = 9.21, p = 0.003, and a training
X stimulus set interaction, F(1, 90) = 5.25, p = 0.02.
Subjects who received category training were less
influenced by the irrelevant dimension, and this effect was
stronger with the high discriminability stimuli. For the XAB
task, there were no significant changes in influence of the
irrelevant dimension as a result of training. See Figure 3.
                         Discussion
We found evidence of CP effects with all three tasks and
with both stimulus sets, but each combination of task and
stimulus set produced a somewhat different pattern of
results. Our specific findings were: (1) The influence of the
irrelevant dimension decreased for the same/different and
similarity tasks but not for the XAB task. (2) The high
discriminability stimulus set produced a compression effect
in the XAB task for stimuli varying on the relevant
dimension. This was the only task/stimulus set where such
an effect was observed. (3) The between vs. within category
pairs analysis also revealed an expansion effect, but only for
the similarity task.
  At a basic level, this supports the idea that learned CP
effects depend on the task by which they are assessed and to
a lesser extent on characteristics of the stimuli that are used.
The specific task-stimulus set combination not only affected

a compression effect, and in no case did category training
increase the influence of the relevant dimension. Here, it
seems likely that our choice of stimuli was a major factor.
We created stimuli that made it easy to attend to one
dimension and not the other, and the two dimensions were
not equally salient. Control subjects were influenced by the
relevant dimension far more than the irrelevant dimension
even without category training. Changes on the irrelevant
dimension may have been both harder to detect and easier to
ignore. This inadvertently created a scenario that was prone
to compression-like effects, but not expansion. However, if
true, this emphasizes the general conclusion that CP effects
are sensitive to stimulus design. Indeed, research by
Notman, Sowden, and Özgen (2005) shows expansion with
extremely      low-discriminability     stimuli     using     a
same/different task as a measure. We hypothesize that
decreasing the discriminability of our stimuli, or even just
making the far less discriminable tail dimension the relevant
dimension, should produce more, and more robust,
expansion effects, strengthening the same/different task
results shown in Figure 2 where the low discriminability
stimuli appear to show an expansion-like pattern.
   While the stimuli might have been biased to produce a
certain pattern of results, we still found different effects
using the different measures, indicating that tasks are an
important consideration in assessing CP.
   The similarity task was the only one to produce an
expansion like effect. Goldstone, Lippa, and Shiffrin (2001)
note that learning that two stimuli are in different categories
may reduce similarity ratings simply because the stimuli
belong to different groups. This might seem a fitting
explanation of our data given the lack of evidence that the
relevant dimension became more influential or
discriminable in any of our tasks, but it is clear from
previous research that using a similarity task is more
associated with compression than expansion effects (e.g.,
Livingston, Andrews, & Harnad, 1998; Livingston,
Andrews, & Dwyer, 2001). Other factors such as category
structure may mediate what kind of effect is observed with a
similarity rating task (Reppa & Pothos, 2013), potentially
explaining the apparent discrepancy between these results.
   The XAB and same/different tasks, though both speeded
perceptual judgment tasks, yielded very different patterns of
results. The same/different task showed a clear decrease in
the influence of the irrelevant dimension for trained
subjects, but there was no such change observed with the
XAB task. This may be because the XAB task forces
subjects to compare two different stimuli, which in some
cases vary only on the irrelevant dimension. Thus, in a case
where subjects have learned to ignore variation on the
irrelevant dimension, the XAB task would alert them to the
                                                                    Figure 3: Influence of relevant and irrelevant variation for
