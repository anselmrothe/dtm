In all conditions, willingness to accept test stimuli dropped monotonically as the test stimuli grew more dissimilar. There was little variation
in the willingness to generalize with changes in the type of stimulus or quantity of data. The presence of a memory aid did have an effect:

Figure 3: Fits of each individual to the grammar that best captures their pattern of responses. The y axis shows the proportion of people best
fit to that type of grammar, and the legend describes the five candidate grammars. Few people in any condition were best fit by the Incorrect
grammar, and most in all conditions were best fit by the two other grammars of greatest generality – Any order (which accepted stimuli in
which the elements could occur in any order) and Full CFG (which is the An Bm An grammar that generated the training stimuli). People’s
grammars do not change based on the quantity of stimuli (each type once (1 X) or ten times (10 X)) or the type of stimuli (INSCRIPTION or
DESIGN ). However, there was an effect of receiving a memory aid. When people did not rely on their own memory they generalized more
tightly: fewer favored the most general Any order grammar, and more favored the tightest grammars (Depth-limited and Observed).
