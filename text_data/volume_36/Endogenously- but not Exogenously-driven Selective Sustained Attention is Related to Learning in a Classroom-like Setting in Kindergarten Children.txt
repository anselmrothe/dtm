   Specifically, the proportion of fixations to distractors in
the Heterogeneous Distractors Condition was negatively
correlated with children’s learning scores on the immediate
post-test (r = -0.43, p = .05) and with their delayed post-test
learning scores (r = - .663, p < .005; see Figure 3). In other
words, greater proportion of fixations to distractors in this
condition corresponded to lowers scores in the classroom
learning task. In contrast, the proportion of fixations to
distractors in the Homogeneous Distractors Condition was
not significantly related to the immediate post-test learning
scores (r = -0.18, p = 0.42) or the delayed post-test scores (r
= - .328, p= .136).

   A similar pattern emerged when we analyzed tracking
response accuracy on the Track-It task: the more accurate
children were in identifying the last location visited by the
target in the Heterogeneous Distractors Condition, the
higher their immediate post-test learning scores were (r =
0.574, p = .01). The correlation between Track-It response
accuracy and delayed post-test scores was marginally
significant (r = .412, p = .051). These findings are presented
in Figure 3. At the same time, there was no significant
association between Track-It response accuracy in the                   Figure 3. Scatterplots depicting significant correlations
