Abstract

a dialogue gives rise to the observed effects. Veneziano and
Parisse (2010) have shed some light on this issue by showing
that contingent adult-child correspondences in verbal forms
influence the way in which children acquiring French learn to
produce verbs. Dale and Spivey (2005, 2006) have proposed
the use of techniques from recurrence quantification analysis
to investigate lexical and syntactic alignment between children and their caregivers, and have shown that sequences of
word classes occurring in temporal proximity within a dialogue are more strongly coordinated.
The work presented in this paper contributes to this line of
research. We propose a refined model for applying recurrence
analysis to dialogue data based on turns as the main temporal unit (rather than on sequences of word classes as done by
Dale and Spivey (2005, 2006)). This methodology is introduced in the next section. We then present our main analysis
conducted on naturally occurring child-adult dialogues from
the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000). We investigate
categorical coordination (at lexical and syntactic levels) and
also develop a method to quantify conceptual coordination.
This is followed up by a second experiment on adult-adult
dialogue data from the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey, Holliman, & McDaniel, 1992), which allows us to test the extent
to which our findings are specific to child-adult interaction or
are a general feature of conversational joint action.

Using corpus-based methods inspired by recurrence quantification analysis, we investigate the patterns that shape coordination in dialogue, in particular during the process of language acquisition. We show that the turn-by-turn temporal
development of conversation is a key factor influencing when
and how interlocutors match each other’s linguistic representations. Although there is continuity between child-adult and
adult-adult dialogue with respect to alignment of semantic representations, our results show important differences regarding
syntactic alignment in adjacent turns, with adults showing less
cross-speaker syntactic matches than expected by chance.

analysis; Recurrence analysis; Distributional semantics.

Introduction
As any other type of joint action, conversation requires coordination in real time. Interlocutors need to understand and
adequately react to each other’s contributions while taking
turns in speaking and they need to offer online feedback to
their partners on the success (or lack thereof) of the communicative process (H. Clark, 1996). This often gives rise to
interlocutors matching each other’s patterns of language use
(Brennan & Clark, 1996; Pickering & Garrod, 2004). In this
study we aim to further our understanding of the patterns that
shape coordination in dialogue, in particular during the process of language acquisition, by using corpus-based methods
to quantify the level of convergence between interlocutors.
It has often been noted that adults modify their language
when they talk to young children. Snow (1995) hypothesised
that child-directed speech is not only adapted to the child’s
overall level of development, but it is locally fine-tuned to
and contingent on the child’s linguistic behaviour during the
course of a dialogue. In our quantitative study, we address
the following research questions: (1) To what extent is convergence in child-adult dialogue influenced by local, turn-byturn dialogue mechanisms? (2) If local mechanisms are at
play, is convergence amongst child and adult speakers bidirectional? (3) Does the level of convergence change with development? (4) Does child-adult dialogue differ from adultadult dialogue with regard to convergence patterns?
Kunert, Fernández, and Zuidema (2011) found strong correlations between the complexity of the child’s and the adult’s
speech in a range of measures including lexical, syntactic, and
phonological features. The correlations remained significant
after controlling for the child’s age, thus suggesting that local
adaptation mechanisms are at play. However, their analysis
was not able to pinpoint in what way the local dynamics of

Turn-Based Cross-Recurrence
We construct cross-recurrence plots taking dialogue turns as
the basic units of analysis (in contrast to Dale and Spivey
(2005, 2006)). We consider a turn to be a stretch of speech
by one speaker, which may include more than one utterance. Thus, by definition, a two-party dialogue between interlocutors A and B consists of a series of alternating turns
. . . a, b, a, b. . . From this, we extract one turn sequence per
speaker (a1 , a2 , . . . , an and b1 , b2 , . . . , bn ), which we timeindex in order to retain the structure of the dialogue.1 A
cross-recurrence plot is an n × n grid where the x and y axes
correspond to each of the two interlocutors’ turn sequences.
Each cell represents a pair of turns (i, j), where i is the ith turn
by the participant in the x-axis and j is the jth turn by the participant in the y-axis. In the case of child-adult dialogue, we
always place the adult turn sequence along the x-axis of the
grid. To this two-dimensional grid, we add a third dimension:
1 For the sake of simplicity, if the same speaker starts and ends
the dialogue, we discard the last turn in order to end up with turn
sequences of the same length for each of the two interlocutors.

pair of turns in each point are similar (i.e., converge) given a
particular linguistic measure m.2
The software used to generate cross-recurrence plots and
to calculate similarity scores out of corpus data has been developed for the purpose of the present experiments. It is implemented in Python and it includes a GUI component written in Java to visually explore the plots. In the visualisation,
the convergence scores are represented with shades of grey.
White indicates there is no convergence while black indicates
convergence is maximal. Figure 1 shows a sample plot.

Recurrence Measures
subset of points in D where i > j (located in the lower half of
the plot, below the diagonal). We can thus derive two addi−
tional measures, RR+
d and RRd , by restricting the computation of RRd to points (i, j) with j > i and i > j, respectively.

The simplest information we can extract from a recurrence
plot is the global recurrence rate. This measure captures
the average amount of cross-participant recurrence found in a
conversation, ignoring the temporal structure of the dialogue.
It is computed by summing up all the recurrence values in
the plot and then dividing by the total number of points. In
addition, a recurrence plot allows us to quantify the degree
to which convergence is tied to the temporal contingency of
the turns contributed by the two dialogue participants. Points
corresponding to pairs of turns (i, j) with the same time index i = j (i.e., points in the diagonal line of incidence) are
always immediately adjacent in the dialogue. As we move
away from the diagonal, the recurrence points correspond to
pairs of turns that are further apart in the dialogue.3 We are
interested in quantifying the level of recurrence found close
to the diagonal. For this we consider the average amount of
cross-participant recurrence in points found up to distance d
from the diagonal line of incidence. If, for instance, d = 3, we
consider all points within a region of up to distance 3 above
and below the diagonal. Let D be the set of points in the diagonal region determined by d. The local recurrence rate RRd
with d < n is computed as follows:
RRd

=

Control Dialogues
In order to investigate the extent to which the turn-byturn structure of a dialogue influences the degree of crossparticipant recurrence, we need a control condition that accounts for the amount of recurrence that would be expected
by chance regardless of the temporal structure of the conversation. We follow a strategy similar to that used in previous studies (Dale & Spivey, 2006; Howes, Healey, & Purver,
2010): For each original dialogue, we create a shuffled control
dialogue where we keep the turns by one speaker unchanged
and randomly shuffle the turns by the other speaker (see Figure 1). By definition, the global recurrence rate (equivalent
to RRn ) will be the same regardless of dialogue type (original
vs. shuffled). The shuffled control dialogues, however, offer a baseline for the level of local recurrence rate RRd (with
d < n) that could be expected by chance.

Methods
Like Chouinard and Clark (2003) and Dale and Spivey (2005,
2006), our data was drawn from the following three English
corpora in the CHILDES Database (MacWhinney, 2000):
Abe from the Kuczaj corpus, Sarah from the Brown corpus,
and Naomi from the Sachs corpus. We selected all dialogue
transcripts from each of these three corpora where the child
utterances had a minimum mean length of 2 words. Table 1
gives an overview of the data used in the analysis.
We created a shuffled control dialogue for each transcript
in the corpora and generated cross-recurrence plots for all dialogues. Each point (i, j) in a plot corresponds to a pair of
turns, one by the caregiver and one by the child. Since the
caregiver’s turns are always situated along the x-axis of the
plot, i stands for the temporal index for the caregiver’s turn
while j stands for that of the child.4

Finally, a recurrence plot also allows us to investigate whether
the observed recurrence has a directionality. For instance,
if the adult adapts to the child more than the child does to
the adult, we would expect to find more recurrence in pairs
of turns where the child’s turn temporally precedes the caregiver’s turn. And vice versa if it is mostly the child’s speech
that resembles earlier speech by the adult. The information
encoded in the plot can easily be exploited to capture these
notions. Since the child’s turns are always located on the yaxis of the plot, the subset of recurrence points in D where
j > i (located in the upper half of the plot, above the diagonal
line of incidence) correspond to pairs of turns where the child
speaks after the adult, while the opposite is the case for the
2 We follow Angus, Smith, and Wiles (2012) in using real values
rather than Boolean ones as done by Dale and Spivey (2006).
3 Note that either points (i, i − 1) or (i, i + 1) will also correspond
to adjacent turns when the child or the adult, respectively, have uttered the first turn in the dialogue.

4 Adults other than the child’s mother may sporadically take part
in a dialogue. When this is the case, we consider all adult turns as
contributed by one (general) caregiver participant.

Measures of Categorical Convergence. We investigated
the following two categorical aspects:
Lexical convergence. To quantify lexical convergence we
use two measures: the number of shared lexeme unigrams
and the number of shared lexeme bigrams. We consider a
lexeme to be a pair consisting of a stem and a part-of-speech
tag, e.g. hcat, nouni. A lexeme bigram is thus a sequence of
two such lexemes, e.g. hgrey, adjihcat, nouni. For a pair of
turns (i, j), we compute the number of lexemes (or lexeme
bigrams) which appear in both turns and normalise it by the
number of lexemes (or lexeme bigrams) in the longer turn.
Lexical convergence is maximal (value 1) only when the two
turns contain exactly the same lexemes.

the meanings of two expressions are, such as computing the
cosine of the angle formed by their corresponding vectors.
We use the WaCuk corpus—a freely available 2-billionword corpus of English gathered from the Web (Baroni,
Bernardini, Ferraresi, & Zanchetta, 2009)—to build a semantic model from which we can extract vectors for the content stems (noun, adjective, and verb types) in our CHILDES
data. For each of the three CHILDES corpora, we extract the
10,000 noun, adjective, and verb stems from the WaCuk corpus that most frequently occur in the same sentence as the
target stems in the relevant CHILDES corpus. This generates
large semantic spaces with 10,000-dimensional vectors. Using the DISSECT toolkit (Dinu, Pham, & Baroni, 2013), we
process this space by (a) removing the 50 target stems that
appear most frequently in the WaCuk corpus (since very frequent stems are less informative), (b) normalising the vectors
by their length, (c) weighting their elements using Mutual Information, and (d) reducing the number of dimensions to 300
by applying singular value decomposition.5 This produces
manageable but powerful semantic models from which we
can extract vector-based conceptual representations for our
target stems in the CHILDES data.

Syntactic convergence. We capture syntactic convergence
with two measures that consider sequences of part-of-speech
(POS) classes: the number of shared POS bigrams and the
number of shared POS trigrams. In order to disentangle
syntactic from lexical coordination, we only take into account POS sequences where the lexical stems are not identical
across turns. For instance, if the sequence h , adjih , nouni
is found in both turns (i, j), this will increment the POS bigram measure only if the stems in the bigram are not the same
in i and j. This contrasts with the approach by Dale and
Spivey (2005, 2006) where lexical recurrence is not factored
out from syntactic recurrence.

Conceptual convergence. To compute the degree of conceptual convergence between a pair of turns (i, j), we first obtain
a semantic vector for each turn by adding up the vectors corresponding to the content stems present in the turn, and then
calculate the cosine of the angle formed by the two turn vectors. The convergence score corresponds to the cosine value
if the cosine is positive, and to 0 otherwise.

Measures of Conceptual Convergence. The measures of
convergence we have defined above are restricted to categorical overlap, i.e. identity matches at the lexical and syntactic
levels of linguistic representation. We are also interested in
applying more subtle measures that allow us to quantify the
degree of conceptual similarity between related but possibly
different expressions. For instance, an utterance containing
the verb “bark” is likely to be more semantically related to
an utterance with the noun “dog” than to an utterance with
the noun “telephone.” To develop a measure of conceptual
convergence that captures such abstract relationships, we exploit powerful natural language processing techniques.

Results
We calculated recurrence values for each point (i, j) in the
dialogue plots for the categorical and conceptual convergence
measures defined above.
An ANOVA with d and dialogue type as within-subjects
factors reveals a reliable difference in recurrence rate between
original and control dialogues, a significant main effect of the
distance parameter d, and a significant interaction between d
and dialogue type for all linguistic measures. This is reliably
the case for the three children considered (p < .01 across all
measures and children). Table 2 gives a summary of results
for Abe.6 The graphs in Figure 2 show the average recurrence
rate in actual dialogues and in shuffled control dialogues at

Semantic model. A distributional semantic model is a highdimensional vector space where words are represented as vectors that record the frequency with which they occur in different linguistic contexts in a corpus. These semantic spaces—
of which LSA (Landauer & Dumais, 1997) is a well-known
example—make mathematically precise the so-called distributional hypothesis according to which expressions with similar meanings tend to occur in similar contexts. Such models
allow us to use well-defined methods to measure how similar

Results
For the semantic measures (categorical and conceptual), the
pattern of results obtained in the adult data is similar to the
one observed in child-adult interaction: We find a reliable difference in recurrence rate between the original and the control dialogues, a main effect of distance d, and an interaction
between d and dialogue type. Interestingly, the results are
different for the syntactic measures (POS bi- and trigrams).
Regarding shared POS bigrams, there is a significant effect
of locality and dialogue type, but we find less (rather than
8 Backchannels are particularly frequent in the Switchboard corpus (19% of all utterances), possibly as a side effect of the telephone
medium, which prevents feedback via eye gaze or head nods.

For POS trigrams, there is an effect of distance but no significant difference between dialogue types (original vs. shuffled).

The results of our second analysis allow us to conclude that
the turn-by-turn local level of dialogue interaction has a significant impact on patterns of recurrence beyond the case of
child-adult dialogue. This is by no means a new observation
for adult dialogue, for which local coordination is well attested and a key aspect of dialogue theories (see e.g., H. Clark
10(1996); Pickering and Garrod (2004)). There is however a
caveat regarding the kind of impact we observe: While in
both child-adult dialogue and adult-adult dialogue semantic
convergence is significantly higher the closer the turns are in
the temporal dialogue sequence, in adult dialogue there is less
syntactic recurrence in adjacent turns that would be expected
by chance, given the baseline provided by the shuffled control
dialogues.
These results are puzzling, not only in contrast to the childadult results from our previous analysis but also, and perhaps
especially, given the relatively large amount of experiments
that have offered evidence of syntactic alignment across adult
interlocutors (see Pickering and Ferreira (2008) for a review).
In a recent corpus-based study, however, Howes et al. (2010)
have suggested that “the ubiquity of syntactic priming may
have been overstated.” They point out that often experiments
on syntactic convergence fail to account for the degree of
alignment that would be expected by chance. Howes et al. examined the dative alternation construction—a commonly
studied syntactic construction in alignment experiments—in
a corpus of 127 dialogues amongst two adult participants.
They used a methodology to create control dialogue similar to the one we have employed here and found that there
was not reliably more syntactic matching that would occur
by chance. Our results are in line with these findings and are
in fact stronger since we found a reliable effect of syntactic
divergence in immediately adjacent turns.
The reasons behind this are unclear, but we suspect they
may be related to a difference in feedback patterns and feedback functions between children and adults. In child-adult
dialogue, recurrence appears to be used as a feedback mechanism for acknowledging, reformulating, or ratifying—not

only meanings but also linguistic forms. In adult-adult dialogue, form and structure are much less of an issue and,
thus, although syntactic convergence may occur due to priming effects, it is not typically used as a feedback mechanism
beyond lexical overlap. Instead, to provide evidence of understanding, adult dialogue participants will tend to offer an
appropriate next contribution (such as an answer to a question, which is likely to show semantic recurrence but will display a markedly different syntactic pattern), or to issue an
acknowledgement with no apparent recurrence. This latter
point becomes more evident if backchannels are considered
turns (rather than being ignored as in our analysis): In such
case, the divergence is much more pronounced and reliably
affects both syntactic and lexical recurrence rates.

Conclusions
Our analyses confirm that the local, turn-by-turn temporal development of dialogue is a key factor in explaining the coordination patterns that characterise linguistic interaction between young children and adults, which corroborates finetuning accounts of child-adult dialogue (Snow, 1995). This
is in line with the local coordination that characterises adult
conversational joint action. However, our results regarding
syntactic convergence show that, while locality matters for
both children and adults, the convergence patterns themselves
may be different in these two kinds of dialogue: Child-adult
dialogue exhibits significant cross-speaker syntactic recurrence at temporally close turns, while adult-adult dialogue
shows less cross-speaker syntactic matches in adjacent turns
than expected by chance. This contrasts with previous results
on adult conversation (Pickering & Ferreira, 2008) and thus
calls for a deeper investigation of syntactic alignment patterns
in adult dialogue interaction.
We point up that any comparisons between our results in
analysis 1 and analysis 2 should be taken with caution given
the different dialogue settings in each of the two corpora
used: physical co-presence in CHILDES vs. telephone mediation in Switchboard. Barring any confounding effects due
to these difference (which we believe are unlikely given our
manipulation of backchannels), overall we observe lower levels of recurrence for all linguistic measures in the adult-adult
data than in the child-adult dialogues, relative to what is expected to occur by chance independently in each case. There
must therefore be a decline in recurrence with developmental change, even though the longitudinal data available in the
CHILDES corpora did not allow us to confirm this for all children. Further analysis is needed to understand in detail how
this change takes place, as well as to quantitatively investigate the extent to which local convergence may contribute to
boost learning during language acquisition.
