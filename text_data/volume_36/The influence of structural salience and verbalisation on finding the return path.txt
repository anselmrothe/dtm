return path, however, it might be important that a landmark
is located either at position A or D. This might be because
of the invariance of these positions, i.e. they remain un-
changed for the return path and may lead to an advantage in
a wayfinding task. This does not apply for the landmark
positions B and C. These positions are variant and have to
be mentally/verbally transformed on the return path (see
