can be seen from Table 1, there were two sentences for each
tense condition; this counterbalancing ensured that each
object was once the target of both a past and future action.
In turn, this ensured that visual characteristics of any given
post-verbal target object contributed equally to each critical
condition. Importantly, the two objects mentioned in an item
could be equally plausible targets of the action expressed by
the verb (e.g. both cucumbers and tomatoes can be
flavored). The words in a sentence were matched for spoken
syllables and lemma frequency within an item (Baayen et
al., 1995).
  For every item we recorded two videos, each lasting in
average of 5015 ms. The scene for both videos always
