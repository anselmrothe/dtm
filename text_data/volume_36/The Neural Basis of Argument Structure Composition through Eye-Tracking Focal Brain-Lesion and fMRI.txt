We investigate the processing and neurological basis of Light          LVCs (light verb constructions) such as The girl gives a kiss

Discussion
The results are consistent with the prediction of composition-
ality associated with the underspecified semantics analysis,
and not with the empty-semantics analysis. According to this
prediction, LVCs demand that the underspecified argument
structure (AS) associated with the verb and the AS associated
with the object be composed into a larger event representation
as comprehension unfolds. Argument structure composition
is independently associated with the workings of the LIF cor-
tex, Brocas patients exhibit focal lesions in that cortical re-
gion exclusively. Consequently Brocas patients should show
impaired performance in the interpretation of LVCs. This
was indeed the case. Patients with Broca’s aphasia performed
worse in comprehension of LVCs than Wenickes. Moreover,
performance seems to improve as severity of the deficit is re-
duced (mild Brocas > moderate Brocas). This same cortical
