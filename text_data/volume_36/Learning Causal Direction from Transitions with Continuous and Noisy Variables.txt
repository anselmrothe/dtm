   Our main question of interest is whether people are able

data with ordinal values similar to Table 2 Experiment 1.
We call this condition “temporally dependent” because X
and Y often remain in the same state from trial to trial.
However, in creating the sequences of learning data, since
there are ΔY transitions but no ΔX transitions, in the long
run, Y has higher variance than X. Restated, there is a
confound in that there are two differences between X and Y.
One difference is that there are ΔY but there are no ΔX
transitions, and the other is that the variance of Y is often
greater than the variance of X.
   In order to ensure that the causal direction inference is
due to the asymmetry in ΔX and ΔY, we also ran a
“temporally independent” condition using the exact same            Figure 1: Sample stimuli for Experiment 1. Note: actual
