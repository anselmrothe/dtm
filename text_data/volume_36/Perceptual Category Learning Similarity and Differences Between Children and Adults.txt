However, the question remains: how would children per-

                       Experiment 1
  In Experiment 1 we extended the research of Minda &
Miles (2009) to examine the relative differences between
children’s and adults’ category learning abilities and styles.
Similar to Minda & Miles, we asked participants to learn
two five-dimensional categories that could be learned per-
fectly by the verbal system, using a verbalizable rule based
on a single dimension (the criterial attribute, CA) or by the
implicit system by using a strategy based on the family re-
semblance of category members. Our study differed from
Minda & Miles, in that we designed a set of stimuli with
features that children rated as being approximately equal in
salience. Additionally, we created a single-feature test in           Figure 1: This is an example of the training items for each

block, for a total of 50 trials.
  On each trial, a picture of a fish appeared in the middle of
the screen and pictures of the two category labels (aquarium
or fishbowl) were shown in the top left and right corners of
the screen. On each trial, participants clicked on the fish’s
category label. Correct responses were indicated with a
green check mark displayed in the center of the screen for 3
seconds and incorrect responses were indicated with a red
X. In addition, the correct category label was circled during
this period regardless of whether the response was correct or
incorrect.
  Upon completion of the 50 training trials, participants
were told that they would be seeing some additional fish and
that they should help the fish find their homes using what
they had learned during the training phase. The transfer
stage consisted of two blocks of 10 stimuli in which the 10
training stimuli and the 10 novel transfer stimuli were
shown once each in random order (see transfer stimuli in
Figure 1). Each trial followed the same sequence of events
as in the training stage except that no feedback was given.
  Participants then completed the single feature phase and
were shown each individual feature of the fish (e.g., a
straight tail, a pointed mouth, etc.) on the computer screen
one at a time and they indicated in which category the fea-
ture was most often found by clicking on either the fish
bowl or aquarium. The single feature phase consisted of one
block of 10 trials and as in the transfer phase, feedback was
not given.

averaging performance for each age group at each block.

Method
Subjects 20 adults were recruited from the University of
Western Ontario and 17 children (8 male, 9 female) were
recruited from the University Laboratory School at the Uni-
versity of Western Ontario. Children were all between 4 and
5 years old and the mean age was 4.53 (SD = .26). The data
from one child was excluded because that child had diffi-
culty understanding the task.
Materials The dot-distortion task was created with a well-
established method that generates a family of dot patterns
from a single prototype. The distortions were similar to, but
not exactly like, the originating prototype. Small adjust-
ments to the location of some dots resulted in items that
were “low distortions” of the prototype, and large adjust-
ments resulted in “high distortions”. We connected the dots
to form irregular, 9-point polygons. The training set con-
sisted of the prototype, 20 low-level distortions, 20 high-         Figure 3: Performance of children and adults on the four
