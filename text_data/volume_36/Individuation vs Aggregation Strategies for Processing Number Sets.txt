variance types, either 10% (low variance) or 20% (high
variance) of the set mean. This helped eliminate patterns,

participant strategies were inferred from their self-reports.              number of fixations increased along with set size.
The strategy that was most often reported was to “just get a
sense of the numbers”, which appears to have been used as a
catch-all answer. Experiment 3 was a pilot study providing                         100%

press). Given these results, we expected to see evidence that
participants erroneously recognized set means, rather than
actual values, particularly when set sizes were larger than
four. Our results suggest that task demands (e.g.,
recognizing a specific number in a set rather than comparing
two sets) and strategies influence number recognition. For
example, participants in all three experiments correctly
recognized numbers from sets at levels greater than chance
even as set size grew.
   Our results provide evidence that participants were using
diagnostic strategies that supported individuation rather than
aggregation. For example, focusing on the tens or ones
column when recognizing a three-digit number in a set of
numbers may provide more information about unique
features than the hundreds column.
   In addition, reaction time for sets of six was related to a
diagnostic strategy when time was not a factor, suggesting
that we may have an easier time individuating larger sets
when processing constrains are eased. In summary, our
results suggest that sets larger than four are effectively
individuated with diagnostic strategies and confidence in
strategy use was indicative of number recognition
performance. Future research should include the collection
of eye tracking data with more variations of the number set
task, including the inclusion of distracter tasks and new task
goals.
