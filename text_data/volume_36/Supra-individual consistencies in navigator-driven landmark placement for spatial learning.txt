this cognitive effort limits potential advantages of
individually placed landmarks for the development of
survey knowledge. Moreover, the findings of Shelton and
McNamara (2004) imply that a task involving landmarks
may result in a landmark-centered orientation strategy.
Thus, the facilitation of spatial learning by individually
placed landmarks may be more pronounced in a setting that
requires route knowledge.
   Taken together, the present research addresses the
following questions: First, does the placement of landmarks
at individually chosen places in an environment support the
development of a mental map of this environment (Study 1),
respectively the ability to locate specific locations in a
wayfinding task (Study 2)? Second, can we identify supra-
individual strategies and patterns in the placement of
landmarks in both scenarios?
                           Study 1
   Study 1 examined whether individually placed landmarks
support the development of a mental map of an
environment. In order to avoid floor effects, we decided to
use artificial but rather simple environments. One group of            Figure 1: Layouts of the environments used in Study 1
