the experimenter thought and said out loud that she was the
best in this game. The confederate did this when the
experimenter was absent, because she had to leave the room

twice in the deceptive condition, the only difference being
that during the first lying condition the experimenter lost the
game (after the final question) and guessed the object
wrongly; while in the second lying condition, despite what
the child described, the experimenter guessed the object
correctly. The reason for having two lying conditions was
