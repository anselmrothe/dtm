Notes . 1. These three units (Trait C) in the output layer did not receive a target signal (error derivertive was zero) in a superficial contact condition.
        2. Trait F represents the highly overlapping category in the low complexity ingroup.
        3. In the Asian cultural trend model, one of the five behavior units was randomly selected' per 18 trials (18 succesive exemplars)
             whereas in the Western cultural trend model, one unit was randomly selected per every trial/exemplar.
