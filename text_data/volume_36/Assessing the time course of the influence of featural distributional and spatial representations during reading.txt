The purpose of the present research is two-folded; first, we

The second question is based on recent evidence from eye

difference) between abstract nouns (Guerra & Knoeferle,

Data Analysis 1
Based on previous findings (see Guerra & Knoeferle, 2012),
we defined three critical regions in the sentences (i.e., the
NP2, ADJ and the VP2). Before computing reading
measures, we removed all fixations longer than 1200 or
shorter than 80 ms (cf. Sturt, Keller, & Dubey, 2010).
Subsequently, we calculated three reading measures for
each critical sentence. First-pass reading time was defined
as the sum of all fixations from first entering a region until      Figure 2: Mean first-pass reading time (on the left) and

Discussion
Previous findings showed that spatial distance could rapidly
interact with the interpretation of semantic similarity
between abstract nouns (e.g., war, peace) as reflected by
sentence reading times (Guerra & Knoeferle, 2012). In the
present study, we extended these results from abstract to
concrete nouns. As can be seen in Figure 2, first-pass and
regression path reading times were longer for sentences
expressing similarity between concrete nouns when
preceded by a visual context with objects far apart (vs. close
together), while reading times for sentences expressing
dissimilarity were longer when preceded by object close
together (vs. far apart). We thus replicated the previously-          Figure 3: Pearson correlation between featural (McRae et
