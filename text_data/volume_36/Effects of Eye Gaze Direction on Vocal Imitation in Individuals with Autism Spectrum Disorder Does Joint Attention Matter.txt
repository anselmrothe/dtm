Method
Participants Thirty-two participants (28 male, 4
female, divided equally per group), half of them                     (b)
diagnosed with autism and the other half representing a
control group, were recruited for the study. The control
group matched the ASD group on age, education and
gender (for ASD: Mean Age = 37.9, SD = 13.4, age
range 21-67; for Control: Mean Age = 36.6, SD = 15.4,
age range 18-69).1 The uneven number of male and                     (c)
female participants is due to the fact that autism is
more common in males than in females (Tesink, 2013).
