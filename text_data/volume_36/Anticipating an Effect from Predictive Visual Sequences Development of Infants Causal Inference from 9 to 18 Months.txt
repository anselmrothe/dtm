   Eye tracking data were analyzed to extract predictive gaze
shifts (PGS), defined as directing the point of gaze away
from the frame displaying the shape sequences toward the
reward’s frame 200 ms or less prior to the actual onset of
the reward (inferred to be anticipatory). The 200-ms
criterion was based on the estimated time to program an eye
movement (Gredebäck, Johnson, & von Hofsten, 2010).
Gaze shifts to the reward’s frame that were completed after
200 ms past its onset were not classified as PGS (inferred to
be reactive). For each subject, we computed the difference
between the number of PGS for true trials and for false
trials. We used this PGS difference score as an indicator of
how well the infants learned what sequences predicted the
effect.
   We hypothesized that (1) older infants would produce
more PGS for true vs, false trials (higher PGS difference        Figure 3: Differences in predictive gaze shifts (PGS) in true

        Figure 5 shows the model’s performance as a function of
𝛽, the degree to which simple causes are favored, when
𝜃 = 1 (i.e., perfect shape identification).   When 𝛽 < 0,
favoring simple causes, the model achieves the best
performance in the C condition, followed by BC, then ABC
(the latter two track closely in the range −1 < 𝛽 < 0),
consistent with older infants’ performance as shown in
Figure 3. However, when 𝛽 > 0, indicating a bias favoring
longer shape sequences (as used in Buchsbaum et al., 2011),
the model predicts the opposite pattern, with the ABC
condition yielding the best performance, and the C condition
the worst. Accordingly, we conclude that a negative 𝛽,
favoring simple causes with shorter shape sequences, is
essential to account for the overall main effect of better
performance for infants in the C condition relative to ABC.
        We also examined the influence on model performance of
the second model parameter, 𝜃, the probability of correct
shape-matching. We assume that infants are able to identify
shapes better (i.e., adopt higher 𝜃 values) with increasing
age. Figure 6 depicts the model performance as a function of                                                                                         Figure 6: Model results. The expected frequencies of PGS
