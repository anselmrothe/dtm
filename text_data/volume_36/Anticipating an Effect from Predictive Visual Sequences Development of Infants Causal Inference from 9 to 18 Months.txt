Abstract

Causal Inference in Infants

Teinonen et al., 2009) and motion-based causal perception
given spatial and temporal contiguity (Leslie & Keeble,
1987). By 18-24 months, children begin to expect
predictable effects from learned sequences of discrete causal
events (Bonawitz et al., 2010), and by 24-48 months, they
routinely use the covariation patterns between actions and
state changes to categorize objects by causal power and
predict the effects of causal actions (Gopnik & Sobel, 2000).
How do infants progress from the perceptual mechanisms
of early infancy (statistical and rule-based learning and
motion-based causal perception) to the extraction of causal
structure from temporal covariation between discrete
events? Little is known about learning processes in infancy
that support causal inference. Research on causal inference
in children under 18 months of age has been limited because
the tasks typically used, such as the “blicket” detector
paradigm (Gopnik & Sobel, 2000), require vocal ability
and/or motor skills. It has been difficult, therefore, to
characterize infants’ development of causal learning,
leaving open the issue of whether early motion-based causal
perception is generalized to higher-order causal inference
(Michotte, 1946/1963), or whether the former is merely a
special case of the latter (Cheng, 1993).
Causal inferences are necessarily constrained by limits in
perception, attention, and memory. In particular, potential
causal cues and their temporal ordering must be determined
before statistical computation can proceed. The literature on
animal conditioning is consistent with an inherent
connection between detection of causal cues and causal
inference. For example, Balleine et al. (2005) showed that
increased perceptual discriminability of cues enhances rats’
ability to acquire cause-effect associations, influencing
sophisticated behavior such as retrospective revaluation of
cues. We would expect, therefore, that development of
causal inference is constrained by infants’ perceptual
processing maturity and working memory capacity, as well
as the identification of conditional probabilities involved in
predicting an effect. Our experiment and our model
represent a first step in understanding developments in
causal inferences from probabilistic information during this
important transitional age range, as well as the perceptual
and cognitive constraints on the learning process.

Previous research has shown that infants make remarkable
progress in acquiring sophisticated inferential abilities in the
first two years after birth. Within the first few months, for
example, infants demonstrate statistical learning in multiple
sensory modalities (Frank et al., 2009; Kirkham, Slemmer,
& Johnson, 2002; Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996;

An experiment by Buchsbaum et al. (2011) with 41- to 70month-old children provides a paradigm that we adapted to
create a causal inference task that can be performed by
younger infants. The children in Buchsbaum et al.’s study

There has been little research on infants’ development of
causal inference in the second year after birth. We report an
experiment in which 9- to 18-month-old infants viewed visual
sequences consisting of three looming shapes, one after
another. Half of the sequences (causes) were predictive of an
attention-getting reward (effect), and the other half were nonpredictive. The statistical complexity of predictive sequences
was varied between conditions. We analyzed latencies of
infants’ eye movements toward the reward location. Older
infants yielded more anticipatory eye movements in
predictive than non-predictive sequences. Effects of both
infant age and complexity of causal sequences were observed.
To qualitatively account for these findings, we formulated a
Bayesian model based on generic priors favoring simple
causal events coupled with noisy shape identification.

Introduction
Understanding cause-effect relations is vital to cognitive
development. Imagine, for example, an infant attempting to
disambiguate his mother’s actions as she starts up the car,
adjusts the mirror, scans the surroundings, engages first
gear, and turns the steering wheel, at which point the car
moves. How do infants make sense of such causal action
sequences? How do they determine which actions are
necessary, and in which order, to produce an effect? How do
they use this knowledge to guide their own actions?
We address these questions with a combination of
behavioral and computational evidence. We report an
experiment in which infants observe causal action sequences
for which cause-effect relations are specified by conditional
probabilities of varying complexity, and we describe a
Bayesian model that simulates the inferences that support
identification of causal structure. We reasoned that
identifying causal structure incorporates multiple sources of
information (e.g., spatiotemporal, statistical) and
perceptual/cognitive mechanisms (e.g., visual attention,
detection of serial order, working memory, inherent biases)
that must operate in concert during the learning process.

Paradigm

1976

observed an adult performing a series of five 3-action
sequences on a toy (e.g., knocking, stretching, rolling), such
that certain sequences were followed by a desirable outcome
(a musical jingle). Afterwards, the children were given the
toy, and asked to reproduce the effect.
Three conditions were examined, varying the statistical
complexity of causes. In the ABC condition, the music
played only when a specific set of three actions (A, B, and
C) were performed in order; in the BC condition, the music
played whenever the final two actions (B and C) were
performed in order, regardless of what action was performed
in the first position; and in the C condition, the music played
after every sequence (all sequences ended in action C, but
the first and second positions varied).
The results of the experiment demonstrated that when
given the toy, significantly more children in the BC and C
conditions were willing to imitate shorter action sequences
that had never been shown in isolation, rather than a 3action sequence as they had been shown during learning.
The children appeared to infer the conditional probabilities
between the actions that are predictive of the effect, and
used that information to make rational choices about which
actions performed by the adult needed to be imitated in
order to produce the effect. These results, and the Bayesian
model formulated by Buchsbaum et al. (2011), suggest that
the children combined this conditional probability
information (statistical learning) with prior beliefs about
causal events in making decisions to imitate specific actions.

Experiment
The goal of our study was to investigate perceptual and
cognitive constraints on infants’ learning of causal action
sequences, in particular developments related to
identification of conditional probabilities governing causal
structures. To examine the development of causal inference
in infants, we combined methods from studies of statistical
learning (e.g., Kirkham et al., 2002) with a perceptual
analog of the causal inference paradigm described
previously (Buchsbaum et al., 2011). We presented infants
with 48 sequences of three looming, colored shapes that
were predictive (or not) of the appearance of an attractive
“reward,” a colorful, animated attention-getting stimulus
shortly after the final shape’s offset. We operationalized the
learning of causal structure as a greater tendency to
anticipate the reward (using eye movements as the
dependent measure) in true (predictive of the reward) vs.
false (non-predictive) sequences, and we examined the time
course of learning in each condition across trials.
Statistical learning experiments involve passive detection
of conditional probabilities from a continuous stimulus
stream. Our approach differs by requiring the detection of
cues’ statistical regularity in predicting a reward that is
qualitatively and spatially distinct from the cues themselves.
This design and the use of an eye tracker allow us to study
the mechanisms characteristic of causal inference in a
younger age range than what has been previously reported
outside of motion-based causal perception.

Method
Participants Sixty-three infants (31 female), ranging from
9- to 18-months-old (M age = 13.6 months), were recruited
from a database of new parents and tested at the University
of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Baby Lab. An
additional 28 infants were observed but eliminated from
data analysis due to excessive fussiness (13), inattention
(12), or experimenter error (3). Infants were given a toy as a
thank-you gift in exchange for participation in the
experiment. Twenty-five infants were assigned to the ABC
condition, 19 to the BC condition, and 19 to the C condition
(described subsequently).
Procedure Infants were seated in a parent’s lap; the adult
was instructed not to interact with the infant or look at the
stimulus monitor. Infants were placed 60 cm from the
monitor. Eye movements were recorded with an SR
EyeLink 1000 (SR Research, Ltd) at 500 hz.
The computer screen displayed two gray square frames,
9.4 cm per side (9.0˚ at the 60-cm viewing distance), sideby-side on a black background and separated by 8.6 cm
(8.2˚) (Figure 1). One frame (the left in Figure 1, but
counterbalanced across subjects) was designated for the
shape sequences, while the frame on the other side
displayed the reward (when applicable). The shapes were
presented for 750 ms each (2250 ms for the total sequence),
followed by a 750-ms interstimulus interval (ISI) after the
third shape. For the trials with the reward (true trials), a
dynamic attention-getter appeared after the ISI in the
opposite frame for 1500 ms. Example videos available:
http://www.babylab.ucla.edu/index.php?page=causal-action.
Analogously to the paradigm employed by Buchsbaum et
al. (2011), each infant was randomly assigned to one of
three conditions: ABC, BC, or C. These conditions
correspond to the number and position of the shapes that
were predictive of the reward (Figure 2). In the ABC
condition, all 24 true sequences consisted of the same three
shapes in the same positions, such that shape A was always
first, shape B second, and shape C third. In the BC
condition, the 24 true sequences consisted of 8 trials each of
ABC, DBC, and EBC, such that only shapes B and C in the
second and third positions (respectively) predicted the
reward (i.e., the first position’s shape was variable). In the C

conditional probabilities in BC and multiple sets of
conditional probabilities in ABC.

(randomized each trial).
condition, the 24 true sequences all ended with shape C in
the third position, but the first two positions were randomly
sampled (without replacement).
For all three conditions, the 24 false sequences were
random permutations of the 5 shapes (A-E) with the
constraints that in the BC condition there were no BCx trials
(i.e., B and C did not appear consecutively except in the
second and third positions), and in the C condition, there
were no Cxx or xCx trials (i.e., C did not appear outside the
third position). Shapes were never repeated within a trial
(e.g., there were no AAC or BDB trials) for either true or
false sequences. The 48 sequences were presented in a
randomized order.
For each infant, shapes were randomly assigned to role A,
B, C, D, or E. The shapes were a blue square, red circle,
green cross, yellow triangle, and orange diamond (Figure 2),
such that color and shape information were redundant (to
increase distinctiveness and facilitate identification).
Eye tracking data were analyzed to extract predictive gaze
shifts (PGS), defined as directing the point of gaze away
from the frame displaying the shape sequences toward the
reward’s frame 200 ms or less prior to the actual onset of
the reward (inferred to be anticipatory). The 200-ms
criterion was based on the estimated time to program an eye
movement (Gredebäck, Johnson, & von Hofsten, 2010).
Gaze shifts to the reward’s frame that were completed after
200 ms past its onset were not classified as PGS (inferred to
be reactive). For each subject, we computed the difference
between the number of PGS for true trials and for false
trials. We used this PGS difference score as an indicator of
how well the infants learned what sequences predicted the
effect.
We hypothesized that (1) older infants would produce
more PGS for true vs, false trials (higher PGS difference
scores) than younger infants, regardless of condition, due to
development in perceptual processing, attention, and/or
memory, and that (2) infants would produce the highest
PGS difference scores in the C condition, followed by BC,

As noted, a greater number of PGS in true vs. false trials
was taken as evidence for causal structure learning. We first
used a median split to divide the sample into two age
groups, and found that older infants (M = 15.6 months)
produced reliably more positive PGS difference scores
overall than younger infants (M = 11.4 months), M PGS
difference = .65 vs. -.86, respectively, t(61) = 2.29, p = .026.
However, as revealed by within-condition t-tests, older
infants’ performance significantly exceeded chance only in
the C condition, (t(9) = 2.50, p = .034), while it was
marginally significant in BC (t(8) = 1.98, p = .084) and not
significant in ABC (t(14) = -.335, p = .742).
Analysis of correlations between age and PGS difference
confirmed these observations. We found a significant
overall correlation between infants’ age and PGS difference
(r = .28, p = .025). Within each condition (Figure 3), the
correlation between age and PGS difference was statistically
significant for the C condition (r = .48, p = .036), marginally
significant for the BC condition (r = .39, p = .10), and nonsignificant for the ABC condition (r = .16, p = .45).
To examine learning across trials, we computed a series
of generalized estimating equations with PGS difference as
the dependent variable. We found a marginally significant
age x trial type x trial interaction in the ABC condition (p =
.09), but the interactions in BC and C conditions were not
statistically significant (ps = .15 and .77, respectively).
The overall positive correlation between age and PGS
difference supports our first hypothesis that older infants

vs. false trials as a function of condition and age. Points

would outperform younger infants. The within-condition
correlations suggest that development in this period is
strongest for the C condition, followed by BC, which
provides tentative support for our second hypothesis,
implying that infants are better able to make causal
predictions when the number of conditional probabilities
they need to track is relatively low. Performance did not
improve across trials in the BC and C conditions as infants
gained experience in the task. There was some suggestion of
age-related improvement across trials in the ABC condition,
perhaps owing to older infants’ ability to detect multiple
conditional probabilities in this sequence with repeated
exposure.

Bayesian Model
We developed a Bayesian model to simulate the causal
inference in each trial and to predict the occurrence of the
reward (effect). The model incorporates generic priors
favoring simple causes, a constrained causal hypothesis
space (subset of all possible hypotheses) to reflect the
limited working memory of infants, and a noisy function for
correctly identifying and memorizing the shapes in each
sequence to emulate developing perception and memory
systems in infancy.
To enable the inference, the model first defined a
constrained causal space (set of all possible causal structures
to be considered) using all permutations of the five
candidate shapes in each of the three positions, with
allowance for variable shape position(s). For example, the
causal structure in Figure 4a would predict the effect
following a sequence of the blue square in the first position,
red circle in the second, and green cross in the third; the
structure in Figure 4b predicts the effect following the red
circle in the second position and green cross in the third,
regardless of the first shape. This first example would
correspond to an ABC cause in the behavioral paradigm,
and the second a BC cause. Unlike Buchsbaum et al. (2011),
non-terminal subsequences (e.g., ABx) are considered
possible causes.
The hypothesis space, 𝐻, is defined over the causal space,
such that a given hypothesis, ℎ, is drawn from a set of
causes. The current model assumes that all hypotheses
consist of only one cause, reflecting the limited working
memory in infancy.

Figure 4: Two possible hypotheses (a subset of the
constrained hypothesis space), each positing a single cause
of the effect. For each candidate cause, the specified shape
must appear in that position (e.g., a blue square first). The
letter x indicates variable shape positions.

To make a comparison with infants’ behavioral measure
(PGS), the model predicts the probability of a reward given
the current shape sequence and all previous data. The
computation sums over all hypotheses ℎ in the hypothesis
space 𝐻 to compute the probability of the reward (𝑟) given
some current shape sequence (𝑠) and all previous trials’
sequence and reward data (𝐷):
                                    𝑃 𝑟     𝑠, 𝐷) =   

𝑃 𝑟     𝑠, ℎ)𝑃 ℎ     𝐷)   .                          (1)
!∈!

The posterior distribution, 𝑃 ℎ     𝐷), represents the most
current belief about the cause of the reward given all prior
data, and is easily computed from Bayes’ rule:
𝑃 𝐷     ℎ)𝑃(ℎ)
𝑃 ℎ     𝐷) =   
    .
!! 𝑃 𝐷     ℎ′)𝑃(ℎ′)
The prior probability of a hypothesis,  𝑃(ℎ), is based on the
prior distribution defined in Buchsbaum et al. (2011, Eq. 3),
modified as:
1
                      𝑃 ℎ =   𝑃 𝑐 ∈ ℎ =   
    ,          (2)
1 + exp  (−𝛽 𝑐 − 2 )
where |𝑐| is the length of causal sequence 𝑐 in hypothesis ℎ.
In our experiment, this is the number of specified shapes, 1
to 3. In Eq. 2, 𝛽 represents a prior favoring causal sequences
of a certain length. 𝛽 < 0 gives preference to shorter
sequences.
The likelihood of observing the data given a specific
hypothesis, 𝑃 𝐷     ℎ), is computed as the product of the
likelihood probability for all previous trials’ sequences and
the presence or absence of the reward:
    𝑃 𝐷     ℎ) =   

𝑃 𝑟     𝑠, ℎ)  .
!,!∈!

The conditional probability of the reward given a specific
shape sequence and causal hypothesis, 𝑃 𝑟     𝑠, ℎ), also
computed in Eq. 1, is determined by two factors: the
probability of a candidate causal event 𝑐 generating a
reward 𝑟, and the probability of identifying causal event 𝑐
based on the observed shape sequence  𝑠,
                                        𝑃 𝑟     𝑠, ℎ) =   

𝑃 𝑟     𝑐, ℎ)𝑃(𝑐   𝑠   .                              (3)  
!

The two components in Eq. 3 can be conceptualized,
respectively, as the prediction of the reward’s presence or
absence given the constituent causes of the sequence,
𝑃 𝑟     𝑐, ℎ), and the identification of each candidate cause
from the sequence of shapes, 𝑃(𝑐     𝑠 .
The prediction component computes the probability of the
effect following the identified sequence and corresponds to
causal reasoning. In this model, it is assumed that causes
are deterministic, i.e., the reward always occurs if the
candidate causal event in the hypothesis is identified.
The identification component involves a noisy process of
recognizing potential causal cues, resulting from attention,
perception, and memory constraints in infancy. We
introduce probabilistic noise to allow a certain probability of
misidentifying or misremembering cues. This probability
weights the deterministic causal reasoning to yield a
probabilistic likelihood function in Eq. 3. The identification
probability can be calculated using Bayes’ rule as:

1979

𝑃 𝑠     𝑐)𝑃(𝑐)
  .                                                (4)
! ! 𝑃 𝑠     𝑐′)𝑃(𝑐′)
The prior probability of each candidate cause 𝑐 is computed
as in Eq. 2. The likelihood of 𝑠 given 𝑐 is defined using a
multinomial distribution as:
1 − 𝜃 |!|!!
                                                    𝑃 𝑠     𝑐) =    𝜃 !
,                                              (5)

where 𝜃 represents the probability of correctly identifying
and remembering a given shape (“matching probability”)
and m is the number of specified shapes in 𝑐 that match (in
the same position) those in 𝑠. Given that there are five
unique shapes, 𝜃 = 0.2 corresponds to matching at chance.
                                                𝑃 𝑐     𝑠) =

Assessment
Under the assumptions of single-cause hypotheses and
deterministic causes, we evaluated the performance of the
model under different values for model parameters: the
probability that an infant will correctly identify and
remember a given shape (𝜃) in Eq. 5 and the degree of the
preference favoring shorter causal sequence lengths (𝛽) in
Eq. 2. These parameters correspond to constraints on
perception and simplicity preference in causal reasoning,
respectively.
The model predicted the probability of a
reward,  𝑃 𝑟     𝑠, 𝐷), for each trial in each individual infant’s
session. Then we averaged 𝑃 𝑟     𝑠, 𝐷) across all true trials
(i.e., predictive of the reward) and all false trials, separately.
To compute the model prediction analog to the PGS
difference score for infants, we calculated the difference in
expected frequencies of PGS for both true and false trials, to
fit each individual’s data. We then averaged across subjects
within each of the three conditions.
Figure 5 shows the model’s performance as a function of
𝛽, the degree to which simple causes are favored, when
𝜃 = 1 (i.e., perfect shape identification).   When 𝛽 < 0,
favoring simple causes, the model achieves the best
performance in the C condition, followed by BC, then ABC
(the latter two track closely in the range −1 < 𝛽 < 0),
consistent with older infants’ performance as shown in
Figure 3. However, when 𝛽 > 0, indicating a bias favoring
longer shape sequences (as used in Buchsbaum et al., 2011),
the model predicts the opposite pattern, with the ABC
condition yielding the best performance, and the C condition
the worst. Accordingly, we conclude that a negative 𝛽,
favoring simple causes with shorter shape sequences, is
essential to account for the overall main effect of better
performance for infants in the C condition relative to ABC.
We also examined the influence on model performance of
the second model parameter, 𝜃, the probability of correct
shape-matching. We assume that infants are able to identify
shapes better (i.e., adopt higher 𝜃 values) with increasing
age. Figure 6 depicts the model performance as a function of
matching probability when 𝛽 = −1 (preference for shorter
causes). The model exhibits better performance with the
increase of shape matching probability for the C condition,

scores as a function of 𝛽 values: causal sequence length

shorter causal sequences (𝛽 = 0 is uniform). This

perfect shape identification and memory).
consistent with the significant age effect observed for
infants in the C condition. For the BC condition, a smaller
improvement was revealed by the model, in agreement with
the marginal age effect in infant performance. In contrast,
the ABC condition did not show monotonic improvement
over the range of matching probabilities, and also exhibited

performance at or below chance level (i.e., same frequency
of PGS for predictive and non-predictive sequences) for all
values except 𝜃 = 1, when shapes were perfectly
recognized and memorized. Such chance-level performance
in the ABC condition when the shape identification process
is noisy is consistent with the observed performance of the
infants, suggesting the infants’ failure to learn in the ABC
condition may be due to their noisy perception and limited
attention and memory for identifying and remembering the
shapes.

General Discussion
The experiment and model provide an important first step
toward assessing the developmental changes in the second
year of infancy that increase sensitivity to more statistically
complex cause-effect relations. What developmental
mechanisms could be at work? Our experimental results
imply that performance was constrained by statistical
complexity, in particular computation of conditional
probabilities in the BC and ABC causal sequences, and our
modeling results in turn imply that these computations may
be constrained by difficulties identifying individual items
and remembering their ordering in sequence. It remains for
future studies to examine these possibilities, and to pinpoint
the ages at which infants are able to track item identity and
ordering so as to examine their contributions to detecting
multiple conditional probabilities in predicting an effect.
It might be objected that the task we used is solvable by
purely associative properties (i.e., statistical regularity).
However, it is unclear whether standard associative
accounts would be able to explain why performance was
better in the C condition than in the other two conditions,
since the statistical regularity was comparable across all
three conditions. As previous research has shown, statistical
regularity is necessary but not sufficient for causal
inference: the learner must also have an a priori notion of
causes (Cheng, 1997) and prior knowledge to enable
efficient inference of causal relations (Griffiths &
Tenenbaum, 2009; Lu et al., 2008).
The current study provides converging evidence for the
importance of generic causal prior knowledge and highlights
constraints based on attention, perception, and memory in
guiding high-level causal reasoning in infancy. The novel
experimental paradigm goes beyond the limitations of
previous statistical learning and causal perception research,
offering a promising new approach to determine how these
processes develop in infancy. Planned future experiments
using this paradigm, along with corresponding extensions of
the Bayesian model, will contribute to better understanding
of this developmental trajectory.
