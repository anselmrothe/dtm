Structure Derivation Analyses
For these analyses, the full set of average pairwise distances
between the 15 items for each age group were first
submitted to hierarchical cluster analysis, with distance
                                                                       Kindergarten
between clusters calculated using the Average method. This
form of analysis assigns items that are linked by short
distances to local clusters that are in turn embedded within
higher-order clusters of more distantly linked items. The
resultant hierarchical clustering solutions are presented as a
dendrogram for each group in Figure 3. These dendrograms
are composed of nodes (represented by vertical lines), and
arcs linking these nodes (represented by horizontal lines).
The 15 items appear as the external nodes of each
dendrogram. These external nodes are connected by arcs to
form internal nodes that group the 15 items into hierarchical
                                                                       Preschool
clusters. The height of the nodes captures both the similarity
of items within a cluster and the distinctiveness of items in
different clusters. Shorter nodes reflect greater similarity.
  Qualitative assessment of these dendrograms reveals
dramatic changes across age groups. The dendrogram for
adult participants is highly organized at all hierarchical
