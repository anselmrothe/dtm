Word learning: Production In 48 production trials, a ran-
dom target picture was presented in the center of the screen;
the participant was instructed to type the name of the pic-
ture in Colbertian and the participant’s response and RT were
recorded. After making a response, the picture and the partic-
ipant’s answer remained on the screen, and the correct name
of the target was printed below the participant’s response for
1000 ms. This feedback prompted additional learning. After
completing all 48 trials, the participant was shown his or her
accuracy for the block, then a new testing block of recogni-
tion and production began. After the fifth block the experi-
ment concluded.
Data Analysis

each combination of Block and Condition were identified (RT
> M + 2SD) and replaced with M + 2SD (4.2% of trials).
Analyses were repeated on untrimmed RT data and yielded
the same pattern of results. RT analyses were performed on
correct responses only in order to control for accuracy differ-
ences between blocks and conditions. In production blocks
where a subject’s or item’s mean accuracy was zero (Block
one: 8 subjects or 14 items; Block two: 1 subject or 1 item),
RT was multiply imputed using the Amelia II software pack-
age in R (Honaker, King, & Blackwell, 2011).
