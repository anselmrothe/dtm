    Last, the participants were given a recognition task. They
were once again presented with the eight sets of
configurations of geometric figures. This time, however,
they saw not only the bases, but also the distracters for each
set. Each set was presented separately, i.e. the participants
first saw all configurations for the first set, then for the
second, and so on. The order of the sets was the same as in
session one. The participants had to carefully observe each
configuration and then to point the four configurations they
believed they saw in session one, i.e. they had to recognize
which four of the configurations were the bases from the
first session. Their answers were registered in a protocol.
Stimuli Eight sets of 16 configurations of geometric figures
were used for sessions one and three. In each set 4
configurations were the bases and the other 12 were the
distracters. Five independent experts assessed the superficial
