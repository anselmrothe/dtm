the different events occur. This means that, for example, the
common cause structure IV (E ← A → B) is consistent with
the time sequences where A activates first followed by either
B then E (pattern 2), E then B (pattern 4) or E and B at the
same time (pattern 3). Whether this structure is also consis-
tent with A and B occurring at the same time followed by
E (pattern 1), depends on whether or not one assumes that
causes and effects can happen simultaneously. We formalize
two baseline models which differ in terms of whether or not
they rule out the simultaneous activation of causes and effects

B−A−E) resulting in a strong prediction by both the simulta-
neous and the non-simultaneous models that participants will
favor structure I: A → E ← B.2 Finally, participants saw pat-
tern 4 (A − E − B) which is incompatible with the (conjunc-

a dramatic shift to structure VI (A → E) which both models                  c)                              d)

predicted by the simultaneous model as the non-simultaneous
model, for three a different shift was predicted while for the
other nine devices, the simultaneous model predicted no shift.
