Abstract

In this paper we develop a task that measures “memory
multitasking”, the capacity to perform multiple memory
operations. Our aim was to provide a measure targeting
attention-demanding processes, such as resolving proactive
interference and establishing and updating bindings between
stimuli and temporal contexts (Oberauer, 2005). In contrast
to operation-span tasks, however, the task was designed to
minimise the impact of memory-capacity limitations.
Our task is a variant of the dual n-back task (Jaeggi and
colleagues, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2010a), which we called the
“Gatekeeper” task. Gatekeeper is a 2-back task, requiring
participants to make a decision about a pair of stimuli on the
current trial based on their memory about the pair of stimuli
that occurred two trials previously. Hence, it requires only
four items to be held in memory at any time, minimizing the
impact of storage capacity limits (Cowan, 2001; Morey &
Cowan, 2004) that reduce performance in higher-order nback tasks. At the same time, it also avoids easy and fast
familiarity-based strategies available in a 1-back task
(McElree, 2001).
Participants in the Gatekeeper task were told they were in
training to become a doorperson at an exclusive nightclub,
and that their task was to allow in only cool patrons. As
shown in Figure 1, the task stimuli were both visual (an
image of three doors) and auditory (a spoken letter). A
potential patron tries to gain access through one of the three
doors, which is indicated by that door being colored red, and
by saying one of three password letters, “P”, “Y” or “O”.
The small stimulus sets make the Gatekeeper task difficult
because of high levels of proactive interference (Keppel &
Underwood, 1962) caused by the rapidly varying mapping
of the current stimuli to target (i.e., 2-back) and non-target
roles (Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977; Shiffrin & Schneider,
1977). As a consequence – and in contrast to other n-back
tasks (see Gray, Chabris & Braver, 2003) – all trial types in
the Gatekeeper task place a high demands on cognitive
control mechanisms required to resolve proactive
interference.
Participants were told that no potential patron would ever
be so uncool as to use the same door or password as on the
previous trial (i.e., stimuli on the current trial are never the
same as on the previous trial). However, many patrons slip

We developed a novel and game like dual 2-back
computerized task, Gatekeeper, which we deployed online
with 245 male and female participants ranging in age from 13
to 83 years. Gatekeeper requires participants to remember
only 4 items, so does not target memory capacity, but rather
measures multitasking ability and interference control in
working memory. Participants were faster and more accurate
with two-targets than one-target, and Bayesian analysis
supported a null effect of gender on accuracy, but accuracy
did decrease with age. These results are consistent with the
ability to divide attention and control proactive interference
being equal for males and females but showing an age-related
decline.

The Gatekeeper Task
Having to perform more than one task at a time –
multi-tasking – is increasingly common in modern life
(Ophir, Nass, & Wagner, 2009; Wallis, 2006). Multitasking
almost always degrades performance relative to single-task
settings (Wickens, 1980, but see Watson & Strayer, 2010,
for an exception). This has important real world
consequences, such as when talking on a cell phone while
driving (Strayer, & Drews, 2007; Strayer, Drews, &
Johnston, 2003; Strayer, & Johnston, 2001), and is
exacerbated by the fact that the people who are most
capable of multi-tasking are not those who are most likely to
engage in it (Sanbonmatsu, Strayer, Medeiros-Ward &
Watson, 2013).
Multitasking is also an important component of workingmemory measures, such as in complex span tasks, which
require performance on a secondary task during
memorization. For example, in the Operation Span task
(Turner & Engle, 1989; Unsworth, Heitz, Schrock, & Engle,
2005), participants intersperse memorizing items with
deciding whether simple addition equalities are true or false.
The short-term memory and multi-tasking capacities
measured by complex-span tasks can be quite strongly
correlated with fluid intelligence measures (Conway, Kane
& Engle, 2003), particularly when fluid intelligence is
measured under time pressure (Chuderski, 2013).

up by using the door and/or password used two trials back,
and the gatekeeper’s job is to block their access by pressing
a designated key on the keyboard (or allow entry by
pressing a different key). We recorded both the accuracy of
responses and response time (RT). Decision speed was
emphasised by telling participants that only Gatekeepers
who can decide both quickly and accurately make the grade
and will be employed by the nightclub.

required on every trial, we predicted greater reliability for
Gatekeeper than is typically found in n-back tasks.
We also examined how Gatekeeper performance varies as
a function of individual-difference variables commonly
thought to affect multitasking, namely age and gender.
Poorer multitasking performance in older adults has been
attributed to their reduced attentional-control resources, as
indicated, for example, by reduced performance in complex
span tasks (Watson, Lambert, Miller & Strayer, 2011).
Males have also been claimed to be poorer multitaskers than
females (e.g., Mäntylä, 2013), although this claim is
controversial (Mäntylä & Todorov, 2013; Strayer,
Medeiros-Ward, & Watson, 2013).

The Gatekeeper task was made available through a link
associated with the online version of Strayer and Watson
(2012). Strayer and Watson discussed multitasking, and in
particular Watson and Strayer’s (2010) findings about
individual with extraordinary multitasking ability. Readers
of Strayer and Watson were invited to attempt the
Gatekeeper task in order to test their multitasking ability.
The relatively large sample we obtained had good gender
balance and a large range of ages, allowing us to look at the
effects of these factors on performance, while
acknowledging the likely impact of subject-selection effects
(e.g., it is likely that only individuals who thought that they
had good multitasking ability would attempt the task). We
also examined differences among the four within-subject
conditions (no targets, visual target only, auditory target
only and double target). Because each condition occurred
equally often “allow entry” responses were only appropriate
on 25% of trials, so we expected to see a bias against them.
We also expected double-target responses to be faster and
more accurate than single-target responses because of what
is known as “statistical facilitation” (Raab, 1962). Because a
correct response in the double target condition can be based
on either the visual or auditory modality alone, faster
responses can occur because participants can take advantage
of chance fluctuations in speed in either modality.
Facilitation of the double-target condition occurs both if
modalities are processed in parallel or if they are processed
serially, as long as the slowest modality is not always
processed first. Similarly, we would expect higher accuracy
in the double-target condition because a failure to detect a
target in one modality can be compensated for by a correct
detection in the other modality.
We used Bayesian methods implemented in the
BayesFactor package for tests of correlations, t-tests,
ANOVA and ANCOVA on measures of Gatekeeper
performance (Morey & Rouder, 2012; see Rouder, Morey,
Speckman, & Province, 2012, for mathematical details).
This approach has a particular advantage in our context
where evidence for gender differences is controversial, in
that it can provide evidence for a null effect (Wagenmakers,
2007), and so provides an even-handed evaluation of
whether or not males and females differ in multitasking

Figure 1. Example of the first 6 trials in a dual Gatekeeper
block. White letters indicate auditory stimuli (passwords),
and visual targets are the light-grey doors. Visual stimuli
were presented in colour, with light-grey regions in red and
dark regions in black. No response was required for the first
two trials. For each trial thereafter the trial type and correct
response are indicated. For the auditory case the correct
response sequence would be Block-Allow-Block-Allow. For
the visual case the correct response sequence would be
Block-Block-Allow-Allow. Allow responses require neither
the auditory nor the visual stimulus to match 2 trials back.
Responding in Gatekeeper differs from that required in
most dual n-back tasks where separate responses are made
to stimuli in each modality (e.g., Jaeggi et al., 2003, 2007,
2008, 2010a, 2010b). Because only a single response is
made in Gatekeeper, single target trials – where one
stimulus is a target (i.e., it occurred 2-back) and one is not
(i.e., it occurred 3-back) – have added interference due to
the conflicting individual stimulus-to-response associations.
Here we report the results of an experiment examining a
purely dual-task version of Gatekeeper as a measure of
mnemonic multitasking ability. Results from this
experiment were used to investigate the reliability of
performance measures. Previous work (see Jaeggi et al.,
2010b for a summary) suggests that measures from the
single and dual n-back task can suffer from low reliability.
We use a relatively large number of trials and examine the
way reliability changes for smaller subsets of trials.
Traditional n-back tasks with large stimulus sets have
widely varying levels of interference and a response is
required only on target trials. Because proactive interference
is at a high and constant level and because a response is

ability. Given our relatively large samples the Bayesian
approach is also advantageous as it is not subject to the bias
in traditional frequentist approaches towards finding all
effects significant in large samples (Raftery, 1995).

Split-half reliabilities were calculated using the
Spearman-Brown formula for RT based and accuracy based
performance statistics. Table 1 shows split-half reliabilities
of data from n = 400 trials (i.e., all 16 blocks of 25
experimental trials), and subsets (randomly selected from all
experimental trials) of n = 200, 100 and 50 trials.
Reliabilities were averaged over 100 random splits, and with
this number of splits the standard error of the mean was
negligible. Table 1 shows that for most measures reliability
was very good for 400 and 200 trials, and in some cases this
was even the case for lesser numbers.

Method
Participants A total of 245 participants completed the
Gatekeeper task. We analysed the data from 222 participants
who responded on more than 90% of trials and who did not
take extended breaks during the task. Self-report indicated
an age range of 13-83 years with 115 females (mean age of
36.7 years) and 107 males (mean 32 years).

RT. d’ = signal detection sensitivity. Subscripts indicate
statistics calculated based on double-target (av), and

Procedure The task took approximately 30 minutes and
was administered online using Flash Macromedia (URL:
https://psych.newcastle.edu.au/~ae273/GateKeeper/GateKee
per.html). Participants were first asked to record their
gender, age, nationality and occupation. They were then told
that the task involved acting as the door person at a
nightclub and that their task was to block or allow entry to a
person trying to enter the club based on whether they were
‘cool’ or ‘uncool’. As illustrated in Figure 1 at the start of
each trial one of the three doors turned red, and one of the
letters “Y”, “P” or “O” were spoken through the computer
speakers in a female voice.
Auditory and visual stimuli were selected randomly and
independently with the constraint that stimuli never
repeated. Hence, no target, visual target only, auditory target
only and double target trials occurred with equal frequency
on average. Responses were made via the keyboard using
the “z” and “/” to allow or block entry, with the mapping
counterbalanced across participants. Participants were asked
to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. A trial
terminated with the response or after 2.5sec if no response
was given, and a new trial would begin after a 1sec interval.
Participants were told that the initial two entries on each
block of trials were the manager and the barman, who were
allowed entry. Thus, they did not have to respond, but had
to nevertheless remember the doors and passwords used.
Before starting the experiment, participants performed two
12-trial single-task (visual only then auditory only) blocks.
Feedback was provided at the top of the screen indicating
whether responses were correct or incorrect. They then
performed two practice dual-task blocks of 27 trials, the first
with feedback and the second without. Practice was
followed by 16 experimental dual-task blocks of 27 trials
each without feedback. Participants were required to press
the space key to move on to the next block, but could only
do so after a mandatory 1-minute break between blocks had
elapsed. At the conclusion of the task participants were
given feedback about their overall performance.

In ANOVA and ANCOVA analyses we fit all possible
hierarchical models, that is, all additive combinations of
main effects and interactions with the restriction that when
higher-order terms are included so are all of their lowerorder constituents. The restriction corresponds to a Type-II
sums of squares approach in traditional ANOVA. We first
report the best model, that is, the model with the strongest
evidence indicated by the largest Bayes factor (BF) relative
to the intercept-only (grand mean) model.
We then examined the strength of evidence for each term
based on the BF for a simpler model with the term dropped
relative to the best model. For example, BF = 0.1 indicates
the data increase the odds in favour of the inclusion of the
term in the best model by a factor of 10 (i.e., the inverse of
0.1). Jeffreys (1961, p. 432) described a factor of 10 or
larger as indicating strong evidence (i.e., BF ≤ 1/10), whereas
a factor of less than 3 (i.e., BF > 1/3) provides equivocal
evidence (or, more colourfully, evidence “barely worth
mentioning”), with values in between (i.e., 1/10 > BF ≤ 1/3)
indicating substantial evidence.
Figure 2 plots overall accuracy and mean RT for correct
responses as a function of age for male and female
participants. For further analysis we removed 10
participants with overall accuracy less than 55% (triangles
in Figure 2) because they were likely responding randomly
or had misunderstood the response instructions. The
remaining 212 participants had the same age range as the

with accuracy and age having a substantial negative
correlation (r = -0.43). There was substantial evidence
against the addition of a gender main effect (BF = 0.13) and
strong evidence against also adding the interaction (BF =
0.03).
Figure 3 displays the probability of responding “block”
and mean RT results for the 2 × 2 within-subject design
(auditory target present vs. absent × visual target present vs.
absent). Consistent with the predominance of targets, there
was strong evidence for a target bias (c = -0.17, BF = 2.7 ×
109). We used Bayesian t-tests to examine differences in
sensitivity between the single-target and dual-target blocks.
There was substantial evidence for a null difference in
sensitivity between single visual (d’ = 2.23) and auditory (d’
= 2.17) conditions (BF = 0.17), and strong evidence for
greater sensitivity in the dual condition (d’ = 2.95, BF = 8.2
× 1035 and BF = 87.8 × 1048, respectively).

For correct mean RT, the intercept only model (intercept
= 1166ms) was selected, with substantial evidence for a null
gender effect (BF = 0.16) and equivocal evidence for a null
age effect (r = 0.12, BF = 0.69). For accuracy, in contrast,
the age main effect model was selected (BF = 2.1 × 109)

Discussion
Overall, measures derived from the Gatekeeper task were
quite reliable. This was particularly the case for overall
accuracy, which remained highly reliable (> .9) down to 100
trials, and for mean correct RT, which remained highly
reliable even with 50 trials. The results for RT contrast
somewhat with those of Jaeggi et al. (2010b), who found
modest reliability (0.5 – 0.74) based on experiments using

604

40-66 trials in a dual 2-back task. Jaeggi et al. did not
require a non-target response and so could not look at
overall accuracy as we did, but did calculate a highthreshold theory sensitivity measure, hit minus false-alarm
rate. Our reliabilities for sensitivity results are more similar
to, but still somewhat higher than, theirs for similar numbers
of trials (0.55 – 0.63). These results suggest that the
response method and smaller number of stimuli used in the
Gatekeeper task produce more reliable measurements. A
particular advantage of responding to all types of stimuli in
Gatekeeper is that it enables collection of the two most
reliable measures, mean RT and overall accuracy.
As expected, when two targets were present performance
was more accurate and faster than when only one target was
present. There was also a bias towards target responses
(“block”) reflecting the predominance of target stimuli.
Most importantly, neither gender nor age were correlated
with mean RT and there was no indication of a gender
difference in accuracy, but accuracy was negatively
correlated with age, decreasing at a rate of 0.3% per year.
Because of the large number of trials performed by each
participant, and consequently the highly reliable nature of
the accuracy (0.98) and mean RT (0.99) measures, there is
little downward bias in these estimates due to measurement
error that might have spuriously lead to a null effect on the
theoretically controversial issue of gender effects in
multitasking. Further, our Bayesian analysis enabled us to
avoid the inability of traditional approaches to confirm a
null hypothesis and provide positive and substantial
evidence in favour of their being no gender effect.
Taken together, the null effects of gender and the agerelated declines in performance on our novel Gatekeeper
task represent a dissociation that is consistent with a larger
psychological literature on individual differences in
attentional control. More specifically, it is well understood
that there are age-related breakdowns in working memory
capacity and attentional control, the ability to stay on task
and to avoid cognitive distractions, an idea that is nicely
illustrated by the finding of age-related declines in
performance on divided attention tasks (see Watson et al.,
2011, for a review) and the ability to handle interruptions
(Clapp & Gazzaley, 2012). In this light, one might argue
that the older adults who did our Gatekeeper task performed
less accurately than the young adults while multitasking due
to an impaired ability to control and/or divide their
attention, as such attentional abilities are necessary to
resolve interference from distractions and attend to stimuli
from both modalities. It is also possible that there was an
age-related decline in performance on some or all of the
components of the Gatekeeper task rather than in
participant’s ability to perform the components together.
Future work might investigate this possibility by measuring
single 2-back as well as dual 2-back performance.
In contrast, evidence for gender differences in these same
attentional control abilities is more controversial (see
Mäntylä & Todorov, 2013; Strayer, Medeiros-Ward, &
Watson, 2013). Our findings, based on a large sample and

highly reliable measures derived from the Gatekeeper task,
strengthen the case for their being little or no gender
difference in attentional control and multitasking.
More broadly, our results our results are consistent with
individual difference variables that capture underlying
variability in working memory capacity and attentional
control as being useful in explaining individual differences
in multitasking performance (cf., Watson & Strayer, 2010).
The Gatekeeper task provides new and reliable
measurements that particularly target the impact of
attentional control in working memory on multitasking.
However, further work is required to explore the
relationship of multitasking as measured by the Gatekeeper
task and multitasking involving more distinct tasks with
separate goals. Borst, Taatgen and van Rijn (2010) noted
that participants attempt to merge two tasks into a single
task unless they are already practiced and familiar with each
task separately, so it is possible that the performance we
observed on Gatekeeper will differ from multitasking based
on familiar tasks.
