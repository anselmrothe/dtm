                          Introduction
Over the last 50 years there has been a substantial body of
literature describing how contextual information interacts
with memory encoding and recall. More specifically, when
the context changes between encoding and retrieval time,
recall is relatively reduced compared to when retrieval
occurs in the same context as encoding. Beginning with
Godden and Baddeley’s (1975; 1980) seminal work on
context-dependent recall in natural environments (see also
Smith & Vela, 2001), research has shown both internal-state
(e.g., physiological) and external-cue (e.g., environmental)
dependence on recall (Eich, 1980). For instance, Godden
and Baddeley found that when deep sea divers learned a list
underwater, they experienced reduced list recall when                  Figure 1. An overview of ACT-R’s modules and their dependent

language-dependence (Marian & Neisser, 2000), and                      in terms of chunks, which corresponds to the episodic and
motivation-dependence (Delgado, Stenger, & Fiez, 2004).                semantic knowledge that promotes long-term coherence in

      A Buffer Decay Mechanism for ACT-R
The buffer decay module adds a short-term decay to the
activation of chunks recently cleared from buffers. At the
present, chunks still in buffers do not decay, as they are still
in active memory. This short-term decay is used by the
associative learning module and spreading activation to
learn and spread associations whose strength is mediated              Figure 2. Activations based on different base-level decay rates.

   When a chunk remains in a buffer for only 50 ms (i.e., the
length of a single production) then it has a base-level decay
rate greater than .9, which approximates the complete decay
of its residual spreading activation in 2 seconds. This is
coincidentally the time-course of visuospatial and auditory
short-term memory. However, once a chunk has been in a
buffer for longer than 2 to 3 seconds then it is near its
asymptotic decay rate, which reflects the chunk being fully-
consolidated into memory. Thus, the residual spreading
activation from the chunk’s strength of association will
remain maximally influential on later requests.
