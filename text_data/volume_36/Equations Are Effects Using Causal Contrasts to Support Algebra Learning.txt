the critical mathematical concepts essential to the solution
of relevant types of problems. At the heart of our approach
is the use of targeted comparison tasks designed to activate
students’ cause-effect learning at just the points in the
problem-solving process at which critical concepts should
apply. It is not the use of comparison per se that
differentiates our approach, but rather the targeting of
critical concepts by specific comparisons designed to invoke
causal induction. To continue with the same example,
students in our approach are first asked to try solving
