Simulation results
Here we report the preliminary analysis of the model (2–7)
and confront the model with the experimental data. Indeed,
the proposed model still requires the detailed scrutiny, as well
as thorough comparison to the data from human subjects;
these analyses will be reported elsewhere.
   We study numerically the basic properties of the sys-
tem (2–7) by simulating its dynamics using the explicit or-
der 1.5 stochastic Runge-Kutta method (Roessler, 2005). The
values of system parameters used in simulations are: τθ =
3, l = 1, γ = 1, σ = 1, τξ = 0.05, ε = 0.7, θth = 0.2.
   The phase trajectory of system (2–7) shows that both the
described mechanisms are actually captured by the model
                                                                     Figure 8: Cart velocity generated by model (2–7). Values of

This point is highlighted by the cart velocity dynamics: the
initially generated corrective movement is not corrected once
started (Fig. 8).
   The simulated phase trajectory of system (2–7) represented
in Fig. 7 resembles the experimentally obtained phase trajec-
tories (Fig. 4). Naturally, many features of the experimental
data are not captured by the model. For instance, the model
always overshoots the goal position by design, while human
subjects often undershoot substantially (Fig. 4). At the same
time, this and other mismatches between the experimental
and simulted trajectories are apparently of minor importance,
as demonstrated by the analysis of the statistical distributions
(Fig. 9).
