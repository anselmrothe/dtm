assigned a task to perform after learning: they had to choose
the button with either the highest (MAX condition) or
lowest average (MIN condition), or else simply report the
mean for each button (Expected Outcome, or EO condition).
  If people are frugal learners, then they should learn just
the information necessary for their task and so learn more
about task-relevant contrasts than task-irrelevant ones. For
instance, the critical decision in MAX is which button has
the highest mean. Participants can easily rule out the two
low-mean buttons (since their numbers are much lower than
the other two), and so focus on deciding between the two
high-mean buttons. They should thus be more likely to learn                         Figure 1: Example learning trial
