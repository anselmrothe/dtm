Participants
Our sample consisted of 273 middle and high school
students taking pre-algebra, algebra, and geometry courses
that use the CT regularly (i.e., two class periods per week)
at a suburban high school in western Pennsylvania. The
student population was primarily Caucasian (97%) and
included an approximately balanced gender ratio.
Cognitive Tutor (CT)
CT is an ITS for mathematics with hundreds of thousands of
middle and high school users throughout the United States.
The CT provides adaptive tutoring by tracking mastery of
individual knowledge components (KCs) or skills as
learners progress through mathematics content, using a
probabilistic framework called Bayesian Knowledge
Tracing (Corbett & Anderson 1995).                 Mastery is
operationalized as a learner reaching an assessed 0.95
probability of KC knowledge.
  At a higher level, each mathematics sub-discipline (e.g.,
algebra) is divided into units, and units are divided into

and our available background knowledge (Spirtes, et al.,
2000; Pearl 2009). Qualitative causal structure of a linear
structural equation model can be represented by a directed
acyclic1 graph (DAG); under the causal interpretation of a
DAG, directed edges represent direct causal links relative to
the set of variables or features in the DAG.
   Assuming multivariate normal distributions and linear
causal dependencies, asymptotically reliable search
procedures (Spirtes, et al., 2000) are available to infer the
equivalence class of DAGs consistent with observed
(conditional) independence relationships and available
background knowledge (e.g., time-ordering). The
equivalence class, called a pattern (Spirtes, et al., 2000),
provides the set of DAGs that are observationally
indistinguishable (i.e., that entail the same set of
(conditional) independence constraints).
