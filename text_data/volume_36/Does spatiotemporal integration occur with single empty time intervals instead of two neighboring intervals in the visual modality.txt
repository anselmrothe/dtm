consisting of five blocks. In each block, the eight patterns (4
locations × 2 durations) were presented four times each in a
random order.
   The categorization method (or the signal-detection-theory
approach) as used in Grondin (1998) was adopted.
Participants were instructed to respond “short” when an
inter-stimulus interval delimited by two flashes was briefer
than 250 ms (i.e., 220 ms) and to respond “long” when the
interval was longer than 250 ms (280 ms). After the
response, a feedback message indicating whether the
response was correct or incorrect was presented at the center
of the display during 1.2 s. The next trial started 1 s after the
termination of the feedback.
   Participants responded by pressing a button of a computer
mouse. In one sub-session, participants pressed the left and
the right buttons for responding “short” and “long,”
respectively. In the other sub-session, they pressed on the
right and the left buttons for responding “short” and “long,”
respectively. The order of these sub-sessions was
counterbalanced.
   Participants were instructed to respond as correctly as
possible, but for the first few trials of the first block, they
were allowed to choose “short” or “long” randomly because
they did not know how long the around-250-ms interval
would be perceived as. Thus, the first block of each sub-
session was regarded as training and removed from the data
analysis. Participants were instructed not to adjust their
perceived duration according to spatial distance between
presented stimuli. They were also instructed not to count the
cadence or make sounds synchronized with flashes (e.g.,
hand tapping and internal voicing) for discrimination. Hand
tapping and internal voicing might reduce the spatial effects
because sounds were made at a constant location.
   A break of a few seconds was taken between the blocks.
