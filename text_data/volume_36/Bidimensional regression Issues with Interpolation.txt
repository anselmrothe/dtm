bidimensional regression models were significantly higher
with 10 coordinate pairs (M = 0.18; SD = 0.13) than with 40
coordinate pairs (M = 0.15; SD = 0.08), F(1,792) = 24.70,
MSE = 0.007, p < .0001. In this case, additional parameters
did not result in a better fit. Both linear contrasts were also

   A similar pattern of results emerged from the
interpolation of data points from a real world study. Welch’s
t-tests found that the interpolation of one coordinate pair did
not significantly inflate the R2 value, t(89.82) = 0.33, SE =
0.035, p = .74; the interpolation of two coordinate pairs did
significantly inflate the R2 value, t(88.62) = 3.34, SE =
0.035, p < .001; and the interpolation of three coordinate
pairs also significantly inflated the R2 value, t(87.02) = 4.59,
SE = 0.037, p < .0001.                                               Figure 3: Histograms representing the distributions of
