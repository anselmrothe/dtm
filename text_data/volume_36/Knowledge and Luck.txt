Abstract
Nearly all success is due to some mix of ability and luck. But
some successes we attribute to the agent’s ability, whereas
others we attribute to luck. To better understand the criteria
distinguishing credit from luck, we conducted a series of
studies on knowledge attributions. Knowledge is an
achievement that involves reaching the truth. But many
factors affecting the truth are beyond our control and reaching
the truth is often partly due to luck. Which sorts of luck are
compatible with knowledge? We find that knowledge
attributions are highly sensitive to lucky events that change
the explanation for why a belief is true. By contrast,
knowledge attributions are surprisingly insensitive to lucky
events that threaten but ultimately fail to change the
explanation for why a belief is true. These results shed light
on our concept of knowledge, help explain apparent
inconsistencies in prior work on knowledge attributions, and
constitute progress toward a general understanding of the
relation between success and luck.
Keywords: luck; success; evaluation; knowledge attribution

Introduction
Reasoning about what people know is central to our lives
and is often essential for predicting and evaluating human
action. Whether someone knows that a certain action is
impermissible affects whether we excuse or punish them for
it (Hart, 1959; Duff, 1990; Malle & Nelson, 2003).
Moreover, if you know something, then you’re entitled to
base actions on it and communicate it to others. By contrast,
if you don’t know something, then it seems that you should
be more cautious about basing actions on it or
communicating it to others (Unger, 1975; Williamson,
2000; Hawthorne, 2004; Stanley, 2005; Fantl & McGrath,
2009; Turri, 2011a; Turri, 2013a; Buckwalter & Turri, under
review). Indeed, researchers have recently argued that
knowledge sets the standard for the two main forms of
human pedagogy, assertion (telling someone a fact) and
instructional demonstration (showing someone how
something is done), which makes knowledge an essential
ingredient of human culture and civilization (Buckwalter &
Turri, in press).
Knowledge is an achievement that involves reaching the
truth through cognitive ability (Aristotle, 350 BCE; Reid,

1785; Sosa, 2007; Greco, 2010). Nearly all human
achievement, including knowledge, is due to some mix of
ability and luck. Ludwig Wittgenstein had in mind this
inevitable role of luck when he wrote, “It is always by
favour of Nature that one knows something” (1975: §505).
But not just any sort of luck is compatible with knowing
(Plato, 380 BCE; Russell, 1948, p. 113). For example,
blindly guessing the truth won’t yield knowledge. But
beyond this obvious starting point, which sorts of luck are
viewed as compatible with knowledge?
Insightful work in philosophy and psychology has focused
on one or another aspect of the relationship between
knowledge and luck (Gettier, 1963; Unger, 1968; Harman,
1973; Goldman, 1976; Engel, 1992; Weinberg, Nichols, &
Stich, 2001; Pritchard, 2005; Cullen, 2010; Wright, 2010;
Beebe & Shea, 2013; Buckwalter, 2013; Starmans &
Friedman, 2012; Nagel, San Juan, & Mar, 2013; Starmans
& Friedman 2013), but the relationship has not been
systematically investigated from a psychological
perspective. Other psychological work has investigated how
a neighboring concept related to luck, “deviant causation”
(Searle, 1983), affects people’s attributions of intentional
action and judgments of moral responsibility (Malle &
Knobe, 1997; Pizarro et al., 2003; Knobe, 2003; Malle,
2006; Mele & Cushman, 2007). Recent work has also
identified at least one form of luck, broadly related to
deviant causation, that doesn’t seem to diminish knowledge
attribution (Starmans & Friedman, 2012), although
subsequent work has claimed to undermine these findings
(Nagel, San Juan, & Mar, 2013).
Philosophers and psychologists have developed many
thought experiments intended to pump intuitions about the
relationship between knowledge and luck (e.g. Shope, 1983;
Beebe & Buckwalter, 2010; Wright, 2010; Starmans &
Friedman, 2012; Turri, in press). These thought experiments
vary widely and focus on different features that different
authors have considered relevant to luck. Unfortunately,
contributors to the debate have failed to exercise appropriate
control over the thought experiments. The variety of cases
exhibits three important structural differences. First, many
differ in whether the agent initially perceives a state of
affairs that makes his or her belief true (a “truth-maker,” for

1958

short). In some examples, the agent perceives a truth-maker,
but in others the agent perceives a convincing fake. Second,
many examples differ in whether the agent’s perceptual
relation remains intact throughout. Sometimes the agent
perceives a certain truth-maker and events threaten to
disrupt that truth-maker, but the threat ultimately fails.
Other times, the threat succeeds in disrupting the original
truth-maker, which is then replaced by a “backup”
truthmaker. Third, many examples differ in how closely the
originally perceived truth-maker and backup truth-maker
resemble one another. Sometimes they very closely
resemble one another, while other times they differ greatly.
Theorists have argued at length over the intuitively correct
verdict in each of these cases — does the agent know or only
believe the truth? — and the best explanation for that verdict
(for an overview, see Shope, 2002). We will not enter into
the theoretical debate here, at least not directly (see the
General Discussion for ways that our results could indirectly
shed light on the theoretical debate). Instead, we are
interested in whether people’s ordinary judgments about
knowledge are sensitive to the three luck-related factors
identified in the previous paragraph: threat, disruption, and
replacement.
More specifically, we will test the effect of the following
things on ordinary knowledge attributions: (i) A threat to the
detection of truth: When an agent perceptually detects a
truth-maker, what is the effect of a salient threat to her
ability to detect it? (ii) The disruption of a truth-maker:
What is the effect of a successful threat that fundamentally
changes the explanation for why her belief is true? (iii) The
resemblance between the initial truth-maker and the backup
truth-maker that replaces it: What is the effect of making
them very similar or dissimilar?
The results of our investigations will highlight some
general lessons about the ordinary concept of knowledge
and provide a framework for integrating prior psychological
findings on knowledge attributions and resolving some
potentially troubling inconsistencies in the literature.
Ultimately it turns out that there is no true and general
lesson to be drawn about the relationship between
knowledge and luck. Instead, there are several more specific
lessons about the relationship between knowledge and
different luck-related factors, each of which affect
knowledge attributions in interesting and importantly
different ways. Our results will also shed light on the
potential theoretical usefulness of a peculiar class of cases,
known as “Gettier cases,” that have recently generated
controversy in the psychological literature (Starmans &
Friedman, 2012; Turri, 2013b; Nagel, San Juan, & Mar,
2013; Nagel, Mar, & San Juan 2013; Starmans & Friedman,
2013). The General Discussion examines in greater detail
the relationship between our findings and prior work on
these issues.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants. Eight hundred and thirteen new participants
were tested (aged 18–75 years, mean age = 31.25, 326
female, 96% reporting English as a native language). We
excluded data from 85 participants who failed
comprehension questions. Including data from these
participants did not affect the results reported below.
Materials and Procedure. Participants were randomly
assigned to one of seven conditions and read a single story.
(See Table 1.) Each condition featured a different story. The
basic storyline featured an agent, Emma, admiring jewelry
in a fancy department store (based on a story in Nagel, San
Juan, & Mar, 2013). Emma purchases a stone from the
diamond display, puts it in her pocket, browses for another
minute, then leaves the store. The different versions of the
story vary whether the stone is a real diamond or a fake,
whether there is a threat to the stone remaining in Emma’s
pocket, whether the threat fails or succeeds, and whether
any other stone also ends up in Emma’s pocket. The
different stories manipulated whether the Emma detects an
initial truth-maker, whether Emma’s truth-detection is
saliently threatened, whether the threat succeeds in
disrupting the initial truth-maker, and whether the backup
truth-maker is highly similar or dissimilar to the initial.
In all the stories, Emma purchases a stone from a jewelry
store, puts it in her pocket, and soon walks out of the store.
In all the stories that involve detection, the stone she
purchases is a diamond. In all the stories that do not involve
detection, the stone is a fake. In all the stories that involve
similar backup truth-makers, the backup truth-maker is that,
one way or another, a diamond is put into Emma’s pocket
before she leaves the store. In all the stories that involve
dissimilar backup truth-makers, the backup truth-maker is
that a real diamond was secretly sewn into Emma’s pocket
by a previous owner long ago.
After reading the story, participants answered a series of
comprehension questions about whether Emma has a
diamond in her pocket when leaving the store, whether it’s
reasonable for Emma to think that there is a diamond in her
pocket, and why Emma thinks that there is a diamond in her
pocket. All participants then answered the same test
question about whether, as Emma leaves the store, she
knows that there is a diamond in her pocket. Questions were
always asked in the same order and response options rotated
randomly.

Results and Discussion
Gender did not affect attribution rates (Male, 54%; Female,
53%), Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.886, n.s., so the analyses
that follow collapse across gender.
Assignment to condition affected rates of knowledge
attribution: 12–90%, χ2 (df = 6, N = 813) = 242.21, p <
0.001, Cramer’s V = 0.546 (Figure 1). Rates of knowledge
attribution did not differ between Knowledge Control (90%)

and Failed Threat (83%), Fisher’s, p = .113, n.s., and far
exceeded chance rates in both conditions, binomial tests, ps
< 0.001. A failed threat to truth-detection does not
significantly depress knowledge attribution and is viewed as
fully consistent with knowledge. Knowledge attribution in
Detect Similar (55%) was significantly lower than in
Knowledge Control, Fisher’s, p < .001, Cramer’s V = .367,
non-significantly above chance, binomial, p = .195, and
significantly higher than in Ignorance Control, Fisher’s, p <
.001, Cramer’s V = .416. Rates of knowledge attribution
differed significantly depending on whether the replacement
truth-maker was similar or dissimilar to the initial truthmaker. This was true regardless of whether the agent had
initially detected a truth-maker: rates of knowledge
attribution were higher in Detect Similar than in Detect

We replicated each of the results reported in Experiment 1
with separate additional studies. The results not only
replicate earlier findings but also demonstrate that the
findings generalize to other contexts and are not due to the
use of a particular type of story. Experiment 1 featured
stories set in indoor social contexts involving owned
artifacts and other human agents with malicious intentions
(e.g. whether a shopper knows she has a diamond). By
contrast, Experiments 2-4 feature stories set in outdoor
contexts involving natural kinds (e.g. whether an ecologist
knows she saw a species of ground squirrel).
Experiment 2 (N=135, aged 18-59 years, mean age = 29.1
years, 41 female) replicates the effect on knowledge
attributions of a salient but failed threat to the truth of a
perceptual judgment (see Table 2). For example, and to give
a sense of the materials in Experiments 2-4, the following
vignette was used to further test the effect of failed threats
on knowledge attribution:

1960

Darrel is an ecologist collecting data on red speckled
squirrels in Canyon Falls national park. The park is
divided into ten zones and today Darrel is working in
Zone 3. While scanning the river valley with his
binoculars, Darrel sees a small, bushy-tailed creature
with distinctive red markings on its chest and belly.
The red speckled ground squirrel is the only native

species with such markings. Darrel records in his
journal, "At least one red speckled ground squirrel in
Zone 3 today." Ecologists are unaware that a nonnative species of prairie dog recently began invading
the park. These prairie dogs also have red markings on
their chest and belly. When these prairie dogs tried to
invade Zone 3, the red speckled ground squirrels were
unable to completely drive them away. Still, the
animal Darrel is looking at is indeed a red speckled
ground squirrel.
We again found that when a threat failed to prevent an agent
from detecting the truth, participants attributed knowledge
at rates exceeding chance, p < .001, test proportion = .5, in
this case that “Darrel knows that there is at least one red
speckled ground squirrel in Zone 3 today.” Indeed these
rates were not significantly different from a case where no
such threat was mentioned, Fisher’s p = .164, n.s.. By
contrast, participants overwhelmingly declined to attribute
knowledge, p < .001, when a threat succeeded in preventing
an agent from detecting the truth, for instance when the
animal Darrel was looking at above was indeed one of the
prairie dogs. Again the luck involved in such a threat failing
is viewed as fully consistent with knowledge.

Experiment 3 (N=141, aged 18-66 years, mean age = 31.2
years, 57 female) replicates the effect on knowledge
attributions of an unnoticed change in the explanation for
why the agent’s belief is true (See Table 3). The results
support the claim that an unnoticed replacement-by-backup
does affect whether it is viewed as knowledge, χ2 (df = 2) =
40.16, p < .001, Cramer’s V = .534. When replacement does
not occur, knowledge attribution is at ceiling but when it
does occur, knowledge attribution is significantly lower,
Fisher’s, p = .017, Cramer’s V = .254. Nevertheless, such a
replacement is widely viewed as consistent with knowing:
most participants in Replacement attributed knowledge even
though the belief was ultimately true because of the backup
truth-maker, p = .033, test proportion = .5. However,
participants’ willingness to attribute knowledge when
replacement occurred seemed to depend crucially on
whether the initial truth-maker was detected, as
demonstrated by the very low rates of knowledge attribution
in No Detection, significantly below chance, p < .001.

Normal
Detection
88%

Experiment 4 (N=149, aged 19-63 years, mean age = 30
years, 42 female) replicates the effect of similarity or
dissimilarity of the initial and replacement truth-makers on
knowledge attributions. The results continue to support the
view that when disruption and replacement occurs,
knowledge attribution is affected by how similar or
dissimilar the replacement truth-maker is to the original, χ2
(df = 2) = 25.73, p < .001, Cramer’s V = .416. People were
more likely to attribute knowledge when the replacement
was highly similar to the original than when it was
dissimilar, Fisher’s, p = .014, one-tailed, Cramer’s V = .267,
and when the replacement was dissimilar than when there
was no detection at all, Fisher’s, p = .012, Cramer’s V =
.260. As expected, No Detection was overwhelmingly
viewed as a case of ignorance, with rates of knowledge
attribution falling far below chance, binomial, p < .001, test
proportion = .5. Knowledge attribution was also below
chance in Dissimilar, binomial, p = .009. Knowledge
attribution in Similar differed neither from chance,
binomial, p = .392, nor from the rate of knowledge
attribution in Replacement from Experiment 3, binomial, p
= .248, test proportion = .66.

No

23%

Similar

Though comparing results across these experiments is
fraught, we still note the impressive consistency of
knowledge attribution in structurally analogous conditions
in Experiment 1 and replications of Experiments 2-4. All
knowledge controls consistently resulted in approximately
80-90% knowledge attribution. Conditions involving failed
threats were consistently treated similarly to clear cases of
knowledge. Cases serving as ignorance controls consistently
resulted in approximately 10-15% knowledge attribution.
Cases of luck involving similar replacement consistently
resulted in approximately 50-60% knowledge attribution.
The similarities among these findings suggest that the
ordinary concept of knowledge is deeply sensitive to the
structural features of cases that we have identified.

General Discussion
Like any human achievement, knowledge is usually due to a
mix of ability and luck. But the effect of luck on knowledge
attributions is not well understood. We tested the effect of
three luck-related factors on knowledge attribution —
threat, disruption, and replacement — and found that the
relation is complex and often surprising. We suggest that
our investigation is profitably viewed as a case study in how

1961

people judge the relationship between success and luck. We
focused on a centrally important class of cognitive
evaluations, knowledge judgments, which in everyday life
are often implicated in further important questions about
how people will behave, how they ought to behave, the
extent to which we credit or blame them for outcomes, and
whether we excuse or punish them for transgressions.
We made three main findings. First, we found that
knowledge attributions are insensitive to the luck of a salient
threat that fails to prevent someone from perceptually
detecting the truth. Second, we found that knowledge
attributions are sensitive to the luck involved with an
unnoticed disruption and change in the explanation for why
a belief is true. Third, we found that when the explanation
changes for why a belief is true, knowledge attributions are
sensitive to the way in which the truth is replaced or
restored. People are more inclined to attribute knowledge
when the “backup” or replacement truth-maker is similar to
the original truth-maker than when it is dissimilar. Although
we have treated the similarity/dissimilarity distinction as a
dichotomy in these initial attempts to test its effect, we
acknowledge that it is probably better thought of as a
continuum. Further work is needed to understand how
subtler changes in similarity affect knowledge attributions.
There has been recent controversy in psychology and
philosophy over whether laypeople attribute lucky
knowledge to agents in an intriguing range of cases known
as “Gettier cases” (Gettier 1963; see Turri 2012 for a
review). Studying Gettier cases is theoretically useful
because they provide an excellent “opportunity to test which
factors affect knowledge attributions” (Starmans &
Friedman, 2013, p. 2). Some researchers have found that
laypeople do tend to attribute knowledge in some Gettier
cases (Starmans & Friedman, 2012), some researchers claim
that laypeople do not (Nagel, San Juan, & Mar, 2013), and
others observed mixed results depending on the method of
questioning (Turri, 2013b). Our findings suggest an
explanation for the seemingly inconsistent prior findings
and theorizing on Gettier cases: knowledge attributions are
sensitive to different forms and combinations of luck and
prior research on Gettier cases has not controlled for all the
sensitivities identified here. Indeed, by some criteria (e.g.,
Zagzebski, 1996; Lewis, 1996; Pritchard 2005), researchers
would count the stories used for five separate conditions in
Experiment 1 as Gettier cases: Failed Threat, Detect
Similar, Detect Dissimilar, No Detect Similar, and No
Detect Dissimilar. But if intuitions about Gettier cases vary
as widely as our results indicate — from patterns that
closely resemble responses to paradigmatic knowledge
(Failed Threat) to patterns that closely resemble responses
to paradigmatic ignorance (No Detect Dissimilar) — then
“Gettier case” is a theoretically useless category. The fact
that something is a Gettier case would be consistent with its
being both overwhelmingly judged knowledge and
overwhelmingly judged ignorance, thereby masking
differences that radically affect the psychology of

knowledge attributions and depriving the category of any
diagnostic or predictive value.
An important question for further research is why
knowledge attributions are selectively sensitive to some but
not other forms of luck. Answering this question might also
help shed light on the social function of knowledge
attributions as well as neighboring domains such as moral
evaluation. Ethicists and moral psychologists have asked
similar questions about the role of luck in evaluating an
agent’s moral status (Williams & Nagel 1976; Young et al.
2010). But whatever the ultimate explanation for this
particular pattern of selective sensitivity, one thing is
certain. We are fallible social beings deeply interested in
keeping track of what people deserve and are responsible
for. Whether it’s a question of knowledge or morality or
athletics, we seek criteria to distinguish genuine
achievements from lucky outcomes. Our results have helped
to expose some of those criteria.
