                          Method
Participants
Fifty-six English-speaking 3-year-olds (22 boys and 34
girls) with a mean age of 35.9 months (range = 30.3 to 42.3
months) were tested. All were recruited from Berkeley,
California, and its surrounding communities. An additional
6 children were tested but excluded due to refusal to make a
choice at test (N = 2), parental interference (N = 3), no
attempt to make any activations (N = 1) and experimenter
error (N = 1). Each child was randomly assigned to a
Training condition or a Free Play condition.
Materials
Four categories of toy machines were used in this
experiment, with two identical machines in each category.
The categories differed in shape and color, i.e. machines in
Category 1 were blue and rectangular; machines in Category
2 were red and triangular; machines in Category 3 were
green and circular; and machines in Category 4 were orange
and L-shaped (each approximately 30 cm x 10 cm x 5 cm).
Each set of machines also produced a unique effect when
activated, e.g. made a sound, lit up with flashing lights, or
played a song.
   A variety of small blocks (approximate 4 cm x 2 cm x 1
cm) with different shapes and colors were used to activate
these machines. Some of these blocks matched the toy
machines in shape but not color (shape-match blocks), some
matched the machines in color but not shape (color-match             Figure 1: Schematic diagram of materials and procedure.
