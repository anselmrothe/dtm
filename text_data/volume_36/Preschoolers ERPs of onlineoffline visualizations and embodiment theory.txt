   We explored the relationships between a perceptual-attention          children. Here, we define “online simulation” as the
   task and a word-verification task using event-related potential       dynamic processes of early automatic sensorimotor system

   between online (visual attention) and offline (mental imagery)        we define “offline simulation” as the classic notion of
   simulation in the two tasks to test key aspects of abstract           mental imagery, that is, effortful, voluntary, goal-based late
   word acquisition. Online visualization of all word types,             activation of larger systems including sensorimotor areas –
