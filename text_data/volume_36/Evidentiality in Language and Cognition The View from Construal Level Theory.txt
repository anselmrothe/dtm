was in a non-evidential (indicative) form. In Version 2
grammatical markers were reversed, so that “Milan won
against Real Madrid” was in the evidential form.
   All answers were marked on a 6-point scale, where the
poles contrasted competing interpretations. In the
hypothetical distance scenario, 1 was “For sure Real Madrid
is the winner” and 6 was “For sure Milan is the winner”.
Notice that if an answer is due to cultural knowledge or
norms, then one of the poles will be consistently chosen
over the other, regardless of the version. For example, if
more people think that Milan is a better team than Real
Madrid, Milan would be consistently chosen as a winner
with high degree of certainty in both versions. If answers are
random or due to non-consensual subjective knowledge,
then the means will not be statistically different from chance
in both versions. If, on the other hand, the judgments are
driven by evidentiality, then the answers between the two
versions will differ.
