Figure 3: Depiction of the divergence between models after three observations have been made (two HITs on the red shape, one HIT on the
blue shape). The locations in the grid, {A, B, C, D}, differ in their value according to each model, which is assessed here using the rank of
each observation (with a rank of 1 indicating the observation that is preferred the most). For example, location A has a high probability of
belonging to the red target (see “Label prediction” plot) and a low probability of interference (see “Probability of interference”). As a result,
all of the uncertainty-based models (LE, LEdet , and IG) assign it a relatively low ranking, while the positive testing models assign it a high
ranking. Notably, because of the low chance of interference, this location is ranked slightly higher by PT (which values receiving positive
feedback during sampling) than PTdet (which is indifferent to the probability of interference). The remaining locations show how the model
rankings change with the uncertainty in the outcome of the observation and the possibility of interference. Location B is highly likely to
produce interference, and is ranked highest by LE, whereas location C has a lower probability of interference and is ranked highest by LEdet .
Location D has a low chance of interference but still high uncertainty about its label, and is ranked highest by IG.
