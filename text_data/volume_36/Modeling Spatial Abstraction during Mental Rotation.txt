Methodology
Stimuli The simulation used nine comparators for each base
shape: an identical shape, four high-similarity distractors,
and four low-similarity distractors. While the original
experiment included more distractors, these were the only
surviving stimuli.
    Each comparator was oriented at an angle 120° from the
base shape. Because all rotations are mathematically
equivalent for the model, it was not necessary to try each of
the different rotation angles used in the experiment. In the
previous simulation (Lovett & Forbus, 2013), the rotation
angle was automatically computed from an arrow similar to                         Figure 2: Part-based segmentation.
