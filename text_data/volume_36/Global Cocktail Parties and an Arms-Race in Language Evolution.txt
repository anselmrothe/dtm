Abstract
Many species change their signals in response to crowding,
consistent with information theoretic accounts of signalling in
the presence of noise. In this article we explore the hypothesis
that the statistical structure of language has evolved to enhance
reception and processing in response to competition in the language market. In particular, we investigate how concreteness
has changed over the last 200 years. We take a big data approach, combining large text corpora (including the Google
Ngram corpus, the Corpus of Historical American English, and
presidential speeches) with the recent collection of concreteness norms for over 40,000 English words (Brysbaert et al.,
2013). Across corpora we find that concreteness has steadily
increased since the 1800s. This takes place both within and
across word classes, indicating that the rise in concreteness is
systemic and not limited to changes in grammar. By comparing recent concreteness norms with older norms, we show that
the observed changes in concreteness are not due to a bleaching effect caused by the loss of concreteness as words age. We
further investigate how the statistical distribution of other properties of words change in a way that may indicate that language
is becoming more distinctive. We discuss a number of potential explanations and implications of these changes, including
changes in literacy, gender, the Flynn effect, and the influence
of competition in the marketplace of ideas.

Introduction
Recent trends in communication indicate massive increases in
the amount of information we must process on a daily basis.
Borrowing from the idea of an attention economy, this leads
to potential crowding in a language market. This is likely
to lead to competition among message producers. Similar
to a global cocktail party problem, crowding and the resultant attention economies of information markets mimic the
inclusion of noise in information theoretic accounts of signal
transduction. In such accounts, signals should adapt to noise
in systematic ways to insure information transfer.
If language adapts to the needs of its users, language should
change in response to information crowding. Indeed, numerous other species, for example birds, adapt their communication in response to crowding in ways that facilitate processing
and distinctiveness. How should human languages evolve in
response to competition in a language market? One approach
is to evolve messages that are processed more rapidly, more
easily comprehended, and better recalled. These properties
of language have been well studied by psycholinguists and,
indeed, one specific aspect of language is well marked by its
ability to enhance these processing capacities. That is, concreteness.
Concreteness from a psycholinguistic perspective refers to
the capacity for a concept to be perceived through direct ex-

perience. Among psycholinguistic variables, the relationship between concreteness and cognitive processing is easily
among the most profound. Concrete words are more rapidly
perceived in lexical decision tasks and more easily recalled
in memory tasks. Much of this research follows on Paivio’s
dual-coding theory, which proposed that the combination of
visual and verbal contributions to linguistic information enhance processing. Other theories have since been proposed to
account for the cognitive utility of concreteness, all of which
speak to different aspects of the processing advantage of concrete words. Beyond psycholinguistic tasks, concrete language has been shown to be both more interesting and easier
to understand.
Other theories do not make this prediction. For example,
Dunbar’s theory of language as social grooming would suggest no change in relation to message quality. Knowledgebased theories of the Flynn effect might also be interpreted
to suggest that language is becoming more abstract as humans increase their capacity for symbolic processing and abstract thinking associated with increased scores on intelligence tests.
We investigated these questions using the Google Ngram
(1-gram) corpus of American English, which provides a collection of over 355 billion words since the 1800s as published in books. We also performed the analyses on a text
corpus collected independently of the Google Ngram corpus,
the Corpus of Historical American English, collected to represent a balanced and representative corpus of American English containing more than 400 million words of text from, for
example, newspapers and magazines, from 1810 to 1990. We
further supplemented these corpora with corpora representing the Inaugural Addresses given by U.S. presidents, starting
with George Washington in 1789, and the State of the Union
addresses, starting with Harry Truman in 1945.
Using the Brysbaert norms, we calculated a concreteness
index, Cy , for each year, y, in each of our corpora as follows,
n

Cy = ∑ ci pi,y
i

where ci is the concreteness for word i as found in the Brysbaert et al. concreteness norms and pi is the proportion of
word tokens represented by word i in year y. This was computed for all n words in the concreteness norms and separately
for each year in the corpora.
All the corpora we examined showed an increase in concreteness over time. The Google Ngrams show this rise over
the last 200 years, with a temporary drop following the second world war (Figure 1). The Corpus of Historical American

We further investigated the statistical structure of word collocations and the relative distributions of word usage (Zipf
distributions) over successive years. Our results support the
notion that language is evolving–in our lifetimes–to compensate for increased crowding in the information marketplace.

English shows a similar rise with a slightly less dramatic fall
in the 1950s (relative to the overall increase). On the same
figure we also show the Google Ngram data restricted either
to the words in the lexicon at year 1800 or using only those
words in the concreteness norms that were known by more
than 95% of participants. In both cases, the rise in concreteness remains indicating that the rise is not due to new words
entering the lexicon or unfamiliar words leaving the lexicon.
We find a similar rise in concreteness for Presidential Inaugural Addresses (e.g., Figure 2) and State of the Union Addresses (not shown). Further, we observe that changes in concreteness are due not only to changes in the statistical distribution of word classes (e.g., dropping articles), but also occur
within word classes (e.g., nouns, verbs, and prepositions).

One explanation for the observed rise in concreteness is
that some words may tend to lose concreteness over time.
This has been referred to as semantic bleaching, similar to
grammaticalization. An example is the word disaster, which
originally referred to dire and acute events, but can now usefully refer to everything from one’s hair to public policy. If
bleaching were systematic, it would explain the observed rise
in concreteness. The words that were more often used in the
past may have been more concrete in the past, but due to
bleaching now appear more abstract. Figure 3 shows a comparison of the Brysbaert norms with the 925 word Paivio con-
