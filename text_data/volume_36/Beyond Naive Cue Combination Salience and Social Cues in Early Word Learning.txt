equally-salient toys and labeled it three times over the course of ∼10 seconds. In Experiment 2, the speaker produced the same
social cues and the same label as in Experiment 1, but the target object was either the more perceptually salient toy (b), or
the less perceptually salient toy (c). These manipulations allowed us to measure the contributions of both salience and social
