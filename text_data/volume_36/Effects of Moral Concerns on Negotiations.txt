moral sensitivities in both types of foundations are:

• Fairness/Reciprocity: A concern for justice, rights and

• In-group/Loyalty: A concern with issues of loyalty and

• Authority/Subversion: A concern with issues associated
   with showing respect and obedience to authority.
• Purity/Sanctity: A concern for purity and sanctity.

   We hypothesize that Individual foundations would
interact with the agent’s expressed emotion and Binding
foundations would interact with the social status of the
opponent. This is because we expect Individualizing
foundations are closely related to an individual’s emotional
status, whereas Binding principles are more related to
people’s roles in the group. To measure the degree to which
people value each of five foundations, we used the 32-item
