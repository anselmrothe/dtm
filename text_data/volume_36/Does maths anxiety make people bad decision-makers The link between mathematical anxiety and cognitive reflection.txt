unemployment, mental and physical illness, as well as
higher rates of arrest and incarceration (Gross, Hudson &
Price, 2009). Low numeracy is also associated with
impaired risk comprehension, and it leads to biases in
judgment and decision making (see Gigerenzer,
Gaissmaier, Kurz-Milcke et al., 2008; Reyna, Nelson, Han
& Dieckmann, 2009 for reviews). Although meta-analyses
suggested correlations of around -.30 between maths
performance and maths anxiety (e.g., Hembree, 1990),
maths anxiety is not always paired with low levels of
numeracy (cf., Ashcraft & Krause, 2007). Thus, it is of
interest, whether maths anxiety is associated with impaired
decision-making skills, when the effects of numeracy are
controlled for.
Lab-based investigations have revealed the cognitive
mechanisms underpinning the negative effects of maths
anxiety. When solving arithmetical problems, participants
with high maths anxiety have higher error rates, especially
in the case of complex problems (e.g., Faust, Ashcraft, &
Fleck, 1996). Participants with high maths anxiety also
often show a characteristic pattern of responding quickly
to problems, displaying a “local avoidance” of the
uncomfortable test situation (cf., Faust et al., 1996), and
probably decreasing their chances of generating correct
responses. Studies have also indicated that maths anxiety
has an online effect on maths performance through
hampering working memory resources (Ashcraft & Kirk,
2001; Mattarella-Micke, Mateo, Kozak et al., 2011).
The aim of the following studies was to explore the link
between mathematical anxiety and individuals’ decisionmaking abilities. Our indicator of decision-making skills
was the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005),
which is a short test measuring a person’s tendency to
override an intuitively compelling response, and to engage
in further reflection which can lead to a correct solution.
As an example, consider the following item:
A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00
more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? ______
cents.
Although the correct response is 5 cents, many
participants give the response “10 cents”, which seems to
pop into mind effortlessly. Cognitive reflection involves
the ability to effectively monitor and correct such
impulsive response tendencies.

Abstract
When asked to solve mathematical problems, some people
experience anxiety and threat, which can lead to impaired
maths performance. The present studies investigated the
link between maths anxiety and performance on the
cognitive reflection test (CRT). The CRT is a measure of a
person’s ability to resist intuitive response tendencies, and
it correlates strongly with important real-life outcomes,
such as time preferences, risk-taking, and rational
thinking. Experiment 1 demonstrated that mathematical
anxiety was a significant predictor of cognitive reflection,
even after controlling for the effects of mathematical
knowledge and test anxiety. In Experiment 2 both working
memory load and mathematical anxiety were associated
with lower levels of cognitive reflection. A potential
explanation is that maths anxiety is linked to lower levels
of cognitive reflection, because anxious thoughts burden
working memory resources. Given earlier findings that
showed a close link between cognitive reflection, unbiased
decisions and rationality, our results suggest that
mathematical anxiety might be negatively related to
individuals’ ability to make advantageous choices and
good decisions.
Keywords: cognitive reflection test; decision making; dualtask manipulation; heuristics and biases; mathematical
anxiety; numeracy; rationality; test anxiety; working
memory.

The feeling of tension, apprehension and fear that some
people experience when they have to deal with maths
content has been termed mathematical anxiety (Ashcraft,
2002). Maths anxiety interferes with maths performance
and it leads to negative maths-related attitudes and selfperceptions, an avoidance of elective maths courses, and it
also affects people’s career opportunities and career
choices (Hembree, 1990). Whereas the negative
consequences of maths anxiety on educational outcomes
are well-documented, it is less clear whether maths anxiety
also affects people’s behaviour in other contexts.
This question is particularly interesting, given the wellknown effects of numeracy levels on an individual’s reallife functioning. Indeed, low numeracy is associated with
reduced economic productivity (Williams, Clements,
Oleinikova & Tarvin, 2003), higher rates of

1042

Cognitive reflection was found to be negatively related
to temporal discounting (i.e., the tendency to prefer
smaller, immediately available rewards over larger
rewards which will be available later), and positively
related to choosing gambles with higher expected values
(Frederick, 2005). Further studies showed that the CRT
was also related to some typical heuristics and biases (e.g.,
Liberali, Reyna, Furlan et al., 2012; Toplak, West &
Stanovich, 2011). Notably, some of these tasks (e.g.,
syllogistic reasoning problems) contained no numerical
information. Furthermore, although the CRT correlates
with measures of intelligence and numeracy (e.g.,
Frederick, 2005) it was found to explain additional
variance in reasoning and decision-making tasks when it
was administered together with measures of intelligence
and numeracy (Liberali et al., 2012; Toplak et al., 2011).
Overall, these results demonstrate that the CRT is a very
powerful predictor of a person’s ability to make unbiased
judgments and rational decisions on a variety of tasks.
In the studies that we report below we tested the
hypothesis that maths anxiety might be related to
performance on the CRT. We based this prediction on the
observation that maths anxiety leads to a tendency to
generate and accept responses quickly, without taking the
opportunity to correct mistakes (cf., Faust et al., 1996). In
other words, it seems that maths anxiety reduces cognitive
reflection.
In summary, in the following studies, we tested the
prediction that maths anxiety is linked to relatively poor
performance on the CRT. In Experiment 1 we tested this
hypothesis while we controlled for the effects of maths
knowledge and test anxiety. Experiment 2 investigated a
potential mechanism underlying this relationship.

Method
Participants The participants were 405 psychology
students (Mage= 20.3; SD = 3.1; range 18 to 53 years; 81%
females) from the University of Florence, Italy.
Materials Cognitive reflection test (CRT; Frederick,
2005): The CRT is a three-item test which consists of
word problems including numerical information (see an
example above). A composite score was calculated, based
on the sum of correct responses.
Mathematics Prerequisites for Psychometrics (MPP; Galli,
Chiesi, & Primi, 2011): This test measures the
mathematics skills needed by students enrolling in
introductory statistics courses. The test consists of 30
multiple-choice problems. Cronbach’s alpha was .80.
Abbreviated Maths Anxiety Scale (AMAS, Hopko,
Mahadevan, Bare & Hunt, 2003; see details on the Italian
adaptation in Primi, Busdraghi, Tomasetto et al., in
submission). This 9-item scale measures maths anxiety
experienced by students in learning and test situations.
Participants have to respond on the basis of how anxious
they would feel during the events specified, using a 5point response scale. Cronbach’s alpha was .87.
Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI, Spielberger, 1977). The scale
contains 20 items designed to measure anxiety associated
with test-taking situations. Participants have to respond on
the basis of how they would generally feel during the
events specified using a 4-point response scale. In our
sample, Cronbach’s alpha was .93.
Procedure The scales were presented in a paper-andpencil format, and students worked through the tasks
individually. The order of presentation was: MPP, TAI,
AMAS and CRT. Participants were informed that
participation was voluntary and anonymous, and they were
asked to give written informed consent. The average
administration time was 50 minutes.

Experiment 1
In Experiment 1 we tested the prediction that maths
anxiety is negatively associated with cognitive reflection.
Building on earlier claims that the CRT is “not just
another numeracy scale” (cf., Liberali et al, 2012; p.361),
but also a potent indicator of a person’s general ability to
avoid tempting, easy-to-generate heuristic responses, we
expected that the negative relationship between maths
anxiety and the CRT will be present, even when we
control for the effects of a person’s general mathematics
knowledge.
Specifically, we tested a path model in which
mathematical anxiety is directly related to poor
performance on the CRT. Additionally, we hypothesized
an indirect link between maths anxiety and cognitive
reflection through general mathematics knowledge.
Finally, we also tested the potential effect of test anxiety
on these links. We wanted to control for the effects of test
anxiety (see also Devine, Fawcett, Szucs & Dowker,
2012), as maths anxiety and test anxiety show moderate
correlations, and it has been argued that maths anxiety
could be just a form of test anxiety (Richardson &
Woolfolk, 1980).

Results
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for our measures,
and the correlations between them. As expected, maths
anxiety and maths knowledge were both significantly
correlated with the CRT, and maths anxiety was also
significantly correlated with maths knowledge. Finally,
maths anxiety was also related to test anxiety.
To further understand the mechanism underlying the
relationships between these variables, we tested the
hypothesis that maths knowledge mediates the effect of
maths anxiety on cognitive reflection. Recently,
researchers (e.g., Hayes, 2009) have recommended the use
of the bootstrapping procedure over the Sobel test in
assessing indirect effects of mediation models, as the
bootstrapping procedure does not impose the assumption
of normality of the sampling distribution on indirect
effects. In our study, the mediation hypothesis was tested
with SPSS macro (the INDIRECT procedure) for
bootstrapping (with 5000 bootstrap samples) to estimate
95% confidence interval (95 CI) (for more details see
Preacher & Hayes, 2008).

We estimated the indirect effect of maths anxiety on
cognitive reflection, quantified as the product of the
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression coefficient
estimating maths knowledge from maths anxiety (path a in
Figure 1), and the OLS regression coefficient estimating
cognitive reflection from maths knowledge controlling for
math anxiety (path b in Figure 1). A bias-corrected
bootstrap-confidence interval (CI) for the product of these
paths that does not include zero provides evidence of a
significant indirect effect of maths anxiety on cognitive
reflection through maths knowledge (Preacher & Hayes,
2008). The INDIRECT procedure revealed a significant
indirect effect of maths anxiety on cognitive reflection
through maths knowledge (point estimate = -0.01, 95%
CI= -0.02 to - 0.004). Kappa squared was 0.079 (95% CI =
0.026, to 0.132) indicating a medium effect size for the
indirect effect (Preacher & Kelly, 2011). Figure 1 also
shows the significant parameter associated with path c’,
which indicates a direct effect of maths anxiety on the
CRT.

between maths anxiety, maths knowledge, and cognitive
reflection (a, b, c’ are unstandardized OLS regression
coefficients;**p<.01; ***p<.001).
In sum, the results show that, once the effect of maths
knowledge on cognitive reflection was controlled for, the
effect of maths anxiety on cognitive reflection was still
significant. Overall, the results indicate that the effect of
maths anxiety on the CRT was partially mediated by
mathematical knowledge, but even when this effect was
controlled for, there was a direct effect of maths anxiety on
the CRT. To investigate whether these effects were
affected by test anxiety we included test anxiety as
covariate in the mediation model simultaneously with the

1044

In Experiment 1 we tested the prediction that maths
anxiety is associated with reduced cognitive reflection,
and that this relationship is present even when the
potential indirect link between maths anxiety and
cognitive reflection through maths knowledge is
controlled for. We expected this on the basis of earlier
findings which showed that maths anxiety leads to a
tendency to impulsively accept incorrect responses,
without much reflection (cf., Faust et al., 1996). We also
tested the potential effects of test anxiety on the links
between maths anxiety, maths knowledge and cognitive
reflection.
The results confirmed our predictions. Specifically, we
have found both a direct link between maths anxiety and
cognitive reflection, and an indirect link through maths
knowledge. These results have several implications. One is
that maths anxiety is not only linked to impaired
performance in arithmetical problems which are presented
in the form of numbers and symbols, but in word problems
with numerical content. To the best of our knowledge, our
study was the first to test the link between maths anxiety
and the ability to solve maths word problems.
Nevertheless, our aim was not simply to demonstrate this
link. Indeed, the CRT is considered to be more than just a
maths task (cf. Liberali et al., 2012). We expected, and
found, that the link between maths anxiety and cognitive
reflection was not simply the consequence of lower
numeracy levels, or a reduced ability to apply maths
knowledge in highly maths anxious individuals. Indeed,
when we controlled for the effect of maths knowledge, the
link between maths anxiety and the CRT was still
significant. Overall, our results suggest that maths anxiety
is linked to maths performance in two ways: directly, and
through an association with reduced maths knowledge.
Whereas these results clearly demonstrate that there is an
association between maths anxiety and cognitive
reflection, the causal link between these constructs is
unclear. We hypothesized that maths anxiety led to a
reduction in cognitive reflection. Nevertheless, in theory, it
is also possible that reduced cognitive reflection leads to
increased maths anxiety. Thus, one aim of Experiment 2
was to better understand the link between maths anxiety
and cognitive reflection.
Ashcraft and Kirk (2001) demonstrated that the effects
of maths anxiety arose from the burden that anxious
thoughts imposed on working memory (WM). Other lines
of research (e.g., De Neys, 2006) demonstrated that in the
case of tasks which involved a conflict between a heuristic
and a normatively correct response, employing a WM load
decreased normative performance, and increased
participants’ tendency to give a heuristic response. Given

that the CRT problems involve a heuristic-normative
conflict, we expected that a WM load will lead to a
reduction in normative responding. That is, anxiety and
WM load affect cognitive reflection in a similar way.

randomly allocated to the control, low load or high load
condition.
Materials Maths anxiety was assessed by the AMAS
(Cronbach’s alpha: .92). Participants were also
administered the CRT, but instead of generating a
response, participants had to select from three options: the
correct response, the typical heuristic response and an
atypical response. We administered the CRT in this format
in order to avoid a potential floor effect, given that, even
without a secondary load, performance tends to be low.
The secondary task was the Dot Memory Task (DMT), a
classic spatial storage task previously used by De Neys
(2006) and Gillard et al. (2009). A 3x3 matrix, filled with
three (low-load condition) or four dots (high-load
condition) was presented. Participants had as much time as
they needed to memorize the pattern. Then they solved a
CRT problem, and they had to recall the dot pattern
afterwards. Participants in the control condition worked
through the CRT problems without distraction.
Procedure The AMAS was presented in a paper-andpencil format. The CRT was presented on the computer,
together with the DMT. Participants solved a practice
problem before working through the test problems. For the
CRT, both accuracy and reaction times were recorded.
Immediately after completing the CRT, participants were
asked to report the level of anxiety that they experienced
while working through the problems on a 10-point scale.
The average testing time was 35 minutes (participants also
solved some other problems which are not reported here).

Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, we adopted a procedure which was
previously used by De Neys (2006). In this study,
participants had to memorize either simple or complex dot
patterns (i.e., they were allocated into either a low- or a
high WM-load condition) or they performed the task
without a cognitive load. Additionally, they were asked to
solve problems with a conflict between a tempting
heuristic response and a normative response.
Based on the idea that anxious thoughts burden WM
resources, we hypothesized that WM load and anxiety will
affect reasoning performance in a similar way (i.e., they
will be linked to performance decrements on the CRT).
Besides their relationship with reasoning accuracy, we
were also interested in the link between WM-load and
maths anxiety and reaction times on the CRT, as well as
self-reported anxiety while participants completed the
tasks. The purpose of including these additional measures
was to better understand the mechanisms through which
anxiety and working memory load might affect cognitive
reflection. Whereas there are good reasons to expect that
anxious participants will rush through the tasks (e.g., Faust
et al., 1996), and report higher levels of anxiety while
solving the CRT problems, WM-load in itself might not
lead to these consequences. In addition, including a
measure of anxiety that participants experienced while
they worked through the problems made it possible to
assess the ecological validity of the AMAS with regard to
solving the CRT problems.
Finally, it seems plausible that the negative relationship
between mathematical anxiety and cognitive reflection
arose in Experiment 1 because maths anxiety reduced
cognitive reflection. Nevertheless, in theory, it is also
possible that reduced cognitive reflection leads to
increased maths anxiety. If this was the case, the WM-load
manipulation (which is expected to reduce cognitive
reflection) should lead to an increase in participants’ levels
of anxiety while they are working through the tasks.
In summary, we expected that maths anxiety would be
negatively related to cognitive reflection, and to the time
that participants spend on solving the problems. By
contrast, we expected that WM-load would not result in
decreased reaction times, and would not lead to higher
levels of anxiety.

Results
Accuracy on the DMT was high in both the low- (91%)
and high-load (93%) conditions. The proportion of
atypical responses on the CRT task was extremely low
(3%), indicating that participants primarily selected the
heuristic and correct responses. As a preliminary step for
our main analyses, we created high and low maths anxiety
groups by performing a median split, with participants
with an AMAS score of 20 or below included in the low
anxiety group (n=46).

Method
The purpose of our first analysis was to test the effects of
cognitive load and mathematical anxiety on cognitive
reflection (see Table 2 for descriptive statistics). A 2x3
ANOVA with maths anxiety group (high/low) and WM
load (high/low/none) as between-subjects factors indicated
a significant effect of maths anxiety (F(1,88)=4.15,

Participants Eighty-nine psychology students from a UK
university participated in the study (66 females; Mage= 22
years 4 months; SD = 8.11; range: 18-56 years). The
participants were either offered ungraded course credit or a
small payment for participation. Participants were

(F(2,88)=3.30, p=.042,p2=.07). There was no interaction
between maths anxiety and cognitive load (p=.37).
Our next analysis investigated the effects of maths
anxiety and WM load on reaction times on the CRT. A
2x3 ANOVA with maths anxiety group (high/low) and
WM load (high/low/none) conditions indicated a
significant effect of maths anxiety (F(1,88)=4.57,

p=.036,p =.05), but no effect of WM load (p=.27), and
no interaction (p=.27). Participants with low anxiety spent
on average 22.29 seconds (SD=16.10), whereas highly
anxious participants spent 15.31 seconds (SD=7.31) on
each problem.
We also checked the effects of maths anxiety and WM
load on self-reported anxiety levels. This was important in
establishing the ecological validity of the AMAS in
relation to the CRT. A 2x3 ANOVA with maths anxiety
group (high/low) and WM load (high/low/none)
conditions indicated a significant effect of maths anxiety

(F(1,88)=37.18, p<.001,p =.53), but no significant effect
of WM load (p=.53), and no interaction (p=.85). Highly
anxious participants’ average self-reported anxiety level
was 4.91 (SD=2.19) on a 10-point scale, while the average
rating of participants with low AMAS scores was 2.52
(SD=1.36). There was a strong correlation between
participants’ self-reported anxiety and their AMAS scores
(r(86)=.56, p<.001).

performed worse on the CRT than students with low levels
of anxiety. This effect was still present when we
controlled for participants’ maths knowledge and test
anxiety (in Experiment 1). Experiment 2 also shed light on
some of the mechanisms behind this effect.
Specifically, in line with Ashcraft and Kirk (2001) and
Mattarella-Micke et al. (2011), we demonstrated that
maths anxiety was associated with performance
decrements, which were similar to the effect of WM load.
To the best of our knowledge, our Experiment 2 is the
only one, apart from Ashcraft and Kirk (2001), to
demonstrate this through a dual-task manipulation, and it
is the first one, which demonstrates this in the case of
word problems including numbers. Additionally,
Experiment 2 also showed that mathematical anxiety was
related to a tendency to rush through problems (see also
Faust et al., 1996). However, this effect did not arise as the
result of hampered working memory resources.
These findings have several important implications.
First, our results demonstrate that maths anxiety arises,
and affects performance in low-stakes situations, and in
the case of word problems including numbers. Second, we
showed that maths anxiety was linked to cognitive
reflection in two different ways. Indeed Experiment 1
demonstrated a mediating role of general maths
knowledge between maths anxiety and cognitive
reflection. Additionally, maths anxiety was directly linked
to participants’ ability to reflect on their own performance,
and to detect and correct their own errors (as proposed by
Faust et al., 1996; and indicated by the direct link between
maths anxiety and cognitive reflection). Experiment 2
suggested that this link between anxiety and performance
on the CRT could have been the result of the reduced
availability of cognitive resources in anxious participants,
and/or the shorter time they spent on the problems.
As we described in the introduction, the CRT is
considered to be more than just a numeracy test (cf.,
Liberali et al., 2012). Indeed, it correlates highly with
tasks measuring risky decision-making, future discounting,
and rational thinking (Frederick, 2005; Liberali et al.,
2012; Toplak et al., 2011). Much research shows the
negative effects of low numeracy on judgement and
decision making (Gigerenzer et al., 2006; Reyna et al.,
2009), as well as on employability, mental and physical
health, and criminal behaviour (e.g., Gross et al., 2009).
The relationship between maths anxiety and cognitive
reflection that we demonstrated in our studies suggests
that the negative effects of maths anxiety might also
extend to individuals’ decision making skills. In fact, it is
likely that maths anxiety affects individuals’ economic
behaviour, as well as their understanding of risks. Thus,
researchers of judgment and decision making should take
into account maths anxiety as a potential source of
individual differences in decision making.
Finally, our results are also relevant for researchers of
decision making and reasoning in terms of our
understanding of what cognitive reflection is. The CRT is

Discussion
In line with our hypotheses, Experiment 2 demonstrated
that both anxiety and WM load were associated with poor
performance on the CRT. This result support earlier claims
that anxious thoughts regarding mathematical content act
in a similar way as WM-load (Ashcraft & Kirk, 2001;
Mattarella-Micke et al., 2011). At the same time, our
results also demonstrate that the effects of maths anxiety
do not simply arise through hampering WM resources.
Indeed, in contrast with maths anxiety, WM load did not
lead to reduced response times.
Another interesting finding is that although WM load
reduced cognitive reflection, it did not lead to increased
levels of self-reported anxiety. This suggests that whereas
increased anxiety might reduce cognitive reflection, a
manipulation of cognitive reflection does not affect
anxiety levels. This supports our hypothesis regarding the
causal link between maths anxiety and cognitive
reflection.
Finally, the fact that self-reported anxiety levels
correlated strongly with AMAS scores confirms the
ecological validity of the AMAS in predicting anxiety
levels elicited by word problems including numerical
content, which were presented in a low-stakes situation.

General discussion
In two experiments we tested the hypothesis that maths
anxiety is linked to reduced cognitive reflection. As
expected, we found that students with high maths anxiety

an extremely popular measure, as it only takes a few
minutes to administer, and, at the same time, it is one of
the best predictors of rational thinking and decisionmaking skills. Nevertheless, our findings clearly show that
rather than simply measuring a metacognitive trait, the
CRT also has a significant mathematics component.
Indeed, it is not only related to a person’s maths ability,
but also to their levels of maths anxiety. Thus, our findings
call for the urgent need for researchers to better understand
the cognitive bases of “cognitive reflection”, and the
tendency for people to jump into conclusions without a
second thought.
