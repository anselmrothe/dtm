accompany nearly any type of depicted actions, not just a
prototypical lateral running figure. Also, contrary to studies
using only straight lines for lateral motions, motion lines in
comics may be curved, may spiral around in a circle, or may
depict points along a path. No previous studies have actually
looked at the understanding of motion lines within the
naturalistic context of a visual narrative sequence as
opposed to an individual image.
   Previous studies have also been limited in their
experimental measurements and methodologies. Most
studies of motion lines have focused on recall tasks and/or
subjective ratings. Thus, despite the claims that motion lines
may connect to basic perceptual processes (e.g., Burr, 2000;
Kim & Francis, 1998), no studies have yet examined the
online comprehension of motion lines. In order to overcome
these limitations, we carried out two experiments that
analyzed participants’ comprehension of motion lines
embedded in the naturalistic context of comic strips.
