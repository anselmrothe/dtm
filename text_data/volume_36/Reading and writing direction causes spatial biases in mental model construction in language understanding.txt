Materials For the reading task, we prepared a 1195 words
fiction narrative in Spanish. Words were printed in 15
points Arial font. The text occupied four pages, each one
containing five to six paragraphs of four to six lines each
one.
  For the drawing task we selected nine common
geometrical shapes which could be drawn easily (square,
rectangle, cross, rhombus, triangle, circle, trapezium,
oval, pentagon). As a result of combining the names of
those geometrical shapes, 441 sentences describing a
between relation among three different shapes were
constructed. For example, “The circle is between the cross
and the rectangle” or “The oval is between the triangle
and the rhombus.” All sentences referred to completely
static scenes without any agentive structure.
  From this set of 441 sentences, 40 sentences were                 Figure 1: a) Standard L-R text; b) Mirror-reversed text;c)
