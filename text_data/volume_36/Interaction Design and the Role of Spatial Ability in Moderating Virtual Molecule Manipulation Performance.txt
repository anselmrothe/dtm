generalize these findings to other object rotation tasks (e.g.
Ruddle & Jones, 2001).
   In order to improve generalizability, the task in the present
study required manipulation of a virtual molecular model to
match the orientation and internal configuration of a
simultaneously displayed 3D model of the same molecule.
This task involved two manipulations of the virtual model: 1)
a global rotation of the entire molecule and 2) a local twisting         b)
rotation of a bond within the molecule. The additional local
rotation made this task more complex than typical virtual
object rotation tasks that involve only a global rotation of a
3D model (e.g. Ruddle & Jones, 2001). By using 3D models
rather than 2D diagrams for target orientations, the present
task focused on the virtual manipulation itself, and was not
confounded by participantsâ ability to interpret diagrams.
   Klatzky, Wu, Sheldon & Stetten (2008) suggest that
interfaces providing perceptually mediated interaction foster
better performance and learning than cognitively mediated
interfaces. Perceptual mediation allows cognitively
demanding processes to be offloaded onto more automatic
systems; this frees up cognitive resources to be re-allocated
