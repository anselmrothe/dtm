In a fully within-subjects design, each participant completed
two tasks—the Integer and Whole Number tasks—with task
order counterbalanced between participants. In both tasks,
participants had to judge the relative magnitude of visually-
presented single-digit numbers. They responded by stepping
forward or backward onto rectangular, colored targets on the
floor (Fig. 1, left panel). Targets were approximately two
