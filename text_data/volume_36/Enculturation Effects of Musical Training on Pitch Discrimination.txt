Perceptual Discrimination Task
Response data were transformed to a comprehensive
measure of performance, d’, which accounts for sensitivity
to the signal (correct responses) while controlling for the
noise (false alarms). Because of the structure of the task,
deviating tones were treated as the “targets” and responding
on a “target” trial was coded as a “hit”; responding to a
prototypical, non-deviating, tone was coded as a “false
alarm.” For each scale and instrument condition, we                  Figure 1. The difference in performance between the trained
