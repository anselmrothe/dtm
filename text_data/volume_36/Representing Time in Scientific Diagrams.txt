Visually, the heat map makes it obvious that (a) the expres-

            Representing Time on a Circle
Since rhythmic activities regularly return the system to the
same state, a circle offers an alternative way to represent
time. This, of course, is the representational format that has
long been used in mechanical clocks, albeit typically using
the circle to represent 12 rather than 24 hours.                            Figure 5. Relógio et al.’s (2011) use of concentric

glyphs (colored boxes for genes, correspondingly colored
circles and ovals for proteins, white rectangles for promot-
ers, etc.). Arrows show that the operation of a part has an
effect on another part. Dark lines indicate spatial compart-
ments (the cytoplasm and the nucleus). Incorporating time is
a challenge. The various activities occur at different times of
day. The operation associated with each arrow takes time,
and each cycle of activity that returns the mechanism to the
same state takes approximately 24 hours, but nothing else
about timing is shown.

   One strategy for bringing time into a mechanism diagram
is to position different states of the mechanism around a
single circle that is marked so as to track time within the 24
hours of one complete cycle. The following diagrams illus-
trate different ways circadian biologists have instantiated
this strategy, each with its own compromises. In Figure 7,
Hirano (2013) achieved a visually simple–but conceptually
complex–diagram by extracting the CRY cycle from Figure
6 and adding time markers. There are similarities: a single
arrow (bottom) suffices to represent the sequence of opera-
tions involved in gene expression (transcription of the gene              Figure 8. Ye et al.’s (2011) representation of four stages in

day and two during the night, focusing especially on the
CRY-PER relationship. (Note that panel C is to the right of
D, making the arrangement cyclic.) As one moves between
panels, the key changes are indicated. For example, as the
end of day approaches (moving from panel A to panel B),
the PER:CRY dimer enters the nucleus and dissociates into
PER and CRY. The red X indicates that Bmal1 is not being
transcribed. With the shift to early night (panel C), CRY
binds to BMAL1 and CLOCK on the Per and Cry E-boxes,
stopping their transcription, while Bmal1 transcription re-
sumes. Finally, these proteins are removed from the E-box
(panel D). (For visual simplicity, the conventional rectangu-
lar glyphs for the Per and Cry genes are combined into one.)
   One of the challenges in constructing mechanism dia-
grams is that parts engage in different classes of operations            Figure 10. Golden et al.'s (2007) representation of the

   Although the cycle in Figure 9 is assumed to take 24

135°, Golden, Cassone, and LiWang (2007) were able to
show the states around a 24-hour clock face (Figure 10).
They also show the roles of two other proteins, KaiA and
KaiB. When bound to KaiC, KaiA facilitates the phosphory-
