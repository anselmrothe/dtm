Design
Younger and older groups of children participated in one of
eight between-subject experimental conditions resulting from
the crossing of the variables Comparison (No Comparison vs.
Comparison), Contrast (No Contrast vs. Contrast) and
Distinctiveness      (Low      Distinctiveness     vs.    High
Distinctiveness) (See Figure 1).
Materials
Seven sets of six artificial grey-scale objects pictured on
cards were created for each condition of distinctiveness. The
dimensions of the cards were 12*9 cm (width*height) and the
dimensions of the objects pictured on the cards were                     Fig. 1 Sample stimulus sets and instructions used in the
