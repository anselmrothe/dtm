task? A social cognitive scientist might argue that if you
are talkative in all aspects of your life, then you will
consider yourself as talkative based on your self-
reflections and the exogenous evaluations made by your
family and friends. In this case, talkativeness is a stable
personality trait and the proposition “I talk a lot” is
directly stored in your semantic memory, and thus the
rating judgment will be quick and reliable.
   In contrast, if you do not have either of the following
propositions—“I talk a lot” or “I do not talk a lot”—in
your memory, you should compute the truth of the
proposition at the moment. You will try to retrieve
episodes concerning your talkativeness from your
memory and may find that, for instance, you are eloquent
