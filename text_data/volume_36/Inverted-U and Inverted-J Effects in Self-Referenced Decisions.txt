Abstract
Rating one’s own personality traits is a common self-referential
information processing task. The current paper examined the
mechanism underlying this sort of trait-rating task by using a PC
cursor tracing technique (Shiina, 2011a, b). The target
phenomenon of interest was the inverted-U effect observed in
trait ratings. The PC cursor tracing technique analyzed response
times, tangential velocities, and rapid cursor movements
(strokes). Results supported Klein’s notion (Klein et al., 2002)
that self-referenced episodic and semantic memories are used
independently when making these trait decisions.

Trait Ratings and Inverted-U Effects
Personality trait rating tasks are the typical research
paradigm in the field of self-referential judgments and
decisions, which are an important topic for social and
neurocognitive scientists (Lieberman, 2007) as well as
psychometricians. When making trait ratings with Likerttype scales, it was found that trait rating needs more time
in the moderate than in the extremes of the scale.
Response characteristics of this type can emerge in other
dependent variables, and Mignault, Marley, & Chaudhuri
(2008) called them, the inverted-U response time, error,
and uncertainty effects, respectively. The inverted-U
effect has been observed in two major domains that use
scale-like response formats: personality trait ratings (Judd
& Kulik, 1980: Kuiper, 1981; Mueller, Thompson, &
Dugan, 1986; Akrami, Hedlund, & Ekehammar, 2007)
and absolute identification judgments in psychophysics
(Stewart, Brown, & Chater, 2005: Brown, Marley, Donkin,
& Heathcote, 2008).
Two views on of self-referential ratings If you are asked
to rate whether “You talk a lot” on a Likert-type rating
scale, what is the mental computation needed to do this
task? A social cognitive scientist might argue that if you
are talkative in all aspects of your life, then you will
consider yourself as talkative based on your selfreflections and the exogenous evaluations made by your
family and friends. In this case, talkativeness is a stable
personality trait and the proposition “I talk a lot” is
directly stored in your semantic memory, and thus the
rating judgment will be quick and reliable.
In contrast, if you do not have either of the following
propositions—“I talk a lot” or “I do not talk a lot”—in
your memory, you should compute the truth of the
proposition at the moment. You will try to retrieve
episodes concerning your talkativeness from your
memory and may find that, for instance, you are eloquent
in public but very quiet at home. This creates an internal
conflict, which leads to settling on a midpoint rating. The
rating judgment will be slow and unstable. The
combination of the above two different modes of
processes, that is, the quick retrieval and slow deliberation
processes, creates an inverted-U effect.
A psychometrician will embrace a completely different

view (Thurstone, 1959; Tourangeau, Rips, & Rasinski,
2000). She or he first assumes a psychological continuum
of “talkativeness” and further assumes that people have a
specific position on the continuum. The self-rating is
considered as a self-observation on the continuum.
Although there do exist many sophisticated scaling
models, it is reasonable to say that the most popular and
oft-used method is still Likert-type scaling procedure
within the framework of the classical test theory. For the
psychometrician the rating scale is a black-box and little
attention will be paid to the internal information
processing. Psychometric view will predict that the rating
times are flat across rating categories. A more elaborated
view may predict, however, that the highest and lowest
categories can have less chances of being confused
because they have only one neighbor category.
In sum, both views can predict the inverted-U patterns
via completely different assumptions and thus a method
that can produce another type of information is needed.
Trajectory tracing The current study attempted to
understand the inverted-U effects by employing the
technique of PC cursor trajectory tracing (Figure1), in
view of the recent upsurge in cursor trajectory analysis
that can capture cognitive components of decisions (for
reviews, see Song & Nakayama, 2009; Freeman, Dale, &
Farmer, 2011). By analyzing cursor trajectories in PC
based ratings, it was expected that the method could
provide direct evidence showing that the inverted-U effect
is a joint effect of extreme trait ratings that are memorybased and made without conflict, and moderate trait
ratings that are modulated by internal conflict resolution.
A total of 16 rating tasks (Table 1), 10 of which pertained
to personality traits and thus to self-referenced decisions,
were analyzed and contrasted.

The Data
Overview The rating data are a compilation of the
author’s past studies over a 5-year period (Shiina, 2008,
2011a, 2011b, 2012). The data were gathered from 568
participants and the same experimental procedure and PCs
were used. Tasks 0-10 were administered to the pool of
140 subjects. The other tasks were administered to
different pools of participants. This was done because as
many as 16 tasks (Table 1) were compared at the same
time in the current study to detect the inverted-U,
inverted-J, and other patterns.
Procedure The form shown in Figure 1 was used to
record trajectories, final rating judgments, and response
times. There were 5 ordered categories with either a set of
numerical labels from 1 to 5 as shown in Figure 1 or with
a set of verbal labels “no”, “don’t know”, and “yes” in
the position of categories 1, 3, and 5, respectively. There
were no labels at the positions of 2 and 4. The rating
experiment was subject-paced. As soon as the subject
clicked the “Start” button superimposed at the center of
the form, the button was erased and a problem appeared in
the display box in the center of the form. Participants were
asked to click a “correct” or “most suitable” category
button as quickly as possible. The cursor trajectory and
the time between the initial and last clicks were registered.
Then “Start” button reappeared to proceed to the next trial
by calling up the next problem. An experimental session
included several of the tasks in Table 1 and thus the
number of trials for each subject was around 100. The
experimental program was written in VBA for Microsoft
Excel and the experiment was run on Excel.
Tasks Sixteen tasks were used across different cognitive
and self-referenced domains (Table 1). The first task
(Task 0) was a Benchmark task in which one of the
numbers from 1 to 5 was randomly presented and subjects
were asked to click the corresponding button on the form.
A previous study (Shiina, 2008) showed that the
trajectories in this task show typical goal-directed (simple
reaching) movements and thus this task served as a
baseline that involved a minimum of cognitive workload.
Tasks 1-12 were internally-guided tasks with no correct
answers: Tasks 1-10 were standard psychological scales
that were the major target of the present study and Tasks
11-12 were cognitive tasks that evoke deep cognitive
processing but were not directly related to the self.
Tasks 13-15 were externally-guided tasks with correct
answers. In Task 13, the stimuli were simple math
expressions that included addition and subtraction of three
digits (e.g., 3-2+1). The participants’ clicked the correct
number as quickly as possible. Task 14 was a division
task in which participants divided one prime number by
another number (e.g., 17/13) and rounded the answer off
to the nearest integer to click the category button. Task 15
consisted of difficult geography quizzes that demand
deliberation. All the tasks were presented in Japanese. The
psychological scales were Japanese versions.
Participants The number of participants for each task is
shown in Table 1. All participants were Waseda
University undergraduates.

Response Time Analysis: Inverted-J RT Effect
Figure 2 displays the mean response times as a function of
the final category clicked for the 16 tasks. We can find
that 13 curves have and 3 curves do not have an invertedU shape. Interestingly, many of the inverted-U patterns
were from internally-guided (no correct answer) tasks
(Tasks 1–12). The 3 curves that were not inverted-U
shaped were from Benchmark, Addition and subtraction,
and Geography tasks.
Emergence of inverted-J patterns It was further
observed that in the 12 curves out of the 13 inverted-U
curves, YES responses (category 5 responses) were faster
than NO responses (category 1 responses). These response
patterns produced inverted-J rather than inverted-U
shapes and the exception was Task 14 (Division), which
was an externally-guided task. In Figure 2, panels (a) and
(b) show inverted-J patterns with different maxima. All
the inverted-J patterns were from internally-guided (no
correct answer) tasks (Tasks 1-12) including all the selfdescriptive psychological scales (Tasks 1-10).
The emergence of the inverted-J pattern in selfreferenced ratings is not new but has never been claimed
explicitly. We can see clear inverted-J-shaped patterns in
Mueller et al (1986, Figure 1, for trait adjectives) and
Akrami et al (2007, Figure 1, for Big 5 traits) as well,
although many of the previous studies do not include
graphs that show this relationship between rating
categories and a dependent variable. The reason why the
previous studies did not highlight the inverted-J shapes
would be that they dealt with relatively few traits and
descriptions and could not discover the statistical
regularity across traits.
Inverted-J patterns will be the target of the present study,
although more data is needed to conclude the generality of
inverted-J patterns in self-referenced or internally-guided
ratings.

A possible explanation of inverted-J patterns Klein,
Cosmides, Tooby, & Chance (2002) argue that judgments
about the self use two independent memories: an episodic
store, which represents specific events and behaviors
involving the self, and a semantic store, which includes
summaries of the personality traits abstracted from a set of
particular events. Klein et al. further argue that the two
memory systems are independently represented and used.
Within this framework, the inverted-J effect can be
schematically explained as follows: “Yes” responses are
the fastest because direct retrieval from semantic memory
is at work. “Don’t know” responses are the slowest
because, to arrive at this category, participants should first
compute the degree of consistency to the trait by using
episodic stores and then fail to attain high or low
consistency. Finally, “No” responses are intermediate
because both direct stores and computation using episodic
stores are at work.
An immediate criticism to this interpretation is that if
the affirmative proposition “I have Trait X” can be
directly stored in semantic memory, there is no logical
reason to exclude the possibility that a fuzzy proposition,
“I have Trait X moderately”, can be stored in the semantic
memory as well. The trajectory analysis now comes in.

Trajectory-Analysis 1: Averaged Velocity Shape
We define a trajectory as a time-indexed 2-dimensional
vector: ( x (t ), y (t )), 0  t  RT ). We first divide the RT by
256 to define a step size in time domain, and then

Tangential velocity is the speed of the trajectory, which
reflects task characteristics. See Shiina (2008, 2011a, b)
for more details.
Average tangential velocity The average tangential
velocity curves as a function of time and a final rating
category clicked were computed (Figure 3. Due to space
limitation, not all relevant figures could be presented). For
example, Figure 3a depicts the 5 average tangential
velocity curves in Benchmark Task corresponding to the
rating categories finally clicked. The numbers in the
parentheses are mean RTs. In this task, a cursor
movement should be a type of simple reaching movement
with an initial ballistic phase and a second corrective
control phase. Ballistic movements are quick and bellshaped, and imply that there is dissociation between motor
and cognitive components, because ballistic movements
are under feed-forward control and thus their initial
velocity and direction should be determined before the
initiation of the movement (Elliott, Helsen, & Chua, 2001).
In contrast, non-ballistic movements reflect the
examinee’s decisional conflict and vacillation. Therefore,
a ballistic movement can be used as a marker to indicate
no-hesitation. Because the curves in Figure 3a show an
initial large bell-shaped ballistic movement (a peak on the
left) followed by small corrective movements (small
vibrations on the right), we can define that a bell-shaped
curve whose top speed is over 200 dot/s is a ballistic
movement. With reference to this rule, we can judge that
the tangential velocities of the trajectories aiming at
categories 1 and 5 tended to be ballistic and the curves
toward the middle categories were non-ballistic.
More specifically, we can judge that there is no simple
reaching movement in Division and Indeterminacy Tasks,
and the trajectories aiming at categories 1 and 5 in
Extraversion Task (Figure 3b) are ballistic. Further, we
can observe in Figures 3c and 3d that all the curves moved
slowly in the initial period, which is apparently related to
reading or calculation.
This analysis might appear somewhat tautological
because there is no wonder if a quickly moving cursor
reaches its destination faster. This criticism would be
valid if the cursor movements were always optimal and
economical, but trajectories with unwasted motion were
very rare.
Because a ballistic movement is quick and reflects nohesitation, this analysis gives a crude explanation of the
inverted-U RT effect but cannot predict the inverted-J
effect. A finer analysis will be presented in the next
section.

could produce the 12 inverted-J curves for internally
guided tasks (Figure 2) very well (R2 = .94, F (4, 55)
=201.79, p<.0001, Figure 4). In this formula, the number
of letters comprising a question determines the overall
level of response times, the quadratic part generates
inverted-U shapes, and the CV part transforms U to J
meaning that the CV’s for Category 5 were small and for
the middle categories were large.
A natural interpretation of this result is that the
trajectories toward the middle categories were shuddering
and thus increased the response times. If the assumption
that trajectory-variability (CV) reflects internal conflict is
valid, we can infer a causal chain: internal fluctuation ->
trajectory perturbation ->longer response times ->
inverted-U (-J) effect.
The result and interpretation seem to be reasonable, but
we do not know why CV’s for the middle categories were
large and for Category 5 were small. The next analysis
addresses this question.

Trajectory-Analysis 3: Stroke Analysis
Shiina (2011b) reported that a cursor trajectory often
includes pulse-like movements (Figure 5) called strokes
and over 50% of velocity curves were single peaked in the
Benchmark Task whereas the rate was much lower in
other tasks. Therefore, another interpretation for average
velocities in Figure 3 is that they are a fusion of pulses
(strokes) reflecting pulse frequencies. Similarly, another
interpretation of CV values is that they are measuring
instability (time heterogeneity) of discrete events at time i.
Because ballistic single-stroke velocity curves imply no
internal hesitation whereas multiple stroke velocities
imply internal conflict, the proportion of single peaked
trajectories was calculated for each category in each task
(Figure 6, Shiina, 2011b). The figure looks disordered but
a clear J emerged by averaging the curves. The results
strongly supports the view that less internal conflict

Division Task (Shiina 2011b). The pulses are called
strokes. The abscissa is time and the ordinate is tangential
velocity.

1) The inverted-J RT effect occurred as a function of tasks,
especially when tasks were internally guided.
2) The tangential velocity analysis suggested that ballistic
movements are a plausible source of inverted-J effects.
3) The trajectory-variability analysis showed that the
trajectory variability index (CV) could produce a
reasonable quadratic regression model (Figure 4) that
mimics the inverted-J patterns in Figure 2.
4) The stroke analysis revealed that single peaked
trajectories, which can be interpreted as a marker of nonhesitation, are a source of quick responses and the
inverted-J effect.
5) It is plausible that participants’ conflict causes internal
fluctuations, which then manifests multiple-strokes and
trajectory vibrations that lead to the inverted-U effect.
6) The ultimate reason for the inverted-J effect is
unknown. A possible explanation is presented in the
following section.
It has been suggested that extreme ratings are memory
dependent whereas the middle ratings are process-

2923

dependent and these qualitatively different mechanisms
create the inverted-J effect. The emergence of the
inverted-J effect is by no means surprising for memory
researchers, whereas the effect is very difficult to explain
for psychometricians. Therefore, the implication of the
present results for psychometrics is that numbers arising
from rating decisions are qualitatively different.
What is the inverted-J effect? Why should the response
patterns be inverted-J shaped in self-description
judgments? A simple explanation would be as follows:
when a stimulus statement is either very consistent or very
inconsistent with the self-description in memory, rating
decisions becomes easier and quicker than when the
statement is neither consistent nor inconsistent. This
interpretation is rather faulty, however, because if the
stimulus statement is “I talk a lot” and you have the
proposition “I am average in talkativeness” directly in
memory, you should be able to check a moderate rating
category equally quickly. To validate the consistencybased interpretation, therefore, we should either prove that
very few intermediate propositions are stored in memory
or present direct evidence that moderate ratings tend to be
interrupted by decisional conflict. The contribution of the
present study is that it provided the behavioral evidence
that trajectories toward middle categories are fluctuating
and those toward extreme categories are stable, producing
the inverted-U effect.
Strictly speaking, the above explanation is valid only for
the inverted-U effect but not for the inverted-J effect,
because, if the probability that “I do not have Trait X” is
stored in memory is approximately the same as the
probability that “I have Trait X” is stored in memory, the
above explanation cannot account for the inverted-J effect.
Therefore, a supplementary assumption that there are
more affirmative propositions than negative propositions
in memory might be needed. For example, if you are a
teacher, then you are not a farmer, a fisher, or a carpenter,
and so on. Negative propositions would be too numerous
to be stored in memory and you need not (and should not)
store such an endless list in your memory. Of course, it is
undeniable that not a few negative propositions are stored
in semantic memory: the point is that the number of
propositions that correctly describe you should be far
fewer than the number of propositions that wrongly
describe you. The inverted-J effect may be a “Yes-effect”
arising from information parsimony and asymmetry in
memory. The “Yes-effects” would have a strong
connection to the acquiescence effect (Krosnick, 1999)
and SNARC effect (Dehaene, 2011), although more
research is needed to fully address this matter.
