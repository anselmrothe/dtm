explain the developmental trajectory of relational reasoning,
therefore, represents a parsimonious extension of each
approach that helps explain several key pieces of data.
   However, recent research has called into question the idea
that similarity-based generalization follows a universal,
across-the-board, perceptual-to-relational shift (Bulloch &
Opfer, 2009; Opfer & Bulloch, 2007). According to the
predictive validity view, children do not necessarily proceed
from generalization by perceptual features to generalization
by relational structure. Instead, they generalize flexibly over     Figure 1. An example trial from Bulloch and Opfer (2009). The
