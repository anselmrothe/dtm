Abstract
A number of open questions are still unanswered about
whether and how dyads perform better compared to individuals on memory tasks. The literature on collaborative recall
demonstrates a robust collaborative inhibition effect, where
participants do worse when remembering in collaborative contexts. However, a growing body of research suggests that this
inhibition can be ameliorated, or even reversed, under certain
task and social conditions. Here we construct nominal groups
(hypothetically optimal aggregates of individual performers)
to compare to collaborative groups. We observe collaborative
inhibition on two performance metrics (number of trivia clues
answered, speed of answering), but we find a facilitatory effect
of collaboration on two other performance metrics (accuracy,
number of clues subsequently recalled). We also show that familiarity can reduce this collaborative inhibition in many ways.

Introduction
In knowledge-based, joint-action tasks such as working on
crossword puzzles or playing team trivia games, success depends not only on the knowledge of each individual, but
the way that this knowledge is transferred, synthesized, and
generated at the interactive, group level. The current paper
uses a trivia task to allow us to connect the well-established
work on collaborative memory (and specifically, the collaborative recall paradigm) with the emerging joint-action literature. The collaborative recall paradigm is one of the most
frequently used methods of studying collaborative memory.
In this paradigm, participants are asked to reproduce a known
or learned list of items, either individually or in collaborative groups. Although the overall group product is often
higher than the product of controlled individual participants,
it almost always fails to outperform the nominal group product, consisting of the pooled, non-overlapping (i.e., a hypothetic, optimal combination of) items recalled by individuals
(Barnier, Sutton, Harris, & Wilson, 2008). That is, at the individual level, people remember better when working alone,
and don’t perform at their full potential during collaboration.
This robust finding is known as collaborative inhibition, and
is thought to result from participants’ disruption of each others’ unique retrieval strategies during recall (Basden, Basden,
Bryner, & III, 1997). Collaborative inhibition has been observed in a number of studies, many of which give specific
support to the retrieval disruption hypothesis (for a review,
see Rajaram & Pereira-Pasarin, 2010).
An innovative study by Meade, Nokes, and Morrow (2009)
challenged the ubiquity of collaborative inhibition. Memory
for previously studied flight scenarios was tested for groups

composed of expert pilots, novice pilots, or non-pilots. While
novices and non-pilots exhibited the standard collaborative
inhibition effect, expert pilots did not. In fact, the experts
exhibited collaborative facilitation–they were better at remembering together than remembering alone. Meade and
colleagues (2009) note that these results are consistent with
the retrieval disruption hypothesis, in that experts have similar training and knowledge that allows them, presumably, to
encode and retrieve information similarly (or, at least, nondisruptively). Harris and colleagues (2010), however, note
that these results provide empirical justification for the transactive memory (TM) systems approach (cf. Wegner, 1987).
In TM systems, groups of individuals share the burden
of remembering. Although some information is stored only
within the individuals, through communication a successful
group can share and combine information, resulting in grouplevel knowledge that exceeds that of any of its individual
members. In some cases, the pieces of information held by
individual group members can be combined into knowledge
that none of the members individually possessed, and in this
sense, the whole can truly come to be more than the sum of
its parts. According to Wegner, Erber, and Raymond (1991),
these emergent memory systems are more likely to succeed
when group members are familiar with each other (as expertise and role within the group are already known and can be
exploited). Harris et al. (2010; and see Harris, Keil, Sutton,
Barnier, & McIlwain, 2011) found evidence for this kind of
TM system in their study of couples who had been married
for over 20 years. Many of these couples were able to demonstrate collaborative facilitation, but the pattern of results was
complex: facilitation was not stable across couples, tasks,
nor across within-task topics. Similarly, Hollingshead (1998)
found that couples were more likely to form TM systems, but
only under certain communication and task conditions.
A successful TM system can be conceptualized as a special case of the more general coordinative structure framework described by Shockley, Richardson, and Dale (2009).
A coordinative structure is a self-organized, softly assembled
(i.e. temporary), set of components that emerges naturally,
under certain conditions, and behaves as a single unit (see
also Bernstein, 1967). The domain of joint-action is ripe with
examples of how people coordinate to move together, either
in service of a shared goal (Richardson, Marsh, & Baron,
2007), or even unintentionally (Richardson, Marsh, Isenhower, Goodman, & Schmidt, 2007; and see Marsh, Richardson, & Schmidt, 2009). Tollefsen and Dale (2012) point out
that when individuals are engaged in a joint task or joint action, they become aligned at multiple levels, including body

posture (Shockley, Santana, & Fowler, 2003), linguistic form
choice (Pickering & Garrod, 2004), and higher-level cognitive states (Tollefsen & Dale, 2012; Sebanz, Bekkering, &
Knoblich, 2006) and alignment at any of these levels can
“percolate” up to others. Ultimately, we seek to integrate
this dynamic account of interpersonal coordination and collaboration with the substantial body of literature on the social
consequences of memory and collaborative recall.
Here, we take preliminary steps in this direction by examining collaboration on a relatively unconstrained memory
task utilizing trivia-type clues. The trivia clues allow us to
conceptualize the dynamics of remembering as a search process across pre-existing memory space, as participants consider many possible solutions before narrowing down on an
objectively correct answer. Extending the work of Szary and
Dale (2013), the current study presents four rounds of trivia
clues to dyads who work either independently or collaboratively on each round to find solutions. After the game, a
more traditional recall test measures recall for the solutions
achieved during the trivia game.
Results from Szary and Dale (2013) showed that, on average, dyads performed better (answered more clues correctly,
answered them faster, answered them more accurately, and
were more likely to remember them later in a surprise recall task) during collaborative rounds as compared to individual rounds. However, these results did not address the
performance of nominal groups, nor the effects of familiarity on group performance. The current study uses the trivia
paradigm with the primary modification that familiar and
non-familiar dyads were recruited, and results are presented
in terms of the more stringent nominal comparisons. In order to increase the quantity and quality of interactions, the
trivia game was extended to include more clues and provide
more time for each clue. Although our familiarity measure
was extremely limited, we present our encouraging findings
that (1) collaborative inhibition can be eliminated by even a
short period of familiarity; and (2) collaborative facilitation is
stronger for dyads with more familiarity.

relationships in our familiar condition ranged from 2 months
to 3 years (M = 15.59 months, SD = 10.52).

Procedure
Upon arrival, all dyads were given 5 minutes for introducing and familiarizing themselves with one another1 . Partners were seated across from each other at a table with two
HP Chromebook laptops between them, on which the stimuli were presented. The partners could see only their own
workspaces, but were able to observe one another over the
tops of their screens. Each dyad participated in multiple
rounds of a trivia game, working either individually or collaboratively on each round. After all rounds of the trivia task
were finished, the experimenter instructed each participant to
open a blank text file and, working independently, spend 5
minutes recalling and listing as many of the trivia game answers as possible. Finally, a brief post-experimental survey
was performed and participants were dismissed.

Methods
Participants
Participants were recruited from a subject pool of University of California, Merced undergraduate students who participated for course credit. For the non-familiar condition,
two independent timeslots were posted on the SONA research
participation system. For the familiar condition, one timeslot
was posted and each participant was asked to bring a friend.
After the task, participants were surveyed to determine the
extent and nature of their relationship, if any, in order to categorize them into the appropriate conditions. In total, we collected data from 68 participants (46 female; 22 male), with
a mean age of 19.9 (SD = 2.8). Both the familiar and nonfamiliar conditions included 17 dyads (34 participants; 20 females, 14 males in non-familiar; 26 females, 8 males in familiar). Given our lenient recruitment procedure, the length of

Trivia Game The stimuli consisted of 60 trivia clues of
medium-level difficulty (answered correctly about half of the
time) as described in Szary and Dale (2013). The clues represent a variety of types of question: cultural knowledge (“Kill
Bill” star Thurman: UMA); general knowledge (U.S. spy organization: CIA); word definitions (Gift to charity: DONATION); logic (Hour subunits: MINUTES); fill-in-the blank
fails”: ELSE); categories (Tulips and irises, for ex(“If all
ample: FLOWERS); and sayings (“Rolling in dough” meaning: RICH). Examples show the answers in italics.
Clues were presented using a trivia computer game developed by the authors using Adobe Flash CS5. Clues are sorted
into 4 rounds of 15 clues each, and participants are instructed
to complete each round either collaboratively (C), or independently (I). During the collaborative rounds, partners are
encouraged to discuss clues and work together to solve them
as a team. Across dyads, the order of the clues and condition
(which could be either I-C-I-C or C-I-C-I) was randomized
and counterbalanced. Clues were presented one-at-a-time,
along with blank squares corresponding to each letter of the
correct answer. After an answer is typed in, the space-bar is
used to submit the answer. If correct, a checkmark icon appears briefly and the program moves on to the next clue, as
shown in Figure 1. If incorrect, a red “X” marks each incorrect letter, which can then be corrected. Participants may try
as many times as necessary to submit a correct answer, but if
they don’t succeed within 30 seconds, the program displays a
“Time’s Up!” icon and moves on to the next clue.
Between each round, participants are given their new conditions and asked to wait for their partners (if necessary) so
they can move on together. Partners indicated their progress
to each other (“Working”, or “’Ready when you are!”) using

crucial for non-familiar dyads to become comfortable interacting
with one another during the task. This procedure was replicated for
familiar dyads for the purpose of consistency.

nominal aggregate performance in our task, consider stepping through each clue j = [1, ..., 60] for each Di . The performance measures {correct (yes/no); time (ms); errors (#);
recall (yes/no)} for our nominal Di j are calculated as follows:
(Case 1): If both P1i j and P2i j are correct, Di j is also correct.
Time is computed as the smaller (faster) of P1i j and P2i j ,
and errors are computed as the smaller (most accurate) of
P1i j and P2i j . If either P1i j or P2i j is correctly recalled, so is Di j .
(Case 2): If only one of P1i j and P2i j is correct, Di j is correct
and time, errors, and recall are set equal to those of whichever
Pi j was correct.
(Case 3): If neither P1i j nor P2i j is correct, Di j performance is
{no; null; null; no}.

Figure 1: Screenshot from the trivia game, showing a successfully answered clue.

For internal consistency, the same nominal aggregation
procedure was used for both collaborative and independent
rounds (because even during collaboration participants had
their own computers, resulting in two datasets for all rounds).
However, aggregation is expected to play a negligible roll for
the collaborative datasets, as dyads talked and submitted answers together resulting in largely similar datasets. For the
sake of consistency with the literature, we refer to aggregated
collaborating groups as simply “collaborative groups”, while
we refer to the aggregated (hypothetical) groups computed
from independent rounds as “nominal groups”. We then compute a difference measure as collaborative minus nominal
group performance (or the reverse, for our reverse measures
of speed and accuracy). Thus, performance difference > 0 always indicates collaborative facilitation, while performance
difference < 0 indicates collaborative inhibition.

flip cards placed on the table beside their computers. For each
clue the program recorded whether a correct answer was submitted before time ran out and, if so, the elapsed time before
the answer was submitted, as well as the number of incorrect
attempts preceeding each correct answer.
Post-experimental Survey After the trivia game and recall
task, participants were asked to privately rate their team’s effectiveness when working together. Ratings were performed
on a 1-7 scale where 1 represented “not at all effective” and 7
represented “perfectly effective”. Participants were also surveyed to determine whether they knew each other before the
experiment or not and, if so, the length of their relationship.

Data Analysis

Discrepancy Lastly, we compute a discrepancy measure
for each dyad that indicates how similar or dissimilar its
members are to each other. This measure is computed as the
magnitude of the difference between each dyad member’s average performance during the (two) individual rounds.

The current study used a 2 (familiar or non-familiar; a
between-dyad manipulation) x 2 (collaborative or individual
solving; a within-dyad manipulation) mixed design. Our dependent variables included (1) the number of correct answers
achieved; (2) speed, measured as the amount of time in milliseconds that elapsed before each correct answer was submitted; (3) the number of errors (incorrect submission attempts)
that preceded each correctly submitted answer; and (4) the
number of correct answers recalled (that is, during the subsequent recall task).

Results
Performance

Nominal Aggregation Because both participants used their
own computer workstations to submit answers, we have two
unique datasets for each dyad. Here, we combine individual members’ performances into one group-level dataset (per
dyad). That is, for each dyad Di=[1,...,n] (where n is the number of dyads) we compute the dataset Di as the combination of
both its participants’ datasets (P1i and P2i ). Consistent with the
literature on collaborative recall, we combine unique datasets
into one using an extension of nominal aggregation to compute nominal performance (which is the hypothetical, optimal
combination of P1i and P2i ). To illustrate how we calculated

Across conditions, nominal groups performed significantly
better than collaborative groups on two performance measures (number correct and speed), indicative of collaborative
inhibition (details for all performance measures are given in
Table 1). However, nominal groups performed significantly
worse on the other two measures (minimization of errors
and number recalled), indicative of collaborative facilitation.
Non-familiar dyads displayed a similar pattern of results,
showing significant indications of collaborative inhibition in
terms of number correct and speed, but only showed collaborative facilitation in terms of minimization of errors (and not
number recalled). Conversely, familiarity was found to ameliorate the negative consequences of collaboration. Within
familiar dyads, nominal and collaborative groups were not

Recall By Round We replicated previous findings (Szary
& Dale, 2013) that dyads remember more from rounds on
which they collaborated, and in general recall more from the
later (more recent) rounds. This first result is presented in
Table 1, which shows that the number of items recalled was
higher during collaborative rounds across all dyads, as well
as for familiar dyads, but not for non-familiar dyads. When
comparing items recalled from each of the four rounds separately, it is apparent that this difference manifests largely
in the superior fourth round performance of familiar collaborator groups. Table 2 shows the average number of
items recalled from each round. There are no significant
differences between any of the comparisons (familiar–nonfamiliar; nominal–collaborative; or any of the other 2x2 comparisons) in any round except round 4, where familiar collab-

significantly different from one another in terms of number
correct or speed, but collaborative groups were (still) significantly better at minimizing errors and at subsequent recall,
indicating collaborative facilitation. Unpaired t-tests between
performance metrics for familiar and non-familiar dyads did
not reach significance. The discrepancy measure for each
dyad was weakly, negatively correlated with the dyad’s collaborative performance, but this also failed to reach significance. Still, when the individuals composing a dyad performed more similarly during individual rounds, their collaboration tended to be more successful (Figure 2).

orator groups recall significantly more than familiar nominal
groups (unpaired t(15) = 2.26, p < 0.05). Figure 3 plots the
data from Table 2 to further illustrate this effect.

Qualitative Measures of Familiarity
Length of Relationship A preliminary analysis of the effect of relationship lengths on performance was computed
for the number of correct answers achieved. Figure 4 shows
the performance difference for number of answers achieved
(from Table 1) as a function of each dyad’s relationship
length. Across all dyads, the difference measure is positively
correlated with length of relationship, r(32) = 0.42, p < 0.05.
That is, collaborative facilitation is greater for dyads who
knew each other longer. This trend remains but is no longer
significant when considering only familiar dyads. The existence of a subtle but noteworthy length-of-relationship effect
can be further demonstrated by grouping dyads by the length
of their relationships.
As shown in Table 1, dyads with no relationship (rellength =
0) exhibited a performance difference of −1.18 (SD = 1.24),
indicative of significant collaborative inhibition. Familiar
dyads exhibited a performance difference of −0.29 (SD =
1.29), indicative of weaker collaborative inhibition. Among
the 9 familiar dyads with self-reported relationship lengths
of 12 months or less (rellength ≤ 12; M = 7.67 months, SD =
4.30), a performance difference of −0.89 (SD = 1.47), indicating even weaker collaborative inhibition, was observed.
For the 8 dyads with longer relationships (rellength > 12),
M = 24.5 months, SD = 7.76), there was a performance difference of 0.34 (SD = 0.57), indicating collaborative facilitation. Overall, more familiar dyads were more likely to experience facilitatory effects of collaboration. This distinction was
reliable for rellength > 12 as compared to: (1) rellength ≤ 12
(unpaired t(15) = 2.27, p < 0.05); (2) rellength = 0 (unpaired
t(23) = 3.35, p < 0.005); and (3) both rellength ≤ 12 and
rellength = 0 together (unpaired t(32) = 3.04, p < 0.005).

lected individually for each participant. The mean of collaborative effectiveness ratings was 5.91 (SD = 0.84). Dyad level
aggregates were computed as the sums of their component
members’ ratings, in order to look for a relationship between
reported effectiveness and actual task performance. None was
found: self-reports of effectiveness did not differ as a function
of actual effectiveness (as measured by performance metrics),
nor as a function of task condition.

General Discussion
The current paper builds upon the methods and results of
Szary and Dale (2013) by considering the role of familiarity and reporting nominal group performance. While collaborative inhibition is observed, which is consistent with much
of the collaborative recall literature, it is observed only for
certain performance measures and for certain dyads. That
is, across all dyads a significant collaborative inhibition is
observed in terms of the number of trivia clues correctly
answered, and the speed of achieving those answers. This
significant inhibition remains for non-familiar dyads, but no
difference is observed between collaborative and nominal
groups who are familiar to one another. Familiarity, in this
case, has protected against the negative consequences so often observed in the social remembering literature. In fact,
we demonstrate here a number of instances in which collaborative facilitation can actually be observed for a memory
task. For example, dyads made less errors during collaborative rounds, and recalled more from the rounds on which they
collaborated. This effect is even stronger for the subgroup of
familiar dyads.
Despite the poverty of our familiarity measure, we uncovered a correlation between relationship length and collaborative facilitation. On most measures we were able to confirm
that familiar dyads worked better together (consistent with
Wegner et al., 1991; Harris et al., 2010, as discussed ear-

lier). Additionally, we found that similarity between two participants was associated with their success as a dyad. This
is consistent with existing work on joint decision-making,
which shows that collaboration on low-level perception tasks
is more successful when dyads are composed of members
with similar perceptual abilities, and when those members use
similar task-relevant linguistic forms (Fusaroli et al., 2012).
More than any single conclusion, this collection of results
suggests that collaborative remembering is a complex task,
the success of which is modulated by many interacting factors (familiarity, similarity) and changing components (different knowledge landscapes for each clue, different external contexts across rounds). It is perhaps most appropriately
approached from the dynamic, joint-action perspective of a
coordinative structure, as described earlier. Ongoing work
seeks to investigate these data from this perspective, which
will involve utilizing complex dynamics methods to uncover
the mechanisms involved with what often feels, informally,
like a qualitative shift from the paradigm of successful collaboration (which captures, for example, the concepts of TM
and instances of collaborative facilitation) to the paradigm of
unsuccessful collaboration (captured by collaborative inhibition and retrieval disruption, for example). See Richardson,
Dale, and Marsh (2014) for a treatment of these methodologies and their theoretical implications.
