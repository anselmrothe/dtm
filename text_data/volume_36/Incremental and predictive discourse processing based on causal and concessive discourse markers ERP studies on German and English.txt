Abstract
There is some evidence for both the hypothesis that discourse
connectors facilitate text comprehension and the hypothesis
that processing discourse connectors is highly incremental.
Less, however, is known about the way in which different
discourse connectors help comprehension and whether they
can elicit predictions of upcoming contents. In the present
ERP studies on German and English we investigated the
effect of congruency and connector type (causal / concessive)
on the prediction of a target referent (2x2 design). We found a
fronto-central positivity for the concessive connector
compared to the causal condition and an N400-like effect for
the target noun phrase for incongruent compared to congruent
conditions. Our results suggest an effect of context-updating
at the connector (frontal positivity) and provide evidence for
prediction of upcoming content based on the discourse
connector.

Introduction
Discourse connectors (such as therefore, however, instead)
have been shown to facilitate comprehension, at least when
used appropriately (e.g., Millis & Just, 1994). It is, however,
less clear in which way different types of discourse
connectors help processing and, in particular, whether they
elicit predictions of upcoming linguistic material. Existing
work on the processing of discourse relations revealed that
discourse connectors are rapidly and incrementally
integrated with earlier parts of the discourse (e.g., Traxler et
al., 1997). Previous research on the processing of discourse
relations also suggests that people have some general
cognitive biases when processing text, which lead them to
more easily infer causal and continuous than, for instance,
concessive discourse relations (Murray, 1995; Sanders,
2005; Brehm, 2005). Of particular relevance here is an ERP
study by Kuperberg et al. (2011), who found evidence for a
default to interpret adjacent sentences as standing in a causal
relationship: causally unrelated scenarios induced a larger
N400 than intermediately related scenarios which, in turn,

elicited a larger N400 than causally related scenarios. The
view that causal and continuous discourse relations are
generally expected by comprehenders is also consistent with
recent analyses of discourse relation marking in production
data: Asr & Demberg (2012) find that causal and continuous
discourse relations are less likely to be marked using
explicit discourse connectors than other (presumably less
expected) discourse relations. This observation is in
accordance with the uniform information density hypothesis
(Levy & Jaeger, 2007), which holds that optional linguistic
elements (like discourse connectors) may be omitted when
they do not convey much new information, i.e. when they
mark an expected discourse relation. Taken together, these
findings lead to the prediction that discourse connectors
which signal discontinuity should be more difficult to
process because they require a re-interpretation of the
discourse relation that was assumed by default.
In the present ERP studies on German and English, we
compare the processing of causal versus concessive
discourse connectors. Concessive discourse connectors
represent an interesting comparison to causal connectors
from a theoretical perspective, as they have been argued to
represent the same type of relation but to differ in polarity
(Louwerse, 2001; Sanders et al., 1992), and have sometimes
been referred to as “negative causals” (König & Siemund,
2000). Previous work comparing the processing of causals
and concessives in the visual world paradigm (Köhne &
Demberg, 2013) showed that both causal and concessive
discourse markers can be rapidly integrated into on-line
comprehension and that processing the concessive leads to a
search for alternatives. While the visual world paradigm is
useful in revealing predictions during sentence
comprehension through visual attention, it does not give
much insight into the underlying processes. Köhne and
Demberg’s experiment using eye-movements in reading
additionally indicates highly incremental processing and
prediction in causals. However, no evidence for incremental
processing and rapid integration was found for concessives.
The authors hypothesize that their results may be due to an
increased difficulty of processing concessives, or of
integrating them with upcoming content.

403

The present ERP studies aim to complement these earlier
studies by examining a) whether processing concessives is
more difficult than processing causals and b) whether
readers also predict upcoming linguistic content without the
support of a visual scene, both in causal and concessive
discourses. Two ERP components are particularly relevant
for the present studies: the N400 and a late positive
component (P600). The N400, a broadly distributed
negative deflection peaking around 400ms post-stimulus
onset was initially observed in response to sentence-final
semantically incongruent words, but was soon discovered to
be part of the normal response to words and other
potentially meaningful stimuli (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011).
Importantly, the N400 amplitude is sensitive to the
predictability of a word in its sentential (e.g., Kutas &
Hillyard, 1984) or discourse (e.g., van Berkum et al., 2005)
context, with less expected words eliciting larger N400s
than more expected words.
The P600, a late positive component with a latency
varying between 600 and 900ms, has been traditionally
associated with syntactic reanalysis and repair processes
(e.g. Osterhout and Holcomb, 1992). More recently,
however, late positivities – rather than N400 effects – have
been reported to semantic/pragmatic violations (e.g., van
Herten et al., 2005; Kuperberg et al., 2003; Drenhaus et al.,
2011). Interestingly, the “semantic P600” has been
discussed as reflecting the re-organization or updating of the
mental representation of the unfolding discourse (Brouwer
et al., 2012).

Experiment 1: German
Materials
In the present ERP study on German, we investigated the
effect of discourse connector type (causal / concessive) and
congruency (congruent/incongruent) on predicting a target
referent (2x2 design), see Example (1).
1.

Tim und Kim überlegen, ob sie lieber tanzen gehen oder
den neuen Film sehen wollen. Kim findet tanzen toll.
Daher/Dennoch gehen sie in die[fem] frisch renovierte
Disko/das[neut] frisch renovierte Kino, um sich richtig
gut zu amüsieren.
’Tim and Kim wonder whether they prefer to go dancing
or to watch the new movie. Kim likes dancing a lot.
Therefore/Nevertheless, they go to the[fem/neut] newly
renovated disco/cinema to enjoy themselves.’

Our stimuli consisted of three-sentence discourses (two
context sentences and one target sentence). The first
sentence always introduced two alternatives (e.g., going
dancing vs. watching a film), the second sentence then
identified a preference for one of them (going dancing). The
third sentence (i.e., the target sentence) began either with a
causal (deswegen/daher 'therefore') or a concessive
connector (trotzdem/dennoch 'however') and included the
gender-marked pre-nominal region with an article and an

adjective (die frisch renovierte/das frisch renovierte, 'the
newly renovated[fem/neut]'), preceding the target noun (Disko
‘night club’/Kino ‘cinema’).
We hypothesized that the second sentence together with
the discourse marker would elicit predictions about the
target noun (e.g. Kim likes dancing + Therefore  night
club). Therefore, there should be a mismatch effect (i.e., a
larger N400) in both the causal and the concessive condition
when the gender of the article in the pre-nominal region
does not match the gender of the predicted noun (i.e., in the
incongruent condition). Under the assumption that people
by default expect causal relations, we further predict a
positivity on the concessive connector compared to the
causal one, reflecting a discourse model updating process
(Brouwer et al. 2012).
Participants
16 undergraduate students (mean age 23, 6 male) from
Saarland University participated in this experiment. All
participants were native speakers of German and had normal
or corrected-to-normal vision. All participants were paid for
their participation.

Materials and Procedure
We constructed 96 experimental items (24 per condition, see
Examples 1a-d) and 72 unrelated fillers. For the presentation
of the stimuli we used the E-prime software (Psychology
Software Tools, Inc.). During the experiment, each
participant was seated in a sound-proof, electromagnetically shielded chamber. Sentences were presented in
black fonts (28-point Times) on a white background.
After a short training session (6 sentences), the 96
experimental items and the 72 fillers were presented in
pseudo-randomized order, in 4 blocks with intervening
breaks. Each item (and filler) started with two context
sentences, which were presented as a whole for 2500ms,
followed by a blank screen (150ms), and a fixation star in
the center of the screen (500ms). The target sentence was
then presented word-by-word in the center of the screen, for
350ms plus 100ms inter-stimulus interval (RSVP).
In 25% of the cases, the target sentence was followed by a
plausibility judgment task: participants were asked to press
one of two buttons on a response pad within a maximal
interval of 2500ms. The EEG was recorded by means of 26
Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes. Electrodes were placed according
to the 10-20 system (Sharbrough et al., 1995). Impedances
were kept below 5kOhm. The signal was referenced and
digitized at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. The EEG row data
were re-referenced to an average of both mastoid electrodes
offline. The horizontal electro-oculogram (EOG) was
monitored with two electrodes placed at the outer canthus of
each eye and the vertical EOG with two electrodes above
and below the right eye.
During recording, no on-line filters were used. The EEG
data were band-pass filtered offline with 0.1-40Hz. Singleparticipant averages were computed in a 1000ms window
per condition relative to the onset of the critical item and

aligned to a 200ms pre-stimulus baseline and semiautomatically screened off-line for electrode drifts, amplifier
blocking, eye movements, muscle artifacts (4% of data
points were excluded). Only artifact-free ERP averages
time-locked to the onset of the critical regions entered the
analyses (boldfaced in 1a-1d). In our analyses, we compared
the critical connector region (causal versus concessive) and
each word in the following NP (das/die frisch renovierte
Kino/Disko).

any interference with experimental effects. The analysis
revealed no significant effects in either experiment (t < 1).
Separate analyses of frontal (F3, FZ, F4), central (C3, CZ,
C4), and posterior (P3, PZ, P4) electrode regions of interest
(ROIs) revealed a significant effect for the frontal ROI
(coefficient = 1.5645, SE = 0.4123, t = 3.795) and the
central ROI (coefficient = 1.1817, SE = 0.3510, t = 3.367)
but not at the posterior ROI (t < 1).

Descriptive results (connector)
The ERP patterns to the connectors are displayed in Figs. 1.
The concessive connector elicited a larger fronto-central
positivity than the causal connector between 400 and 700
ms

Neither visual inspection nor statistical analyses revealed a
significant effect at the determiner or the noun. However, at
the adjective region (between 350 and 500ms), the
incongruent condition elicited a more negative-going ERP
than the congruent condition following a causal connector
as well as a concessive connector (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3).

Statistical analyses (connector)
We fitted linear mixed models (LMM) (Bates & Sarkar,
2007) with ERP values averaged over critical items for each
participant as dependent measure. The fixed factor was the
connector type (causal versus concessive). Participants were
used as a random factor. Additionally, separate slope terms
for participants and connector types were used (the so-called
random intercepts and slopes model; Gelman & Hill, 2007).
The fronto-centrally distributed positivity in the 400–700ms
time-window described above was reliable: The LMM
analysis, collapsing over the nine channels (F3, FZ, F4, C3,
CZ, C4, P3, PZ, P4), revealed a significant difference
(coefficient = 1.2924, SE = 0.3146, t
= 4.109).1
Additionally, we performed baseline analyses for the
window 200 to 0ms relative to the onset of the critical word
in all reported experiments to make sure that no systematic
effects were present prior to presentation of the stimulus (t <
1

Following Baayen et al. (2008), t values larger than 2 or
smaller than -2 indicate significance at the level of 5%.

Statistical analyses (adjectival region)
We fitted linear mixed models (LMM) with ERP values
averaged over critical items for each participant as the
dependent measure. Fixed factors were connector type
(causal vs. concessive) and congruency (congruent vs.
incongruent). Participants were treated as a random factor
and also had a separate slope term for connector type
(contrast coding: -0.5 for the concessive condition and +0.5
for the causal condition) and congruency (contrast coding: 0.5 for the incongruent condition, and +0.5 for the gendermatching condition). Statistical analyses revealed a more
frontally distributed negativity following the causal
connector and a more fronto-centrally distributed negativity
following the concessive connector for the incongruent
condition compared to the congruent condition (Fig. 2 and
Fig. 3).
The LMM analysis, collapsing over the nine channels
(F3, FZ, F4, C3, CZ, C4, P3, PZ, P4), showed a significant

effect of congruency (coefficient = -0.4690, SE = 0.2023, t =
-2.318) but not of connector type (t < 1). Separate analyses
of frontal, central, and posterior electrode ROIs (regions of
interest) showed a significant effect of congruency at the
frontal ROI (coefficient = -0.9222, SE = 0.3709, t = -2.486)
but no effect of connector type (t < 1). No overall effects for
connector type or congruency were found at the central (t <
1) or posterior (t < 1) ROIs.2

Discussion
The ERP analyses revealed a significant fronto-central
positivity for processing the concessive connector compared
to processing the causal one. This can be interpreted as an
effect of context-updating from the expected causal
discourse relation to the concessive discourse relation (see
general discussion), in line with our predictions.
We furthermore found a frontal N400-like effect on the
pre-nominal region for the incongruent compared to the
congruent conditions, for both the causal and the concessive
conditions. This effect is consistent with the anticipatory
looks to target referents during the pre-target region
observed in Köhne & Demberg's (2013) visual world study
using a similar manipulation. The negativity found on the
adjectival region supports the view that participants
predicted a very specific lexical item and reacted to the
incongruency of that lexical item with the gender-marking
of the pre-nominal region.3

condition. The scalp distribution of the effect (concessive
minus causal) is plotted on the right side.

Experiment 2: English
Materials
In the English version of this study (see Example 2), the
nominal target region contained a noun with vocal vs.
consonantal onset. Accordingly, the pre-nominal region
contained the determiner 'an' or 'a'. Similar to gendermarking in the German experiment, the pre-nominal
determiner was used to test for congruency effects based on
people’s prediction for the target noun.

A separate analysis of the adjective region only in the

causal connector condition (frontal: coefficient = -1.0276, SE =

Statistical analyses (NP)
The statistical analyses were performed in the same way as
mentioned before for the German adjectival region. The
LMM analysis, collapsing over the nine channels (F3, FZ,
F4, C3, CZ, C4, P3, PZ, P4), showed a significant effect of
congruency (coefficient = -1.0118, SE = 0.4120, t = -2.456)
but not of connector type (t < 1). A separate analysis of
frontal, central, and posterior electrode ROIs showed
significant effects of congruency at the frontal electrodes
(coefficient = -1.0118, SE = 0.4120, t = -2.456), central
electrodes (coefficient = -1.1921, SE = 0.4288, t = -2.780)
and posterior electrodes (coefficient = -1.2292, SE = 0.5440,
t = -2.260). No effects of connector type were found (t < 1).4

Statistical analyses (connector)
The statistical analyses were performed in the same way as
for the German experiment (400–700ms time-window). The
LMM analysis, collapsing over the nine channels (F3, FZ,
F4, C3, CZ, C4, P3, PZ, P4), revealed a significant
positivity (coefficient = 1.1327, SE = 0.2565, t = 4.416) for
the concessive connector compared to the causal connector.
A separate analysis of frontal (F3, FZ, F4), central (C3,
CZ, C4), and posterior (P3, PZ, P4) electrode ROIs revealed
a significant effect for the frontal (coefficient = 1.6009, SE =
0.4867, t = 3.29), central (coefficient = 0.9133, SE= 0.4299,
t = 2.125) and the posterior ROI (coefficient = 0.8839, SE =
0.3995, t = 2.212).

Discussion
The ERP analyses revealed a significant positivity for the
concessive connector compared to the causal one,
suggesting a model-updating effect, in line with the first
experiment on German.
We furthermore found an N400-like effect on the noun
region for the incongruent compared to the congruent
condition, for both the causal and the concessive conditions,
showing that participants incrementally integrated discourse
context and connector with upcoming content. We did not
find any significant effect on the pre-nominal determiner.
While this is consistent with the first experiment, in which
we only found the mismatch effect on the adjectival region
but not on the determiner, our results in the English
experiment remain inconclusive as to whether the
incongruency effect reflects active prediction or rather
integration of the noun into the preceding context.

General Discussion
In two studies using German and English as test language
we investigated the processing of causal versus concessive
discourse connectors and the joint influence of context and
these connectors on the predictability of a target noun.
Our experimental manipulations elicited late positivities on
the concessive connector compared to the causal connector
in both studies (German and English).
Brouwer et al. (2012) argued that the P600 component is a
family of late positivities that reflect several sub-processes
involved in the re-organization or updating of the mental
representation of what is being communicated (e.g.,
accommodating new discourse referents, assigning thematic
roles, establishing or revising already established relations
between entities, etc.). Furthermore, Van Petten & Luka
(2012) speculate that while more posteriorly distributed

Separate analyses for the causal condition and the concessive
condition only showed effects at the frontal (coefficient = -1.7943,
SE 0.6582, t = -2.726), central (coefficient = -2.2961, SE 0.6103, t
= -2.7628) and posterior (coefficient = -1.9742, se 0.5846, t = 2.377) electrodes for the causal connector condition and an effect
at the frontal (coefficient, =-1.6806, SE 0.6182, t = -2.034)
electrodes but no effects for central (t < 1) or posterior (t < 1)
electrodes for the concessive connector condition.

positivities reflect re-processing cost, more frontally
pronounced positivities might reflect the cost for
disconfirmed predictions or prediction errors. Following this
logic, the frontally pronounced positivities at the connectors
in our experiments may reflect an updating process
triggered by a predicted but disconfirmed causal relation.
The N400-like effects at the adjective (German experiment)
and the noun (English experiment) suggest that discourse
relations are rapidly used to predict (and integrate)
upcoming content. In particular, the German data provide
strong evidence that the target noun was pre-activated, as
the effect was found in the pre-nominal region, a result
consistent with previous findings (e.g., DeLong et al., 2005;
van Berkum et al., 2005). The English data provide further
evidence that discourse relations are processed
incrementally and help at least integrating upcoming
content.

Conclusions
In two experiments, we found evidence for the hypothesis
that an unexpected discourse connector leads to an updating
process (late positivity). An N400-like effect on the prenominal region in the German experiment furthermore
indicates that the processing of discourse connectors elicits
predictions of upcoming content. Taken together, these
results support a view in which discourse markers help
comprehenders to anticipate and integrate upcoming words.
