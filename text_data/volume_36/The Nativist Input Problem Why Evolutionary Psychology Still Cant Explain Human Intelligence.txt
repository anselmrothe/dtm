version of nativism. It is fair to say that few Evolutionary
Psychologists adhere to such an unreasonable view of
nativism now. However, I find it instructional to start with
the argument against the strongest version of Evolutionary
Psychology (Section 4) and modify the argument to address
the more moderate and reasonable ones (Section 5), and it is
the strategy this paper will follow.
   In sum, evolutionary psychologists conceive of human
mind as composed exclusively of Darwinian modules, that
is, innate and informationally encapsulated computational
mechanisms that are designed to solve some limited range
of adaptive problems.

   Here is where some recent models of evolutionary
