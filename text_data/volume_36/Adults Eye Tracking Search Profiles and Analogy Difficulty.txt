   Each trial was composed of eight words written in black
ink on a white background, corresponding to the A, B, and
C terms of the analogical problems, and five potential
solutions. The solution set was composed of the Target (T),
two related-to-C distractors (SemDis), and two unrelated
distractors (UnDis). Each word was presented in a black
frame (220x220 pixels). The A, B and C terms were

empty black frame (for the picked up stimulus), and the 5
words composing the solution set were displayed in a row at

Stimulus (A, B, C, T, SemDis, UnDis), Condition (Easy,
Difficult) and Slice (first, middle, and last) as within-subject
factors, was used to assess the temporal dynamics of rates of
fixations on the distractors and the source domain (Figure
