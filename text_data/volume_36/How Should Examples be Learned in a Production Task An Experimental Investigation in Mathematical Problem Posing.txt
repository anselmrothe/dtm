D/I problem posed in the solving group
 A teacher planned to divide students into groups of equal
 numbers of students. If 5 students were assigned to each
 group, then 2 students were left. If 6 students were
 assigned to each group, then 4 additional students were
 needed. How many groups did the teacher want to make?
 Solution.
 Let x denote the number of groups.
       5x + 2 = 6x − 4
 x = 6.

 percent is discounted from the price of a loaf, 284 yen is
 left after buying 8 loaves. Find the price of a loaf.
 Solution.
