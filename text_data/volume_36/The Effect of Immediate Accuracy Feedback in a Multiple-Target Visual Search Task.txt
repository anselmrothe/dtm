Data Analysis
Our analysis only included the correct trials in which
participants found the five targets. This was decided because
trials with responses within less than five targets might add
noise to the analysis.
   The responses were identified as either a hit or a miss
based on the eye fixation made during the button press.
Participants were trained to look at the item that they
identified as a target while they pressed the key on the
keyboard. Some fixations landed on the blank area rather
than on any search item. When this happened, we assumed             Figure 2. Search duration between two correct target

confound, we compared the gaze duration on a target when
subjects made a response between both conditions. The
results show that the average gaze duration when fixating on
a target while making a response was similar between the
two conditions. The average gaze duration for all
participants was 700 ms for auditory feedback and 680 ms
for the neutral sound, which was not a statistically
significant difference, t(10) = 1.02, p > 0.1. This implies
that the better search efficiency we found (see Fig. 2) was
not due to the longer planning time but some other cognitive
factors.
  Since the better performance evidently did not result from
the longer fixation duration on target items, it is possible
