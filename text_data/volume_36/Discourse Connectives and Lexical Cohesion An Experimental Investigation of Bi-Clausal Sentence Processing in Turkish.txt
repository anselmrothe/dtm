per word. The total number of recalled discourse
connectives and the total number of discourse connectives
were removed from the analysis in order to compare groups.
The following formula was used:
   [(sum of words in target sentences) – (sum of discourse
connectives in target sentences)]
   [(sum of recalled words in target sentences) – (sum of recalled
discourse connectives in target sentences)]

   The number of single fixations in the sentences was
counted and the result was divided by the number of total
words in sentences. This is called fixation count per word

data were used.
Effect of coherence on comprehension
The t-test results of recall showed that there was a
significant effect of coherence, t(39)=2.71, p=.01; the words
in the HCoh group (M=0.85; S.D.=0.06) were better
recalled than those in the LCoh group (M=0.75; S.D=0.13).
The results are represented in a graph in Figure 1. We used
