   Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder characterized
by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, catatonia,
paranoia, keen interest in religion, emotional flattening, and
creativity. Hallucinations may take the form of verbal
running commentary, or multiple voices conversing with
each other. There is evidence that neural connections that
predispose one to schizophrenia contribute to creativity
(Cropley & Sikand, 1973). Genes that affect the dorsolateral
prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices differently individuals
with schizophrenia exhibit positive selection for differential
expression between humans and chimpanzees (Morgan,
2013). Moreover, a polymorphism in FOXP2 can cause
language deficits in patients with schizophrenia, suggesting
that increased risk of schizophrenia is the price Homo
sapiens pay for language and creativity (Sanjuan, Tolosa,
Dagnall, Molto, & de Frutos, 2010). Moreover,
schizophrenia is sometimes associated with both language
impairment and above-average creativity (Kuttner Lorincz,
& Swan, 1967). These findings suggest that the creative
explosion of the Middle-Upper Paleolithic including the
onset of complex language may have indirectly selected for
