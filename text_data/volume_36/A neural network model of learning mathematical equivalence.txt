Architecture, Learning, and Aggregation Over
Replications
The architecture of this model is shown in Figure 1. The ovals
represent pools of units and the arrows represent weights con-
necting every unit in one pool to every unit in the other pool.
The strength of the net input to each unit (plus a fixed bias
of -2) determines its activation according to a nonlinear (sig-
moidal) function. The weights were initialized to small ran-
dom values. The model is fully recurrent, and so activation
propagated through the model gradually over seven time in-
tervals, divided into sub-intervals or ticks to approximate con-
tinuty (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, 1996).
The units in all but the prompted slot were clamped to the
specified input values for three intervals, during which ac-
tivation propagates to other units. There were four inter-
