Abstract

Numerous comparative studies between bilingual and
monolingual first language learners have pointed to both similarities and differences in the way these two populations
learn language. With respect to vocabulary size, bilinguals
and monolinguals appear to learn new concepts at approximately the same rate (Hoff et al., 2012; De Houwer, Bornstein, & Putnick, 2013) and they also show similar capacities for mapping words to objects in the learning environment
(Byers-Heinlein & Werker, 2013; Werker, Byers-Heinlein, &
Fennell, 2009). However, bilinguals and monolinguals differ in the way they perceive words (Ramon-Casas, Swingley, Sebastián-Gallés, & Bosch, 2009; Byers-Heinlein &
Werker, 2013) and in their usage of mutual exclusivity to disambiguate word referents (Byers-Heinlein & Werker, 2009;
Houston-Price, Caloghiris, & Raviglione, 2010). In particular, bilingual infants tend to show either less reliance on mutual exclusivity or slower development of its use during early
word learning. Furthermore, these differences in the language
environment appear to induce more general cognitive differences (Kovács & Mehler, 2009), which may persist across the
lifespan (Bialystok, Craik, Klein, & Viswanathan, 2004).

Infants learning words in a bilingual language environment
face a number of difficulties that may alter the number and
kinds of words learned early in life. The research described
here investigates several aspects of word learning that may differ between bilinguals and monolinguals. Using a dataset of
353 infants between the ages of 6 months and 7 years old, approximately half of which are bilingual, we examined three
aspects of early word learning: 1) the rate of word learning, 2)
the comparative structure of the English semantic network for
monolingual and bilingual language learners and 3) how word
acquisition in one language is affected by the other in bilingual
children. Our results suggest that bilingual language learning
follows the same pattern of acquisition as monolingual language learning in almost every respect but one. Though a
model of language acquisition for monolingual children is a
good predictor of bilingual acquisition, simulations based on
this model under-predicts bilingual translational equivalents
for many bilingual children. This suggests that learning a word
in one language may facilitate its acquisition in a second language.

Introduction
Children around the world commonly learn more than one
language at birth. Unfortunately, we have a limited understanding of how bilingual first language acquisition (BF)
and monolingual first language acquisition differ because the
dominant share of research on early language acquisition has
focused on monolinguals. Though various theoretical positions have suggested that bilingual first language acquisition
is akin to learning two languages independently or to learning
a single undifferentiated language (Genesee, 2009), investigations of the statistical structure of learned words as well as
the application of formal models of word learning have yet
to be applied. Here, we investigate the statistical structure of
word semantics in the early lexicon of 353 monolingual and
bilingual children and ask to what extent the order of word
acquisition among these two populations fits a recently developed model of early word learning. Thus, we aim to answer
the following question: Do the associative relations between
words in English first language acquisition differ if children
simultaneously learn a second language?

The above findings suggest that though concept learning
rates may be similar among bilinguals and monolinguals, the
patterns of word acquisition may be unique, with the simultaneous learning of two languages influencing the relative order
in which words across languages are learned. There are several specific reasons why this may be true. Firstly, via the mutual exclusivity principle (Markman & Wachtel, 1988) (see
also the principle of contrast (Clark, 2009)), whereby words
acquire their meaning via their relationship with other words
in the language environment (Hills, 2012; Mather & Plunkett,
2010). However, bilingual children appear to relax this principle in order to acquire multiple words for the same object
(Byers-Heinlein & Werker, 2009) and this may make learning
new, semantically different words more difficult when a few
words are already known. Secondly, two sets of labels for
objects in the world provides the infant with a plausible alternative to learning two names–since producing one name is
potentially sufficient to communicate the object of reference.

200

Indeed, bilingual infants code-mix, producing words from a
non-target language when they do not know the appropriate
word in the target language (Genesee, Nicoladis, & Paradis,
1995; Deuchar & Quay, 1999) and this may inhibit the learning of translational equivalents. Thirdly, since only one language can be spoken at a time, early language learning may
be situation specific (we take a bath in English and eat breakfast in Spanish), and thus limit the infants ability to learn one
languages referents across situations. Finally, though we do
not yet understand the causal pathway, late talkers show a different pattern of word learning than typical talkers, one that
is marked not only by slower acquisition but also by different semantic relationships between words (Beckage, Smith,
& Hills, 2011). Within a language, bilinguals show a similar
slower acquisition rate and this may similarly be related to
preferences for learning certain words over others.

in Spanish to be learned (via mutual exclusion), but inhibits
semantically similar words in English. The result is that the
languages should show language specific semantic clustering
if there is inhibition. Recent evidence indicates that children
as young as 18 months show semantic priming, indicating
that children’s earliest lexicons could show a semantic influence between words (Arias-Trejo & Plunkett, 2013; Willits,
Wojcik, Seidenberg, & Saffran, 2013). The final possibility
is that no such influence between languages exists, or that the
first and second possibilities cancel in such a way that there
is no discernible effect.
If either of the two former cases is an appropriate description of the processes underlying bilingual language acquisition, then the semantic network structure of bilingual infants earliest words should differ from those in the monolingual population. In particular, if the two languages influence
one another, then the properties of translational equivalents
should differ between bilinguals and corresponding translational equivalents (that is concepts that are in the productive
vocabulary of both languages) taken from random pairings
of appropriate control lexicons. Second, because English is
a language common to all of our participants, we can compare the associative structure of the English network among
monolinguals and bilinguals to ask if these networks show
greater or lesser semantic similarity–indicating an influence
of exposure to two languages.

In the current article we use network analyses to understand how the semantic knowledge of two languages may
influence the order of early word learning. Network analyses have been used successfully to understand semantic relationships in monolingual language acquisition (Hills, 2012;
Beckage et al., 2011) as well as within languages more generally (Serrano, Flammini, & Menczer, 2009; Arbesman,
Strogatz, & Vitevitch, 2010). A network can be constructed from language by allowing words to be nodes and
connections between words (i.e., edges) to be based on
specific relationship between words (e.g., features (Hills,
Maouene, Maouene, Sheya, & Smith, 2009a), co-occurrences
in text (Hills, Maouene, Riordan, & Smith, 2010), phonological neighbors (Vitevitch, 2008) or free association norms
(Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005)). These relationships allow
one to formally describe a statistical relationship between
words and to use these as predictors for when and how words
will be added into a childs lexicon. As an example, (Hills
et al., 2010), showed the statistical structure of child-directed
speech could predict how childrens early semantic networks
grew over a period of approximately 10 months between 15
and 25 months of age. Moreover, the formal description of
this model (called preferential acquisition) was a better predictor of word learning than a model based on the structure
of known words (the more commonly known preferential attachment).

Method
The words that a child can produce by a specific age were
taken from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) (Dale & Fenson, 1996). The data
consists of 606 children across 10 separate spoken languages,
with 888 recorded entries (since some children were recorded
more than once at different ages). Of these entries, 486 were
monolingual children (that is children whose parents speak
the same language), 331 were bilingual children (that is children whose parents speak different languages), and the rest
were trilingual children or not recorded. After removing incomplete data, we were left with 467 monolingual entries (of
which 205 are English speakers) and 246 bilingual entries (of
which 148 have English as one of their languages). Parents
were provided with a checklist of words (two separate checklists in the case of bilinguals) and asked how many of those
words the child produces. The vocabulary checklists correlate positively and significantly with laboratory observations
of vocabulary and have been shown to reflect bilingual language acquisition (Marchman, 2002). The English checklist
included 429 words sub-categorized into nouns, verbs, adjectives etc. Also of importance for this work are the 240
words whose concept translation appears in all 10 separate
language checklists. These words provide the nodes in our
child semantic networks. The edges are provided by a measure of semantic connectivity, namely the University of South
Florida Free Association Norms (FAN) (Nelson, McEvoy, &
Schreiber, 2004).

How might such an approach be applied to bilingual first
language acquisition? If learning one lexicon influences the
capacity to learn a second lexicon, then three potential outcomes are possible. Learning the first lexicon may facilitate
the learning of the second; for example, having the concept
dog in English facilitates the acquisition of the word perro in
Spanish. Here semantic words facilitate the learning of related words across languages. The second possibility is that
learning one lexicon inhibits the learning of a second lexicon. This is possible if a child uses mutual exclusivity across
languages and thus fails to map perro onto dog after learning the word dog. This failure to map should have noticeable
repercussions, because it allows semantically similar words

201

The free associations were collected by saying a word (the
cue) and asking an adult to provide a word in response (the
target). From this process, one can establish cue-target pairs.
For example, if the cue is ‘dog’, a participant might respond
with ‘cat’ (the target). This constructs the associative pair
dog-cat. The FAN (Nelson et al., 2004) consists of 5044 word
cues. The FAN is used to construct an adjacency matrix Fi j
such that


Fi j =

Much previous work has established that bilinguals learn
words in one language more slowly than monolinguals learning words in that language. This presents difficulties for early
detection of language impairment in bilinguals, whose may
be over or under-diagnosed with language impairment based
on factors unrelated to their abilities. Thus, before we analyze
the network structure of the monolingual/bilingual children,
we first consider the growth of their respective lexicons over
time. To model the acquisition of unique words or concepts,
x(t), produced by a monolingual or bilingual child by month
t, we make use of a simple statistical model of language acquisition which treats all words equally—i.e., the binomial
distribution. Let x be the number of words or concepts a child
knows, integer valued in the range [0, N]. Children started to
produce words in our data at t = 6 months. Thus we assume
x(6) = 0 and dx
dt |t=6 = 0. We also note that there is an upper
bound x ≤ N due to the checklist being a subset of the actual
number of words/concepts produced by the child. Thus our
model should show asymptotic behavior limt→∞ x(t) = N. We
consider a one parameter binomial distribution showing such
behavior, x|t ∼ B(q(t, α), N), where

q(t, α) = 1 − exp −α(t − 6)2 , α > 0

language, there is little difference between the monolingual
and bilingual learning curves where Rmax
M = 7.40 ± 0.08 and
Rmax
B = 7.51 ± 0.12 words/month. This is consistent with the
idea that even though the frequency of words in the learning
environment is different, the frequency in the number of concepts is similar.

Properties of earliest learned English words
In previous work we found that age of acquisition was correlated with associative indegree (Hills, Maouene, Maouene,
Sheya, & Smith, 2009b). If bilingual children show the same
pattern of learning, then their earliest learned words should
also show a bias for higher associative indegree. Figure 2
shows two measures of indegree in relation to age of acquisition (AoA) of English words for both monolingual and
bilingual children. The age of acquisition is defined via logistic regression as the age at which 50% of children know
the word. For the indegree we consider two network sizes
of the final size child FAN network (395 words) and the
full adult FAN network (5044 words). From simple regression analysis, we see in both cases that monolinguals and
bilinguals show a negative correlation between AoA and k:
(Monolinguals: β = −0.347 & − 0.037, p < 0.001) (Bilinguals: β = −0.510 & = −0.0567, p < 0.001).

We can construct the likelihood function L (α) = p(x|t, α)
given data (x,t) = {(xi ,ti )}ni=1 as follows:
n  
N
L (α) = ∏
q(ti , α)xi (1 − q(ti , α))N−xi
(2)

i=1
By the usual technique of maximising the log-likelihood for
both the monolingual and bilingual datasets, we can find the
maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) α̂M and α̂B . The resulting best fits and MLEs are given in figure 1. It is clear that
monolingual English children learn words at a faster rate, R,
with maximum Rmax
M = 14.6±0.2 words/month than bilingual
children (Rmax
=
10.3 ± 0.2 words/month). However, when

which show preferential acquisition of words with high indegree.
These results from our dataset suggest that the general order in which monolinguals and bilinguals learn English words
is very similar, driven by the contextual diversity of the English learning environment, with little influence from the alternate language on word acquisition. However, this tells us
little about how the learning of a word in one language influences the learning of its translational equivalent, or its influence on clustering. The next sections address such questions.

Is semantic network structure altered by bilingual
first language acquisition?
Figure 4 presents a typical English language network with
edges defined by the free association norms. There are numerous network metrics for analysis of network structure.
Here we chose four measures often associated with network
analysis and indicative of general connectivity. These are the
number of nodes (words), the clusterring coefficient, the diameter of the network, and the density of the network. These
network measures allow us to evaluate how the semantic
structure of learned words changes as a result of learning two
languages. Table 2 presents the results of this analysis. The
results show that, after controlling for the number of words
in the network (which is larger for monolinguals), bilingual
children have similar clustering coefficients and similar density, but possibly smaller diameter networks. This supports
the hypothesis that bilinguals are largely learning similar sets
of words as monolinguals, though subtle differences may exist.

with β > 0 in both cases. The next word is then sampled via
equation (3) from the remaining word list. This process is repeated until no words remain. For every N ∈ {1, 2, · · · , Nmax },
a network was formed using the words selected by equation
3 and with the FAN edge structure. This gives one realisation
of our network growth model. We then averaged over 500 realisations, calculating the mean growth curves hki(N, β). Our
best-fit value βˆ was then calculated for each model by minimising the MSE (mean squared error) between our model
and the dataset {hki j , N j }nj=1 , i.e.

It is clear from Figure 2 that words are acquired in relation to
their indegree, with larger indegree nodes being acquired earlier in the growth of the network. This is suggestive of learning orders of words based on the value of their indegree. Previous work has investigated several learning rules associated
with the growth of semantic networks (Hills et al., 2009b). In
this section, we examine two versions of these learning rules:
preferential acquisition and preferential attachment.
We consider two1 simplistic one-parameter models which
show such behavior. Both models select a unique word (node
i) from the subset W of the English MCDI word list that is
present in the FAN data (395 words in total). It is then added
to the existing network according to a probability distribution
P(i) dependent on the indegree Kiin of that word (or a combination of the indegrees k j in the child network given that
word i was added). Here we define the in-degree Kiin to be the
number of unique cue words for which that word is a target
in the entire adult FAN dataset of 5044 words. A realisation
of these models is constructed as follows: A word i ∈ W is
sampled without replacement, and added to the child network
according to the following discrete probability distributions

The results are given in Table 1. We see that preferential acquisition performs considerably better, and the similarity in βˆ
suggests this.
However, to see if there is any bias in word acquisition, we
also include a simulation of random word learning that samples from a uniform distribution of the word list in the same
way as described above. Plots of hki along with ±2σ prediction intervals are included in figure 3 for each N, where
σ is the standard deviation from 500 realisations. The plots
show a clear difference between random word learning and
the data for monolinguals and bilinguals, and favors models
1 Other models of preferential attachment and acquisition were
considered, with similar results.

acquisition. We achieve this by finding a value of βˆ for nonEnglish word aquisition in the same way as for English words
(βˆ = 0.018 ± 0.001), and using the best-fit models to simulate
the acquisition of English and non-English words independently. This was repeated 103 times to find the mean fraction
of translational equivalents and the standard deviation for the
lexicon sizes of the bilingual dataset. A Z-score was then calculated for each bilingual child and results are presented in
Figure 5. With a mean Z-score of 1.44 and p = 0.075, the
bilingual children tend to overproduce translational equivalents compared with an independent growth hypothesis, suggesting facilitation.

Discussion

Associative properties of translational equivalents
Translational equivalents represent words that children can
produce in both languages. If the two languages are learned
as if the speaker were simply two monolinguals, then the earliest translational equivalents should have features that are
consistent with those words that are learned earliest among
monolinguals. Indeed, the properties of translational equivalents should be predictable from examining duplicate word
learning among randomly chosen pairs of control (monolingual) learners. If translational equivalents follow a similar
process of acquisition as to words for monolinguals, then
these words should be words that have high associative indegree. To investigate this, we examined the translational
equivalents in the bilingual lexicons for their associative indegree, and compared these with the remaining English words
that were not translational equivalents. As shown in Figure
5, bilingual children’s translational equivalents have a much
higher associative indegree than those words which are not
known in both languages (t(311.68) = −19.53, p < 0.001).
Though the above evidence suggests that translational
equivalents may be acquired with similar precedence for both
languages in a bilingual lexicon, it does not provide a basis for determining whether or not one language is influencing the acquisition of another. As noted in the introduction,
we may see semantic facilitation or inhibition. The network
measures above suggest potential changes, but are difficult to
interpret in relation to translational equivalents. To investigate this further, we compared the growth in the fraction of
translational equivalents in bilingual children to independent
growth of monolingual lexicons as modelled by preferential

This research asks how bilingual children acquire words in
an early learning environment. Motivated by similar research
of monolingual children, answers to this question were advanced based on combining language acquisition models with
semantic networks derived from free association data. Initial analysis of word learning curves showed a smaller rate
in the number of English words learned by bilingual children
as compared to monolingual children. Similar analysis on
the number of unique concepts learned showed no such difference. This is consistent with the claim that exposure to
English words in a bilingual learning environment correlates
with the rate at which the child learns those words.
By considering adult free association norms and their relation with age of acquisition, we constructed semantic networks for both monolinguals and bilinguals. From analyses
of their respective English word network properties, we found
a high degree of similarity in how both networks grow. Bilinguals and monolingual data both supported a model based
on preferential acquisition by associative indegree, consistent with the amplified associative structure in child-directed
speech (Hills, 2012). Moreover, the models’ parameter values were identical for monolingual and bilingual children.
This suggests that the general order in which bilinguals learn
English words is largely independent of the other language,
and that this order is different from random word learning. However, bilingual children do show a potential for
language facilitation–with words in one language facilitating
the learning of the translational equivalent in the second language. This was indicated by bilinguals overproducing trans-

lational equivalents in comparison to simulated growth networks based on preferential acquisition, reflecting a potential
for facilitation of word acquisition during early bilingual language acquisition.
