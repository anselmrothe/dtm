in a time span of weeks/months (a more realistic time scale
for ideation phases in typical design projects). Relatedly,
there may be low expected returns with few samples of low
probability/high gain choices. At shorter time scales, crea-
tors might not have enough samples to consistently find
these “hidden gems” for maximal inspirational payoff.
   An additional issue in prior studies is a lack of statistical
power. Among existing experimental studies, most have an
N of 12 or less per treatment cell (Chiu & Shu, 2012; Hen-
der et al., 2002; Malaga, 2000); only 4 studies had an N of
18 or better per cell (Chan et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2013; Gon-
çalves et al., 2013; Tseng et al., 2008), and they are evenly
split in support/opposition for the benefits of far sources.
Among the few correlational studies, only Dahl and Moreau
(2002) had an acceptable study design in this regard, with
119 participants and a reasonable range of conceptual dis-
tance. Enkel and Gassmann (2010) only sampled 25 cases,
and suffered from range restriction because they only sam-
pled cases of cross-industry transfer.
   Thus, the mixed empirical evidence base may reflect the
proliferation of false negatives due to insufficient statistical
power (potentially exacerbated by small or potentially zero
effects at short time scales); on the other hand, the under-
powered designs may have also yielded severe overestima-
tion of effect sizes (i.e., false positives; Button et al., 2013).
   A final methodological problem has to do with problem

Measures
Conceptual Distance The unique nature of our dataset pre-
sented some methodological challenges to measuring dis-
tance. The complex and multifaceted nature of the various
design problems made it difficult to distinguish between
“within” and “between” domain sources in a consistent and
principled manner. Continuous distance measures were an
attractive alternative, but were too costly to obtain from
human raters due to the large number of sources. Even with
sufficient time, we were concerned about rater fatigue, pos-
sibly leading to poor reliability or drift in rating standards.
To address these challenges, we employed a computational
approach to measuring distance.
   We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei et al.
2003) to learn a high-dimensional topic space from the full-          Figure 2: Topics found by LDA within examples of near
