Results
Accuracy measurements
In order to measure participant estimates, partici-
pant bars were normalized on every trial. The
height of each bar could have one of 100 equal
height increments (a height of 1 being the shortest
bar possible and 100 being the tallest bar possi-
ble). Each bar was normalized by taking its height
and dividing it by the summed height of all drawn
bars for that trial. This normalization provided a
probability distribution of a participant’s slot es-
timates on every trial. An accuracy score was
generated for each participant on each trial by
comparing the overlap between the participant’s
distribution of estimates and the computer’s dis-
tribution of ball drops. Accuracy scores could
range between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating perfect
overlap between participant and computer distri-
butions.
