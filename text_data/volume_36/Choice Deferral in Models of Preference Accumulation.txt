          Consequences of Choice Deferral
Extreme options
    The above section discussed how the probability of
deferral is affected by the composition of the choice set.
Here we study how allowing for the possibility of deferral
can alter the choice probabilities of the options in the choice
set. This has been empirically examined by Dhar and
