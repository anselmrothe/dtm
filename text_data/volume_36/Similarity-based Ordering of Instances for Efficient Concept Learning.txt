predict that between-category comparisons should best be
made using similar instances, while within-category compar-
isons should be made using dissimilar instances, as long as
the instances are still similar enough to allow for meaningful
alignment. Both types of comparisons are potentially impor-
tant in learning concepts and the best weighting between them
will be different across learning situations, depending on the
specific task, context, experience of the learner, and structure
of concepts (Goldstone, 1996).

The pattern in the number of scene views for solved prob-

a significant benefit of between-, but no influence of within-
category similarity.

The first experiment provided insight into the effect that dif-
ferent types of comparisons and the similarity of the com-
pared scenes have on learning performance. We promoted                  (a) within: sim, between: sim     (b) within: dis, between: sim
either within-category or between-category comparisons by
showing a sequence of pairs of specifically selected scenes.
We now use a more natural way of presentation in which all
scenes of the PBP are shown simultaneously. We still ma-
nipulate the similarity structure of comparisons – in a slightly
more indirect way – by arranging the scenes differently across
conditions.
   In order to allow a direct comparison to the previous se-
quential scene presentation, we included the best condition
from Experiment 1 additionally to four similarity conditions
in the new simultaneous presentation schedule.                          (c) within: sim, between: dis     (d) within: dis, between: dis
