role in learning and development. Nonetheless, little is
known about children’s strategies for inquiry and how they
change in the course of development. Here we have
provided some first insights into the adaptive flexibility of
children’s strategies for asking questions and proposed a
tentative heuristic model. We hope that these initial steps
help pave the way for additional research involving a
broader range of question types and experimental paradigms
and incorporating strategies for information search beyond
questions, such as direct observation and experimentation.
