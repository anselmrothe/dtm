   Hypothesis sparsity and information search
Theoretical results showing the value of positive evidence
do not imply that the positive test strategy is universally the
best approach (Klayman & Ha, 1987; Austerweil & Griffiths,
2011; Navarro & Perfors, 2011). Rather, they imply that it
works when the possible hypotheses are sparse. If hypothe-
ses are thought of as indicating meaningful subsets of some
larger domain, the sparsity of a hypothesis refers to the pro-
portion of all members of a domain that are selected. Sparse
hypotheses include fewer than half of the members of the rel-
evant domain (Navarro & Perfors, 2011). For example, in the
domain LIVING SPECIES the category DOGS is sparse, while
AEROBIC ORGANISM is a not sparse, since most living things
are not dogs, but do metabolise oxygen. Sparsity can vary in

while both differ from the even condition in terms of the rel-

of each kind of plankton, a condition which need not hold in
general. The true category rules were also highly restricted,
in that they were all thresholds on a single dimension, bi-
nary, and strictly complementary. Natural categories are of-
ten non-binary, nested or otherwise overlapping, and often
involve multiple dimensions.
    Further work is required to explore how people weigh up
the value of information-seeking actions under these more
complex conditions. The results presented here suggest that
some such consideration of information utility is an essential
component of any complete description of natural active con-
cept learning. Where hypothesis sparsity information is avail-
able, as it is in many natural domains, people’s information-
seeking behavior is informed by the structure of the domain,
even when that structure is abstract and conceptual in nature.
