given task in an optimal manner with the available
information and some specified constraints (e.g., Geisler,           (b)

           Size Discrimination Experiment
The purpose of this experiment is to obtain the value of free
parameters σItemN and σLate. We measured accuracies for size
discrimination in a single item condition and four set size
conditions. The discrimination threshold in a single item
condition corresponds to σLate; those of four set size
condition correspond to the σItemN. Figure 2 shows examples

The ideal observer’s discriminabilities of each model were
shown in Figure 6 (top left). We calculated statistical
efficiencies for the mean data of four observers using the
equation (2). The efficiencies are presented in Figure 6 as a
function of the set size. The efficiencies of Global
Averaging Model without item noise (GAM1) were varied
across set sizes. When the set sizes are 2 and 4, the
efficiencies approximated 100%, whereas when they are 9
and 16, the efficiencies approximated 70%. The efficiencies
of Global Averaging Model with item noise (GAM2)
exceeded 100%, especially when the difference between set
average and test size was smaller, indicating that the human
observers did not adopt these strategies. The efficiencies of
the LSM far exceeded 100%, indicating that the
performance of human observers was higher than those of
the models. This means that the human observers did not
adopt this strategy.
                        Discussion
This study investigated sampling properties of visual
information used by human observers in deriving an average
representation of item set introducing three ideal observer
models. We measured the performance of the Size
Averaging Task for each ideal observer model and for
human observers. Then, we compared the performance of
the ideal observer of each model to the performance of            Figure 6: The ideal observer’s discriminabilities (top left)
