Present Experiments
Two experiments directly compared student learning after
creating visual or verbal explanations of STEM phenomena,
a bicycle pump or chemical bonding, conducted in the
course of regular activities in science classes. In both cases,
students created explanations after the lessons were
completed. Spatial ability was assessed; previous research
has revealed that those high in spatial or mechanical ability
perform better on learning STEM concepts (e. g., Hegarty &
Just, 1993; Leutner, Leopold, & Sumfleth, 2009; Tversky,
Heiser, and Morrison, 2013).
   Explaining the Workings of a Bicycle Pump
Method
Participants Participants were 127 (59 female) 7th and 8th
grade students, ages 12-14, enrolled in an independent
school in New York City.
Materials Each participant was given the Vandenberg-Kuse
Mental Rotation Test (MRT) (1978), a 12-inch Spalding
bicycle pump, a blank 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper, a 16 question
post-test.
Procedure On the first of two non-consecutive school days,
participants completed the MRT as a whole-class activity.
On the second day, participants were given the pump with
instructions to try to understand how it worked. This
segment was untimed. Participants were allowed to
manipulate and take apart the pump. Next, students were
asked to explain the workings of the bicycle pump, either
verbally on paper or visually. After completing the
explanation, participants were given a post-test that had 8
structural and 8 functional true/false questions.
Coding Explanations
Coding for Structure and Function. A maximum score of
twelve points was awarded for the inclusion and labeling of
six structural components: chamber, piston, inlet valve,
outlet valve, handle, and hose. Information was coded as
functional if it depicted or described the function/movement
of an individual part, or the way multiple parts interact.
There was no maximum imposed on the number of
functional units.
Coding of Essential Features. Both kinds of explanations
were coded for the inclusion of information essential to its
function according to a four-point scale (adapted from Hall,
Bailey, & Tillman, 1997). One point was given if both the
inlet and the outlet valve were clearly present in the drawing
or described in writing, one point was given if the piston
inserted into the chamber was shown or described to be
airtight, and one point was given for each valve if they were
shown or described to be opening/closing in the correct
direction.
Coding Arrows and Multiple Steps. For the visual
explanations, three uses of arrows were coded and tallied:
labeling a part or action, showing motion, or indicating

sequence. For both visual and verbal explanations, the
number of discrete steps was coded.

positively with post-test scores, r = .197, p<.05).
Multiple Steps. The number of steps used by participants
ranged from one to six. Participants whose explanations,
whether verbal or visual, contained multiple steps scored
significantly higher (M = .76, SD = .18) on the post-test
than participants whose explanations consisted of a single
step (M = .67, SD = .19), F(1, 126) = 5.02, p<.05.
