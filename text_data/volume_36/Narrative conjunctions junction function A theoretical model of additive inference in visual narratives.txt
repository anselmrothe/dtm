   Visual narratives often depict images of individual characters
without showing the larger scene, meaning that this whole spatial
environment must be inferred from these component parts.
However, few theoretical models of narrative or discourse have
attempted to explain the generation of such “additive” inference.
This paper explores the complex interactions between narrative
structure and meaning within these types of discourse phenomena,
situated within the model of Visual Narrative Grammar based on
Jackendoff’s (2002) Parallel Architecture of linguistic structure.
Narrative “Conjunction” repeats a single narrative category within
a broader constituent, allowing for expansion of a sequence beyond
the canonical narrative arc. These conjoined units then correspond
to semantic structures in a variety of ways, allowing an “additive”

2. Graphic structure is the physical structure of lines and
shapes, which map these physical features to basic meanings
(Cohn, 2013a). Conceptual information is broken up into
two parts: The event structure stores the meaning of the
situations and events that take place in and between images.
Discrete events typically have a preparation, head, and coda,
while continuous processes end in a termination
(Jackendoff, 2007). Spatial structure conveys then a
geometric type of meaning (Jackendoff, 2002) such as how
characters relate to a larger environmental space. Finally,
the narrative structure organizes meaning into a coherent
sequence. Here, the narrative structure is fairly simple: the
preparatory action in the first panel maps to an Initial, while
the completed action maps to a Peak. These are both
canonical mappings of semantics to narrative. Together,                        Figure 3: Parallel architecture for Figure 1b.

between the structures, i.e., the “Mental Environment” (“ε”)
for the scene. That is, they designate the spatial structure
built by the concatenation of multiple entities.
                 Entity-Conjunction
E-Conjunction is not the only type of interface between
conjoined panels and meaning. Consider the somewhat
gruesome example in Figure 4 from Inoue Takehiko’s
Vagabond. Here, a single character pulls a knife out of
his chest while his friends (panel 2) look on. After
setting up the characters in the first two panels, panels 3
and 4 show Initials that start the action of the man
pulling the knife out of his chest. Though they are
conjoined, these panels do not use E-Conjunction,
because they show a part-whole relationship to construct
the notion of a single entity rather than a whole scene.
  Entity-Conjunction (N-Conjunction) thus uses panels
showing parts of a character to build a singular entity.
We can stipulate a correspondence rule to reflect this
difference:
NS-CS Rule 2: N-Conjunction
1. Given a surface structure that uses the Conjunction
     Rule where each panel features different aspects of a
     single entity, map each narrative category to their
     corresponding parts of an entity in semantic structure.            Figure 5. Action-Conjunction in the comic B.P.R.D.
2. Then interface the whole constituent to a broader                                (Mignola, Sook, et al. 2003)
     semantic entity consisting of the parts contained in the
     panels of that constituent (η).                                 We can state this version of Conjunction in rule form as:
                                                              2052

                                                                 semantic network. Because of this, each panel does not

     Rule where each panel features different
     aspects of a single event or action, map
     each narrative category to their
     corresponding parts of an event in
     semantic structure.
2. Then interface the whole constituent to a
     broader event structure consisting of the
     parts contained in the panels of that
     constituent.
  Again, this correspondence rule uses the
general Conjunction Rule, but interfaces the
panels to various aspects of events. In Figure
5, the event of ‘conjuring fire’ maps each
shape onto a different Initial panel, though
the full event maps to the whole upstairs
Initial. That is, the whole constituent is about
conjuring fire, which manifests iteratively in
different representations.
            Semantic networks
Another type of Conjunction draws together
related or unrelated panels to form a larger
meaning. Saraceni (2000, 2001) noted that
panels may share broader aspects of a
semantic network, without conveying an
explicit narrative. Consider Figure 6, which shows                      Figure 6. S-Conjunction showing conjoined panels
