nodes to different regions in both relational fields. Through
these connections, each production node can evoke a specific
pattern of activation in the fields (and can conversely be pre-
activated by that pattern). Each of these activation patterns
is an instantiation of a featural or spatial concept in metric
perceptual space. Note that, while the patterned connections
have been hand-coded here, they should ultimately be ac-
quired based on neurally realistic learning.
   Nodes representing intention and CoS control all aspects
of sequentiality. This includes the order in which the stored
concepts are invoked, the order in which the roles are filled,
and consequently which object is assigned to which role. For
each role exists a pair of an intention node and a CoS node
(green and red circles in Fig. 2, respectively). Each intention
node drives activation in the corresponding column of pro-
duction nodes and in specific fields associated with each role
(e.g., the reference field). The CoS node in turn receives in-
put from these fields, detects the formation of activation peaks
there, and inhibits the associated intention node when the re-
spective role has been filled.
   To initiate processing, all intention nodes are simultane-
ously activated by user input. Sequentiality is enforced by
