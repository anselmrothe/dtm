Abstract
Previous work suggests that negative sentences are more difficult to process than positive sentences. A supportive context, however, can mitigate this effect. We investigate the role
of context on negation by measuring the processing cost of
negation with and without a visual context (Study 1) and then
systematically varying the strength of the context (Study 2).
We find that a supportive visual context has a graded effect
on negation processing. We then create a model to compute
the informativeness of an utterance in context, and find that a
model that considers both the surprisal of an utterance and the
surprisal of seeing a referent is highly correlated with reaction
times. Our data suggest that pragmatic factors likely explain
the processing costs of negation.

Introduction
Language is a powerful tool that allows us to describe not
only the state of the world as we see it, but also the world as
it is not. If I am a regular at a coffee shop and always order
chai, but the shop has run out today, the barista might say “We
don’t have any chai today” when I enter. Negative sentences
are very informative when expectations are violated.
Although negation is critical for communicating many
meanings, processing negative sentences can be slow and effortful. In sentence verification tasks, participants who are
asked to evaluate the truth of a sentence describing a picture take significantly longer to evaluate negative sentences
compared to positive ones (Clark & Chase, 1972; Carpenter & Just, 1975; Just & Carpenter, 1971, 1976). In EEG
experiments, sentences in which the final noun is semantically unexpected elicit an N400 response, and this response
is found even when a negative makes the sentence logically
true (e.g. “A robin [is/is not] a truck”)—suggesting that negation is slow to integrate with the rest of the sentence (Fischler,
Bloom, Childers, Roucos, & Perry, 1983; Lüdtke, Friedrich,
De Filippis, & Kaup, 2008). Similar results have been found
in probe-recognition tasks (Kaup & Zwaan, 2003; Kaup,
Ludtke, & Zwaan, 2006; Hasson & Glucksberg, 2006). Collectively, this work suggests that processing negative sentences is often difficult.
There is a critical difference, however, between evaluating
a sentence in the lab and comprehending speech in the real
world. According to Grice’s Cooperative Principle (Grice,
1975), speakers should produce utterances that are truthful,
relevant, and informative. Negative sentences presented without context violate this principle. If the barista says “we don’t
have chai today” to a customer who always orders coffee, this
utterance would be neither relevant nor informative. In gen-

eral, negations are produced when there is some expectation
that the speaker wishes to reverse.
Congruent with this Gricean account, a number of studies have shown that a supportive context mitigates the processing cost of negation (Wason, 1965; Glenberg, Robertson,
Jansen, & Johnson-Glenberg, 1999; Lüdtke & Kaup, 2006;
Nieuwland & Kuperberg, 2008; Dale & Duran, 2011). Some
contexts are more effective than others at reducing processing demands. For example, contexts that explicitly mention a
negated characteristic (Lüdtke & Kaup, 2006) or that present
the negation within a dialogue (Dale & Duran, 2011) elicit
faster reaction times, perhaps because the negation is more informative. But although these findings are congruent with the
idea that pragmatic expectations are the source of negation’s
processing cost, they do not directly test that hypothesis. The
goal of our current work is to make such a test.
We propose that negative sentences are more informative in
contexts that set up a strong expectation that is violated. If the
processing cost of negation is pragmatic, then more informative negative sentences should elicit smaller reaction times.
How should we quantify informativeness in context? Recent
modeling work quantifies pragmatic reasoning in simple experimental contexts (Frank & Goodman, 2012; Goodman &
Stuhlmüller, 2013). The assumption underlying this work is
that speakers are informative—they will produce utterances
that will pick out smaller subsets of the context, leaving as
little ambiguity as possible for the listener. We use this definition of informativeness to provide a quantitative interpretation of our hypothesis.
To link informativeness—as computed in a probabilistic
model—to reaction time, we assume that reaction time is proportional to surprisal. Surprisal is an information-theoretic
measure of the amount of information carried by an event (in
this case, an utterance in some context) based on its probability. Surprisal has been used effectively to predict reaction
times from probabilistic models (Levy, 2008); this work provides inspiration for our current model.
We test the hypothesis that pragmatic surprisal explains the
processing cost of negative sentences. Study 1 measures this
processing cost, replicating previous findings that context facilitates the processing of negation. Study 2 investigates the
effect of the strength of the context by parametrically varying the base rate of a negated feature. We compute the surprisal of sentences in these contexts, and find that a model of
pragmatic informativeness predicts the relationship between
context and reaction time. These results support the idea that
context affects negative sentence processing by modulating
listeners’ expectations.

Study 1: Context vs. No Context
To test whether non-linguistic contextual expectations alleviate the processing cost of negative sentences, we constructed
a simple sentence verification task based on Clark and Chase
(1972). Previous studies of the relationship between context
and negation have required participants to actively engage
with the context, either by describing pictures (Wason, 1965)
or reading sentences (Glenberg et al., 1999). Here, participants passively viewed a visual context, eliminating linguistic
confounds in previous work.

Method
Participants We recruited 100 participants to participate in
an online experiment through the Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
(mTurk) website.1 Participants ranged in age from 18-65; 63
were male and 37 female. We restricted participation to individuals in the United States. We paid participants 30 cents to
participate, which took approximately 5 minutes to complete.
Stimuli Twenty-eight trial items were created in which a
character was shown holding either two of the same common, recognizable objects (e.g. two apples), or holding nothing. On each trial a sentence of the form “[NAME] [has/has
no] [ITEM]” was written. Half of the sentences were positive
and half were negative, and they were paired with pictures
such that half were true and half were false. The experiment
was fully crossed, with participants receiving seven true positive, seven false positive, seven true negative and seven false
negative sentences in a randomized order over the course of
the study.
Participants were randomly assigned to the “no context”
condition or the “context” condition. Participants in the no
context condition saw a blank screen with a fixation cross
before each trial, while participants in the context condition
viewed a context slide. The context slide showed three characters, each holding the same two identical items. The characters all differed from the trial character and from each other
in hair and shirt color. A sentence instructed participants to
“Look at these [boys/girls]!” (Fig. 1).
1 Previous work has shown that mTurk is an effective tool for
collecting RT data (Crump, McDonnell, & Gureckis, 2013).

Procedure Participants were first presented with an instructions screen which described the task and informed them that
they could stop at any time. Once they accepted the task, they
were given eight positive sentence practice trials with feedback about incorrect responses.
In each trial, participants saw a context (3s) and then a picture and a sentence. They were asked to read the sentence and
respond as quickly and accurately as possible with a judgment
of whether it was true or false when applied to the picture.
We recorded reaction times for each trial, measured as the
time from when the picture and sentence were presented to
the moment when the response was made.
Data Processing We excluded from analysis 6 participants
who did not list English as their native language, 7 participants for having participated in a previous pilot study, and
4 participants for having an overall accuracy of below 80%.
Thus, data from a total of 83 participants were analyzed. We
also excluded trials with RTs greater than 3 standard deviations from the log-transformed mean.

Results & Discussion
Negative sentences were difficult to process when presented
without context; in context, this effect disappeared (Fig. 2).
This result is congruent with previous work on sentence verification, which has also found a main effect of negation (e.g.
Clark & Chase, 1972) and with work examining the role of
context in negation (e.g. Wason, 1965; Nieuwland & Kuperberg, 2008; Dale & Duran, 2011).
To examine the reliability of these findings, we fit a linear mixed-effects model to participants’ reaction times. We
examined the interaction between sentence type, truth value,
and context on reaction times.2 Results of this model show

a main effect of truth value, with significant faster reaction times for true sentences compared to false sentences
(β = −196, p < .001).3 Although there was no main effect of negation across both conditions, there was an interaction between sentence type and truth value (β = 260,
p < .001), replicating the finding that participants respond
fastest to true positive sentences but slowest to true negative sentences (Clark & Chase, 1972). Critically, there was a
significant 3-way interaction between context condition, sentence type, and truth value (β = −227, p < .01), suggesting
that this interaction was primarily driven by the slow RTs for
true negative sentences in the no context condition.
To understand why context had the strongest effect on true
negative sentences, consider what a true negative trial looks
like in the no context condition. These are trials in which
the participant has no expectation about what the character
might be holding, because no context was provided to set up
such an expectation. The participant would then see a picture
of an empty-handed boy with the sentence “Bob has no apples.” These types of trials likely cause participants to falter
because there is no reason for “apples” to be mentioned at all.
However, when a participant first views a context such as the
one in Fig. 1, they can form an expectation that boys typically have apples. Now, when participants see a boy with no
apples, a sentence such as “Bob has no apples” makes sense.

Method
Participants We again recruited participants from mTurk,
200 in 2a (129 male, 71 female) and 400 in 2b (205 male,
195 female), ages 18 – >65. We again restricted participation
to individuals in the US and paid 30 cents for this 5 minute
study.
Stimuli Study 2a used the same 28 trial items and sentence
types as those used in Study 1. A between-subjects factor
determined what type of context participants saw. Context
conditions showed 30 , 31 , 23 , or 33 of the characters holding
objects. Trial stimuli were identical to those in Study 1.
Study 2b used 48 items. The contexts were the same as in
Study 2a, except that each context contained 4 characters and
there were therefore 5 context conditions ( 40 , 41 , 24 , 34 or 44 ).
Procedure The procedure for Study 2a was identical to that
of Study 1, with participants randomly assigned to condition.
In Study 2b, participants were given 4s (instead of 3s) to view
the context before the experiment advanced. This latency was
changed to give participants more time to look at the slightly
larger contexts; the procedure was otherwise identical.
Data Processing We excluded 35 participants who did not
list English as their native language (9 in 2a and 16 in 2b),
24 participants for participating in a previous iteration of the
experiment (3 in 2a and 21 in 2b), and 35 participants for
having an overall accuracy below 80% (11 in 2a and 24 in
2b). Thus, we analyzed data from a total of 177 participants
in Study 2a and 339 participants in Study 2b. As in Study 1,
we only analyzed correct trials and excluded trials with RTs
greater than 3 SDs from the log-transformed mean.
Because we were interested in the effect of context, results
from these two studies were combined and analyzed together
with context condition re-coded as a continuous variable by
calculating the proportion of people in each context condition
who had a target item (e.g. the 13 condition in Study 2a was
recoded as .33).

Study 1 contributes to a body of evidence suggesting that
negative sentences are more felicitous when they negate an
expectation, and that such expectations can be set up by an
appropriate context. In Study 2, we examine how systematically manipulating the strength of the context might produce
changes in reaction times by altering the expectations created
by the context.

Study 2: Varying strength of context
Should all contexts be equally helpful in processing negation?
In Study 2, we parametrically manipulated the strength of the
context. Participants saw contexts consisting of either three
(Study 2a) or four (Study 2b) characters in which some subset
of the characters were holding the target item. If the context
gives participants a glimpse into the “world” that each trial
exists in, this represents a small sample of the base rate of
what the characters in this world look like. By manipulating
this base rate, we can change peoples’ expectations about the
trial character. If the differences in reaction times between
the no context and the context condition in Study 1 are due
to the relative informativeness of the negative utterance based
on the context, we should expect to see a relationship between
the strength of the context and reaction time.

Results and Discussion
As the proportion of target items in the context increased, reaction times tended to decrease, particularly for negative and
false sentences, supporting our hypothesis (Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, reaction times increased slightly when all characters in the context had target items, resulting in a U-shaped
relationship between context and RT.
We fit a linear mixed-effects model to reaction times in response to sentences. We examined the interaction between
sentence type, truth value, and context on reaction times.4 As
in Study 1, we found a significant effect of truth value, with
significantly faster reaction times for true sentences compared
to false sentences (β = −154, p < .001). Although there was

Model 1: Utterance Surprisal

Figure 3: Reaction times for each trial type across different conditions. Responses to true sentences are shown on the
left, and false sentences are shown on the right. Negative
sentences are shown in grey, and positive sentences in black.
Data for Study 2a (3-person contexts) are shown above, and
data for Study 2b (4-person contexts) are shown below. The
context condition is notated by a fraction representing the
number of characters in the context who held target items.
Error bars show 95% confidence intervals.

We modeled the behavior of participants in our experiments
by assuming that reaction time is proportional to the surprisal
of the utterance w, given the context C and the speaker’s intended referent rS (following Levy, 2008):
RT ∼ − log(P(w|rs ,C)).

(1)

We then define the probability of the utterance as proportional
to its utility (following Frank & Goodman, 2012):
P(w|rs ,C) ∝ eU(w;rs ,C) ,

not a significant main effect of negation, there was a significant interaction between sentence type and truth value, such
that the difference between true positive and true negative was
greater than the difference between the two types of false sentences (β = 159, p < .001). There was also a linear effect of
context, such that as the proportion of people with the target item in the context increased, reaction times decreased
(β = −197, p < .001). As before, there was a significant
3-way interaction between context, sentence type, and truth
value, such that the linear effect of context was most striking
in true negative sentences (β = −141, p < .001).
Responses in the 33 and 44 conditions suggest that the relationship between context and RT is not linear (Fig. 3). We
added a quadratic term to our model to test for this nonlinear
effect of context (β = 610, p < .001). The quadratic model
fit our data significantly better in a likelihood comparison test
(χ2 (1) = 80.59, p < .001).
Quantitative manipulation of the strength of the context resulted in systematic changes in the processing cost of negation, particularly for true negative sentences. This finding is
consistent with our initial hypothesis: As the proportion of
people in the context with the target item increases, describ-

(2)

This utility is defined as the informativeness of w minus its
cost D(w):
U(w; rs ,C) = I(w; rs ,C) − D(w).

(3)

Informativeness in context is calculated as the number of bits
of information conveyed by the word. We assume that w has a
uniform probability distribution over its extension in context
(e.g. “boy with apples” applies to any boy who has apples,
leading to a probability of 1/|w| of picking out each individual boy with apples) :
I(w; rs ,C) = −(− log(|w|−1 )).

(4)

The cost term D(w) can then be defined in any number of
ways; in this model we define it as the number of words in
the utterance multiplied by a cost-per-word parameter. Note
that in our experiment, the negative sentences always have
exactly one word more than the positive sentences.
We created a sparse vocabulary which represented possible words to describe the characters. This included the target
utterance (e.g. “apples” and “no apples”), as well as words

2702

that were uniformly true or false of all characters. Combining Equations 2–4, and normalizing Eq. 2 over all possible
words in the vocabulary V , we have:
−1

elog(|w| )−D(w)
(5)
0 −1
0 .
∑w0 ∈V elog(|w | )−D(w )
Combining Eq. 1 with Eq. 5, this model predicts that as the
number of e.g. boys with apples in the context increases, the
informativeness of the negative sentence “Bob has no apples”
increases, because it selects an increasingly smaller subset
of the context. Highly informative sentences will have high
probability, hence lower surprisal and faster RTs.
We fit this model to data from Study 2a, with cost = 3 (Table 1). When the model was fit to the combined data from
Studies 2a and 2b, the cost-per-word parameter remained
the same (Fig. 4). This model accounted for a substantial
amount of variance in participant reaction times from Study
2 (r = .76, p < .001). Nevertheless, the model fails to capture
the U-shaped relationship seen in Study 2; specifically, it underestimates the surprisal of 03 and 40 contexts for positive sentences, and 33 and 44 contexts for negative sentences.In these
trials, participants may have found the target picture surprising regardless of the sentence that they read. For example, in
0

3 and 4 contexts followed by a true positive trial, participants
saw several boys with nothing, and then saw a boy holding
something.

predictions and reaction times, for both Model 1 (Utterance

Parameters are either fit to Study 2a only or to both studies,
as indicated.

P(w|rs ,C) =

Model 2: Utterance and Referent Surprisal
To account for reaction time related to seeing the target picture, we included the surprisal of the referent rS as well as
the surprisal of the utterance w given the referent. We estimated the probability of seeing the referent via the count of
the target property in the context, smoothed with a parameter
λ:
P(rS |C) =

#MatchingPeople + λ
#TotalPeople + 2λ

(6)

We then added − log(p(r|C)) (Eq. 6) to − log(p(w|rs ,C))
(Eq. 5), resulting in:
RT ∼ − log(P(w|rs ,C)) − β log(P(rS |C)).

(7)

Note that this formulation is quite similar to a model which
accounts for the prior probability of the referent p(rS ); the
only difference is our use of a weight β to adjust the different
effects of these two probabilities.
Consider the example in Fig. 1, in which you see three boys
with apples and then a boy with no apples. The sentence “Bob
has no apples” is highly probable—and thus low surprisal—in
this context, because it uniquely identifies the target character
(Eq. 5). In the current model, however, we must also calculate
the surprisal of seeing the target character (i.e. the referent).
In this example, the referent surprisal is high, because the
probability of seeing a boy with no apples in this context is
low (Eq. 6).

We again fit this model to data from Study 2a and compared model predictions to data from Study 2b as well as the

amount of variance in participant reaction times from Study
2 (r = .89, p < .001). We also fit the model to the combined
data from Study 2, which resulted in similar parameter values
(Table 1), and continued to account for a substantial amount
of the variance in RTs (r = .90, p < .001; Fig. 4).

General Discussion
What makes negation so hard? It takes longer to evaluate negative sentences than positive sentences when presented without context, but these effects are mitigated in context. We
suggested a Gricean account: the processing cost of negation is related to the degree to which it violates expectations
about communication in context. In our studies, by changing the proportion of people in the context who held a target
item, we systematically manipulated participants’ contextual
expectations. We found a parametric relationship between the
strength of the context and reaction times, and this relationship was well fit by a model of the surprisal of a sentence and
its referent given the context.
Previous work on sentence processing has suggested that
processing negation is fundamentally difficult, perhaps due
to the processing cost of negating a proposition (e.g. Clark &
Chase, 1972) or the cost of suppressing an affirmative representation (e.g. Kaup & Zwaan, 2003). Our work here suggests that the difficulty of negation may not be unique to negation at all; instead, general pragmatic mechanisms could be
driving this effect. Due to the specific pragmatics of negation, negative sentences presented without context are uninformative and are thus unlikely to be produced, leading to
increased surprisal and slower processing times. In conversation, however, negative sentences are often produced when
some expectation has been violated, decreasing surprisal and
processing time.
Although our specific focus was to understand the processing of negative sentences, this work has implications for
sentence processing more generally. Debates about the ef-

fects of pragmatics on linguistic processing exist in other domains (e.g. the processing of scalar implicatures, Huang &
Snedeker, 2009, 2011; Grodner, Klein, Carbary, & Tanenhaus, 2010). We believe that formal models of pragmatics
can provide insight into these debates and, more generally,
