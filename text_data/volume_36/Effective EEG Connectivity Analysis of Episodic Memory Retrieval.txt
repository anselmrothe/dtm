    Increased information flow from MFG to MTL was
visually evident in a lower frequency band (2–15 Hz) during
retrieval tasks compared with fixation as shown in Figure 2
(c, d). Individual raw EEG traces also revealed that
oscillatory powers of MFG typically increased following the
retrieval tasks as shown in Figure 2 (a, b), however, these
individual changes could not describe the specific direction
of the interregional information flow.
Significant time-frequency zone
To clarify the active information flows associated with
specific frequency and time bands, we found time-frequency
areas showing significantly different dDTF between fixation
and retrieval tasks. Each of differences between dDTF
values of fixation and retrieval is tested by the two sample t-
test with fixed time and frequency. As shown in Figure 3,
time ranges between 0–1000 ms and frequency ranges
between 2–30 Hz showed significant differences (pt-test <
0.05). Differences around 1500 ms were significant as well,
but this time band was not considered as an analysis target
because it was too delayed from the onset of stimuli and
could be caused by irrelative facts.
