Abstract
This study aimed to examine nonverbal expressions of older
adults performing a Feeling-of-Knowing (FOK) metamemory task, since nonverbal cues are considered to serve as
indicators of memory deficit awareness. In a production
experiment, we collected a variety of recalled and unrecalled
answers from older adults (mean age = 79.5) and tested their
accuracy. Nonverbal behavior was annotated manually and
automatically using facial expression detection software. We
found an overall effect of FOK ratings on the use of FOK
related nonverbal features. For recalled items, the participants
used more nonverbal cues with lower FOKs than with higher
FOKs. For unrecalled items, the opposite effect was found. A
subsequent perceptual study showed that third-party judges
were able to estimate older adults’ FOK correctly. Overall,
this study shows that the elderly can be aware of their
memory deficits and display the associated nonverbal cues in
a manner comparable to younger age groups.
Keywords: Meta-memory; Feeling-of-Knowing; nonverbal
cues; older adults.

Introduction
Oftentimes, when asked a question, we can reliably estimate
whether we know the answer or not even before actually
retrieving it from our memory. This type of guess is referred
to as "Feeling-of-Knowing (FOK)" (Hart, 1965) and is
considered to be a form of meta-memory comparable to the
well-known Tip-of-the-Tongue phenomenon. Various
studies have shown that FOK levels correlate with both
verbal and non-verbal expressiveness displayed when
responding to questions (e.g., Krahmer & Swerts, 2005;
Smith & Clark, 1993). These findings indicate that the
presence or absence of particular non-verbal features,
employed in the context of monitoring one’s memory,
signal an individual’s awareness of memory deficits.
Research on children and younger adults showed a link
between FOK accuracy and nonverbal expressiveness
(Krahmer & Swerts, 2005) but there are at least three
reasons to assume that the findings cannot be extended to
older population. First, in older age groups, FOK accuracy
appears to decrease at least for some types of knowledge,
like in episodic memory tasks (e.g., Souchay, Moulin,
Clarys, Taconnat & Isingrini, 2007). The decrease in
accuracy may, in turn, affect the accompanying non-verbal
behavior. Second, older adults are arguably less expressive

in their non-verbal behavior. Although findings on
expressing positive emotions are mixed, negative emotions
like fear and anger are found to be less intense in elderly,
compared to young adults (Carstensen, Pasupathi, Mayr &
Nesselroade, 2000; Levenson, Carstensen, Friesen &
Ekman, 1991), possibly thanks to a better-developed
emotion regulation mechanism (Charles & Carstensen,
2007). Third, the use of non-verbal expressions by the
elderly may be affected by the higher frequency of the
experienced retrieval failures and tip-of-the-tongue states
(Gollan & Brown, 2006). Older adults are more prone to
word retrieval failures than younger adults, for example due
to their greater vocabulary knowledge (Burke, MacKay,
Worthley & Wade, 1991).
In the research reported here, we set out to obtain a
comprehensive overview of the non-verbal cues displayed
by older adults, using a variant of the FOK paradigm, as
applied in earlier question-answering studies (e.g., Smith &
Clark, 1993). In the original paradigm due to Hart (1965),
also referred to as the recall-judgment-recognition
paradigm, participants are exposed to a three-step procedure
starting with a series of general knowledge questions. In
response to these questions (i.e., “What is the capital of
Switzerland?”), participants are either able to recall the
answers (“Bern”) or not (“I don’t know”). Subsequently, for
the unrecalled items, participants are asked to judge whether
or not they believed they would be able to recognize the
correct answer among several wrong alternatives, e.g., when
presented in a multiple-choice test. In the last part of the
procedure - the recognition – they are given a multiplechoice test and asked to select the correct answers to the
previously queried items. Hart (1965) referred to the
participants’ judgment elicited during the second step in the
procedure as their Feeling-of-Knowing. FOKs serve as
assessments that information is available in memory, even
when it has not been retrieved (e.g., Eakin & Hertzog, 2012;
Hart, 1965; Singer & Tiede, 2008).
During the course of answering questions, people undergo
several alternating processes. While being questioned,
people actively search in their mind for the correct answer.
Simultaneously, this retrieval is monitored on a metacognitive level. This means that while formulating or
searching for the correct answer, people are continuously
evaluating whether they are capable to answer the question

1694

correctly or not (e.g., Nelson & Narens, 1990). FOK can be
used as a guidance for monitoring the search for a correct
answer and can help in deciding to continue the search or
resign oneself to an unsuccessful retrieval.
Traditionally, in psychological studies, FOK is used to
describe solely prospective memory tasks, i.e., the feeling of
being able to recognize a correct answer for unrecalled
items (Hart, 1965). In psycholinguistic literature, on the
other hand, FOK is typically examined on a par with
indications of confidence (e.g., Brennan & Williams, 1995).
In this case, FOK is used to describe both prospective and
retrospective memory tasks, and refers to the participant’s
estimate of being able to recognize the correct answer both
for recalled and unrecalled items. Since the outcomes of
psycholinguistic studies on (non-)verbal expressions of
FOK show similarities between signals of high FOK for
unrecalled items and low FOK for recalled items, this study
investigates FOK in both contexts.
Past studies of non-verbal cues associated with FOK
identified specific visual and auditory cues displayed during
the task. For instance, a high FOK experienced for
previously unrecalled items is typically signaled by auditory
cues including linguistic hedges and fillers such as ‘perhaps’
(Smith & Clarke, 1993) and ‘um’ (Corley & Stewart, 2008),
as well as by visual cues, like averted gaze or brow
movements (Swerts & Krahmer, 2005). Similar cues appear
to be used for low FOK in the case of recalled items,
together with high-rise terminals (Scherer, London & Wolf,
1973), or visual cues like smiles and “thinking faces”
(Swerts & Krahmer, 2005).
In the study reported here, we set out three objectives.
First, we explore older adults’ metamnemonic awareness in
relation to their use of nonverbal cues for varied degrees of
FOK experiences. To our knowledge, the nonverbal
behavior accompanying FOK in an older age group has not
been studied before, despite the fact that there are reasons to
believe it may differ from younger age groups, as outlined
above. In this study, we will code nonverbal features
manually, based on a coding scheme used in earlier FOK
studies (e.g., Swerts & Krahmer, 2005). Given that this
existing set of cues is identified for younger age groups, we
will also analyse the visual features with the help of a
comprehensive automatic procedure. Second, we compare
older adults’ FOK accuracy and nonverbal cues of recalled
items (answers) and unrecalled items (non-answers), where
earlier FOK studies seem to focus merely on either recalled
or unrecalled items, or merge the two categories. As a third
and final objective, we explore the decoding of FOK cues
displayed by the older participants by third-party judges (in
the literature referred to as “Feeling-of-Another’sKnowing”, FOAK for short; see Brennan & Williams,
1993). Assuming that the non-verbal cues associated with
FOK fulfil, at least partly, social functions, we expect them
to be recognized by independent observers.

Production Experiment
Method
Participants In total, 24 participants (12 female) took part
in the production experiment. Prior to the analysis, the data
of one of the female participants had to be discarded due to
a recording error, resulting in a sample of 23 participants.
They were recruited in a nursing home in Rotterdam (N =
16) and an activity centre in Tilburg (N = 8) in The
Netherlands. Participants’ age ranged from 70 to 95 years
(M = 79.5, SD = 6.3) and according to their caretakers, they
did not suffer from any major cognitive impairment.
Beforehand, participants signed a consent form by which
they gave permission to be filmed during the experiment
and for the recordings to be used for scientific purposes.
Stimuli Similar to earlier FOK studies (e.g., Smith &
Clarke, 1993), participants were asked knowledge questions
in a quiz-like setup. In order to collect a substantial amount
of lexically distinct answers, while keeping the duration of
the experiment within reasonable limits, participants were
exposed to one of two question sets, each of which
contained twenty knowledge questions, selected from
Trivial Pursuit board games. Both clusters of questions
resulted in answers that were likely to be either easy or hard
to retrieve. To prevent feelings of frustration, participants
were assured beforehand that the range of question
difficulty varied and they were not expected to be able to
answer all questions correctly. The question sets were
pretested with four older adults (65 to 92 years old) who
were not a part of the experimental group. They provided
both answers and non-answers to the questions in the sets.
Experimental Procedure The production experiment took
place in environments familiar to the participants. Following
the FOK paradigm (Hart, 1965), participants underwent a
three-step procedure, without any time restrictions.
First, participants were asked to answer a series of twenty
questions, presented orally to them by the experimenter.
Participants sat in a chair in front of a video camera that
recorded them during the experiment. The experimenter was
positioned behind the camera and aimed to respond to
comments of the participants as less as possible, except
repeating a question if needed. In this way, participants were
unable to pick up any feedback cues about the
(in)correctness of their answers. In the second part of the
experiment, the participants were given a paper form, which
listed the exact same sequence of questions. For each
question, participants were asked to indicate (on a sevenpoint Likert scale) how sure they were that they would
recognize the correct answer if it was presented in a
multiple-choice test (the FOK score). In the third and last
part of the experiment, the same set of questions was
presented again, as a multiple-choice test in which the
correct answer was mixed with three plausible alternatives.
Participants were urged to respond to every question, even if
this meant they had to guess.

Results
Types of Responses All twenty-three participants answered
twenty questions; in total, 460 utterances were collected in
the production experiment. Recordings contained correctly
recalled items, incorrectly recalled items and unrecalled
items, see Table 1. The majority of the FOK ratings were of
level 7, in line with the attempt to make most of the
questions easy to answer to prevent participants’ discomfort,
leaving a sufficient number of lower FOK ratings to be used
in follow-up measurements.
FOK and Recall Analysis of variance showed that mean
FOK ratings were higher for recalled items than for
unrecalled items (with participants as random factor,
F1(1,22) = 2.36, p < .001, η2p = .11; with items as random
factor: F2(1,19) = 2.33, p < .001, η2p = .10). Moreover,
participants indicated higher FOK ratings for correctly
recalled items than for incorrectly recalled items, (F1(1,21)
= 2.18 p < .01, η2p = .17; F2(1,17) = 2.20, p < .05, η2p = .14).
Average FOK ratings as a function of different answer
categories are presented in Table 1.

study of Krahmer and Swerts (2005), we based the three
visual features on the Facial Action Coding System by
Ekman and colleagues (e.g., Ekman & Rosenberg, 1997). In
this system, facial expressions are described by means of
Action Units (AUs), i.e., numbered muscular actions:
smiling is related to AU 12, 13 and/or 14; eye brow
movement is related to AU 1 and/or 2; and a puzzled face is
related to AU 14, 15, 18, 20 and/or 24, which describe lip
movements, like lip pucker and dimpler in combination with
AU 1, 2, and/or 5, which describe eyebrow movements, and
AU 9 for a nose wrinkle. For representative examples of
visual features used by participants, see figure 1.
Following an explicit labeling protocol, two independent
coders labeled part of the data (a standard 15%) with fairly
acceptable inter-coder agreements (Cohen’s Kappa’s were
.86 for fillers, .72 for high intonation, .69 for delays, .69 for
eyebrow movements, .78 for smiling and .65 for puzzled
faces); the remaining utterances were labeled by one coder.
Both coders were blind to FOK ratings and the questions
preceding the utterances.

FOKs for Unrecalled Items Only In order to establish the
accuracy of the FOK judgments, we compared the FOK
ratings of unrecalled items that were correctly recognized, to
the FOK ratings of incorrectly recognized unrecalled items.
A T-test for independent samples revealed a significant
difference between the two groups, t(183.95) = 2.88, p =
.004 (equal variances not assumed). The FOK ratings were
higher for correctly recognized unrecalled items (M = 3.32,
SD = .51) than for the incorrectly recognized ones (M =
2.44, SD = .39), indicating that the elderly participants were
accurate at predicting the recognition outcome.

Description
The use of fillers (like “um”, or “I’m not
sure, but I think this is…”).
Ending an answer with a high boundary tone.
A silence > 1 sec, preceding an answer.
Moving (one of) the eyebrows from neutral
position.
Moving the corners of the lips upwards.
Combining brow movements, possible nose
wrinkle and lip pucker/dimpler.

FOK and Expressivity An analysis of variance showed an
overall effect of FOK ratings on the number of nonverbal
features used in recalled items, F(1, 266) = 11.75, p < .001,
η2p= .21; with lower FOKs, participants used a larger
amount of nonverbal features than with higher FOKs. For
unrecalled items, there was an opposite effect, F(1, 266) =
5.99, p < .001, η2p= .16; participants used a larger number of
features for high FOK non-answers than for low FOK nonanswers.

FOK and Nonverbal Cues All 460 utterances were
manually transcribed and categorically coded for the
presence or absence of the auditory and visual features as
described in table 2, based on earlier work of Smith and
Clark (1993) and Krahmer and Swerts (2005). With respect
to vocal features, Brennan and Williams (1993) found
correlations between FOK and the use of delays, fillers and
high intonation, when answering a question. Similar to the

1696

Figure 1: Stills illustrating the coded features (from left to
right: eyebrow movement, smiling and puzzled face).

Specifying Nonverbal Cues The labelled features were
analysed individually by means of paired sample T-tests for
all items, comparing the FOKs in the presence and absence
of a feature. Table 3 shows that the presence of the
nonverbal features in recalled items corresponds with a
lower FOK rating, with the exception of eyebrow movement
and smiling. Contrasting results are shown in table 4, which
displays the presence and absence of nonverbal features in
unrecalled items. For delay and high intonation, the FOKs
were higher when the nonverbal feature was present
compared to when it was absent.

fragments contained both recalled (57%) and unrecalled
(43%) items.
In order to explore a possible link between FOK and
different Action Units, we performed a multiple regression
analysis for the two conditions (recalled, unrecalled)
separately, see Table 5. As suggested by Berry (1993), we
excluded all weakly correlated variables prior to the
analyses, ignoring Action Units with correlations < .3
between a given unit and FOK, leaving dimpler (-.31), chin
raise (-.29), lip pucker (-.40), lips part (.28) and fear brow
(.41) for recalled items and nose wrinkle (-.27), dimpler (.29) and lids tight (-.26) for unrecalled items. The
correlation analyses showed no correlation coefficients
exceeding > .9 between the Action Units selected as
predictors in the regression models, thus satisfying the
assumption regarding multi-collinearity.
The regression analysis for recalled items revealed a
significant effect of the dimpler, lip pucker, lip parting, and
the fear brow. For unrecalled items, the dimpler and nose
wrinkle were significantly related to the FOK score. In
addition to the AUs associated with the puzzled face used in
the manual labelling (nose wrinkle, dimpler and eye brow
movement), the comprehensive automatic analysis thus
helped to identify other cues associated with FOK for
recalled items, especially in the lip area. Moreover, different
cues appear to be predictive of the FOK ratings for recalled
items compared to unrecalled items.

Automatic Analysis
For the automatic analysis, we used the software tool for
frame-based automatic facial expression recognition CERT
(Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox; Littlewort et
al., 2011). Based on a machine-learning algorithm, the tool
identifies the face region in a video and detects with a
reasonably high accuracy (comparable to human annotators)
the 44 Facial Action Units in the Facial Action Coding
System (Ekman & Rosenberg, 1997). In total, 440 video
fragments were analysed for the averaged probability of a
particular facial action unit being present in the fragment.
Twenty fragments were discarded because the software was
unable to detect the facial region reliably. The set of

Perception Experiment
In the final part of the research reported here, we examined
to what extent the nonverbal cues displayed by the older
participants in the production experiment could be
interpreted as cues to FOK by third-party judges (Feeling of
Another’s Knowing, FOAK, Brennan & Williams, 1993).

Method
Participants Forty-two younger adults participated as thirdparty judges in this perception study (24 women, age M =

1697

22.8, SD = 6.0). All participants were students of Tilburg
University and received course credits for their input.
Stimuli In total, sixty-four utterances were selected from the
corpus collected in the production study, with an equal
distribution of recalled and unrecalled items, and low and
high FOK ratings. Given the individual differences in the
use of the FOK scale, the lowest or second lowest (or
highest and second highest) score for all answers of that
particular participant were used as instances of a low (or
high) FOK score. Note that the selection of low (and high)
FOK utterances could differ between participants, given that
individuals differed in what they experienced as difficult or
easy questions. This gave a 2 × 2 design (high/low FOK ×
recalled/unrecalled item). The stimuli for the perception test
were randomly selected, but utterances were iteratively
replaced until the following criteria were met: the answers
given in the selected clip had to be lexically different from
each other to avoid that participants in the perception test
would have to judge clips with similar content and the
speaker should appear in clips representing all four
conditions (recalled/unrecalled answer x high/low FOK). To
assure judgments were only based on the (non-)verbal
expression of the speaker, and not by the participants’ own
estimation of the correctness of answers, stimuli were
presented without the questions that preceded answers.
Experimental Procedure Participants were placed in front
of a computer screen in an isolated booth. On the screen,
two sets of thirty-two stimuli (recalled and unrecalled items)
were presented one by one. First, the set containing only
recalled items was shown in one of two random orders.
Participants saw the stimulus ID (1 to 32) and then the
actual stimulus. During a stimulus-interval of three seconds,
participants were instructed to estimate to what extent
speakers were certain about their answer, on a seven-point
Likert scale (the FOAK score). When participants finished
this first set, a second set of thirty-two stimuli was presented
in one of two random orders, containing only unrecalled
items. A stimulus ID was presented (33-64) before the
actual stimulus and the three seconds stimulus interval.
Participants were asked to estimate the chance that the
speaker would recognize the correct answer when the
question would have been presented as a multiple-choice
question instead. Participants were to judge this on a sevenpoint Likert scale (again the FOAK score). To get familiar
with both tasks, participants practised with example stimuli
beforehand.

Results
We conducted two repeated measures analyses with the
participants’ judgment scores (FOAK) as dependent
variable and FOK (high or low FOK) as factor, for both
recalled and unrecalled items. Participants were able to
distinguish between speakers’ high and low FOK for
recalled items, F(1, 41) = 976.28, p < .001, η2p= .96.
Speakers’ high FOK recalled items were judged as more

certain than speakers’ low FOK recalled items (high FOK:
M = 5.39, SD = .43; low FOK: M = 2.83, SD = .47). A
comparable effect was found with respect to FOK for
unrecalled items, F(1, 41) = 403.93, p < .001, η2p= .91. This
means that speakers were judged as more capable of
recalling a correct answer when presented in a multiple
choice test, when they responded with a high FOK
unrecalled item than when they responded with a low FOK
unrecalled item (high FOK: M = 4.33, SD = .56; low FOK:
M = 2.40, SD = .54).

Discussion and Conclusion
This study aimed to examine older adults’ accuracy of FOK
experiences and their use of nonverbal cues for both recalled
and unrecalled items. Therefore, we conducted a production
experiment with older adults, in which we collected
recordings of a variety of answer utterances and
accompanying FOK ratings. We coded all utterances for the
presence of various cues (manually and automatically) and
presented a selection of utterances to third-party judges in a
perception test.
The results of our study support the view that the elderly
are able to produce an accurate FOK for both recalled and
unrecalled items. With regards to recalled items, participants
indicated higher FOK ratings for correctly recalled items
than for incorrectly recalled items. Additionally, FOK
ratings were higher for correctly recognized unrecalled
items than for the incorrectly recognized ones, which is in
line with studies by Hertzog and colleagues (e.g., 2012), but
contradicts earlier results found by Souchay et al. (2007).
Overall, these results indicate that the elderly may be as
accurate at assessing their performance in a metamnemonic
task as younger age groups (e.g., Hart, 1965; Krahmer &
Swerts, 2005).
With respect to nonverbal cues associated with FOK, we
expected the older participants to signal their FOK
differently than younger age groups. In particular, earlier
research has shown that emotional expressiveness appears to
decrease with age (Carstensen et al., 2000; Gross et al.,
1997; Levenson et al., 1991). Therefore, one might expect
older adults to suppress their FOK expressions. In general,
our manual coding study showed an overall effect of FOK
ratings on the use of FOK related nonverbal features in
recalled items. More specifically, with lower FOKs, older
participants used more FOK cues (which were identified
with earlier studies of younger adults and children), than
with higher FOKs. For unrecalled items, we found the
opposite effect; participants were more expressive for high
FOK non-answers than for low FOK non-answers. We can
conclude that similarly to younger age groups, the elderly
tend to display cues to low FOK, despite their lower
emotional expressiveness. According to Charles and
Carstensen (2007), the decline in expressiveness is caused
by a better-developed emotion regulation system by older
adults, which would explain why they express their FOK
similarly to younger adults. FOK expressions are argued to
have a self-presentational, face-saving nature: expressing a

1698

low FOK might lower recipients’ expectations regarding the
speaker’s mnemonic performance (Smith & Clark, 1993).
The specific cues older adults use to signal their FOK for
recalled items include the presence of fillers, delay, high
intonation and puzzled face, according to the manual
coding. In addition, the automatic analysis helped to detect
movements involving the lip area, i.e., lip pucker and lip
parting. In the case of unrecalled items, for delay and high
intonation, the FOKs were higher when the nonverbal
feature was present compared to when it was absent. Even
though the manual labelling did not identify any relevant
visual features, with the help of the automatic analysis we
found the effect of a nose wrinkle and dimpler for
unrecalled items as well, thus adding to the list of FOK
cues.
Finally, we examined how older adults’ FOK is perceived
by third-party judges, by using the Feeling-of-Another’sKnowing (FOAK) paradigm. Ours study showed that
signals of FOK seem to be perceived as such, as the judges
were able to estimate speakers’ FOK correctly. These results
are similar to FOAK studies with younger age groups
(Brennan and Williams, 1993; Krahmer & Swerts, 2005).
To conclude, this study shows that the elderly can be
aware of their memory deficits and display the associated
nonverbal cues in a manner comparable to younger age
groups. Future FOK studies can distinguish between
different functions of the nonverbal cues and their effect on
third-party judgments. In particular, it could be the case that
some expressions are automatic and primarily associated
with the affective (e.g., movements of the lips) and
cognitive states experienced by the participant (e.g., eye
brow movement), while others serve a more communicative
function (e.g., hedges, filled pauses).
