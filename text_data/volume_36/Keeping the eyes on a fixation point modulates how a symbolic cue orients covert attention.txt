   A second experiment was identical but adopted a larger
AoI around the central fixation dot, thus relaxing fixation
control. This modification ensured that participants did not
move their eyes to the target while reducing the amount of
attentional resources necessary to keep the eye on the
fixation dot (see Kingstone & Klein, 1993). According to
the limited capacity view, this should free attentional
resources which could, in principle, be allocated to covert
attention shifts cued by an arrow.
                       Experiment 1
The first experiment aims to investigate whether keeping the
eye on a fixation point interferes with the property of an
arrow to covertly orient attention toward a cued location.

In Experiment 1, a strict control on eye movements and
feedback on fixation errors during a spatial cueing
experiment prevented people from using the arrow to direct
their attention to a cued location. This eliminated the
advantage for valid over invalid trials. In Experiment 2, we
loosened the control on fixation. If the amount of attention
demanded by the tight control on fixation interfered with the
cueing effect, then participants should be able to use the
arrow and therefore we should see faster responses for valid
than invalid trials in Experiment 2. Alternatively, if other
properties of the stimuli or paradigm eliminated the cueing
effect, then we should fail to replicate it.
