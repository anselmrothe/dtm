Abstract

of the paradigm, participants are asked to keep their eye
gaze on a (typically centrally-presented) fixation cross while
they are asked to respond behaviorally to a peripheral target
stimulus to which attention is either cued (e.g., by an arrow
pointing in its direction) or not. Maintaining fixation
ensures that the paradigm elicits covert (rather than overt1)
attention shifts to the peripheral target stimulus. Overall,
results from this paradigm have shown that an attentionally
cued relative to an uncued non-central target stimulus elicits
faster covert attention shifts and response latencies (e.g., in
a binary target discrimination task). We use the spatial cuing
paradigm to investigate the extent to which maintaining
fixation interferes with covert shifts of attention.
Following the idea of limited resources (Kahneman,
1973), performance in covert orienting should be impaired if
participants are engaged in a concurrent resource-taxing
fixation task. This is in line with the studies on covert
attention showing that a central-monitoring task affects the
property of a peripheral cue to attract attention at a short
SOA (Santangelo, Olivetti Belardinelli, & Spence, 2007;
Santangelo, Botta, Lupianez & Spence, 2011).
Despite this evidence, a positive cueing effect (the latency
difference between responding to a target at a cued location
versus an uncued location) emerged even when participants
maintained fixation (e.g., Downing; 1988; Eimer, 1994;
Hawkins, Hillyard, Luck, Mouloua, Downing & Woodward,
1990). One possible explanation is that in these studies,
participants did not receive any feedback on their fixation
behavior during the experiment. In the absence of feedback,
participants may not have been aware of their performance
and they may thus have allocated few resources to
maintaining fixation and instead focused on shifting covert
attention to the cued location, eliciting a cueing effect.
To the extent that this reasoning holds, post-trial feedback
every time participants move their eyes away from the
fixation cross should make fixating more attentiondemanding. Then, according to the limited resources view,
we should observe interference in the cueing task, that is a
reduced cuing effect. On the other hand, if keeping the eyes

Studies on covert attention usually monitor participants’ eye
movements in order to prevent participants from moving their
eyes away from a central fixation point. However, given our
frequently dynamic attention behavior, keeping the gaze on a
fixation point may be effortful and require attentional
resources. If so, then trying to maintain fixation should
interfere with covert attention orienting because both
maintaining fixation and attention orienting require
attentional resources. Here we present two eye tracking
experiments showing that the amount of attentional resources
involved in maintaining fixation affects how an arrow orients
covert attention.

Introduction
It is an interesting fact about visual attention that people can
shift their attention covertly while overtly fixating a central
point (Posner, Snyder, & Davidson, 1980). Studies on
covert attention shifts often instruct participants to fixate a
cross in the middle of the screen while they are engaged in
another task requiring them to shift their attention covertly
away from the cross. However, keeping the eye on a
fixation point goes against the natural tendency to explore
the environment with the eyes (Hermens & Walker, 2010;
Munoz, 2002; Rolfs, 2009). This suggests that maintaining
fixation may involve attentional effort (Dauwels, Vialatte &
Cichocki, 2010). Despite these observations, we so far do
not know whether maintaining fixation does indeed require
attentional resources and how it affects other attentional
processes such as covert attention shifts.

Attentional-based interference
It is well known that attention has limited processing
capacity (Kahneman, 1973) and when engaged in two
concurrent activities (both requiring attentional resources),
interference is observed (Pashler, 1994). Accordingly,
keeping the eye on the fixation cross should interfere with
any attention-demanding task performed simultaneously.
The spatial cuing paradigm is a good example of such a
situation. Introduced by Posner (1980), it has become an
established paradigm in the investigation of covert attention
shifts. In Posner’s classical study, as in more recent variants

Overt attention shifts are accompanied by an eye
movement while ‘covert’ attention shifts are shifts of the
attention focus without a corresponding overt eye
movement.

on the fixation dot does not require attention, or if it does
not interfere with other covert attentional processes, then the
cueing effect in covert attention should be insensitive to the
instruction of maintaining fixation.
We conducted two spatial cueing experiments to
investigate this hypothesis. The spatial cueing paradigm is
well established for investigating covert attention (Müller &
Findley, 1988), and a central arrow robustly orients covert
attention (Gibson & Bryant, 2005; Hommel, Pratt, Colzato
& Godiji, 2001; Ristic, Friesen & Kingstone, 2002; Ristic &
Kingstone, 2006). In the first experiment, participants had to
discriminate a peripheral target as fast as possible while
fixating a central dot for the entire duration of the
experiment. The control on eye movements was obtained by
setting an area of interest (AoI) around the fixation point;
the eye tracker was then programmed to present a feedback
message after each trial in which participants’ eyes had left
that AoI. Given that we made maintaining fixation on the
central dot obligatory via the post-trial feedback, we should
observe a decrease in the cueing of covert attention shifts by
an arrow (to the extent that maintaining fixation interferes
with covert shifts in attention).
A second experiment was identical but adopted a larger
AoI around the central fixation dot, thus relaxing fixation
control. This modification ensured that participants did not
move their eyes to the target while reducing the amount of
attentional resources necessary to keep the eye on the
fixation dot (see Kingstone & Klein, 1993). According to
the limited capacity view, this should free attentional
resources which could, in principle, be allocated to covert
attention shifts cued by an arrow.

Deubel, 1995) subtending 0.7° x 0.7° area. The target letter
could appear in the four cardinal locations around a circle
that subtended 8.8°. The target was presented at 4.6° from
the fixation point. The distractors were the numbers 2, 5 and
9 all subtending the same area as the target. The target and
distractors were pre-masked by an 8-like shape (0.7° x 0.7°).
After removing parts of the 8-like shape, the pre-mask could
become either a number (e.g. 2, 5 or 9) or the target. Neutral
trials presented a circle (subtending 2.6°) instead of an
arrow. All stimuli were black on a white background. The
fixation point (a red cross subtending 0.7° visual degree)
was presented at center display, superimposed to the cue.
Design The combination of two cue types (arrow vs. neutral
circle), cue direction (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°), and target
location (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°), yielded a trial factor with
the levels neutral, valid, and invalid. Valid trials showed the
arrow pointing to the target, invalid trials showed the arrow
pointing to one of the remaining three locations and neutral
trials used a circle as the cue (see Figure 1).

Experiment 1
The first experiment aims to investigate whether keeping the
eye on a fixation point interferes with the property of an
arrow to covertly orient attention toward a cued location.

Figure 1: This schema illustrates the experimental trial
sequence. First a fixation cross was displayed for 800 ms.
Next a “cued” trial or an “uncued” trial could begin. Cued
trials (solid lines) showed an arrow as a cue while trials
showing a circle were encoded as neutral trials (dotted
lines). If the arrow indicates the direction where the target
appears, the trial is ‘valid’. For invalid trials, the arrow
indicates a location where the target does not appear. The
target remained on-screen until a response was recorded or
for a maximum of 3000 ms. Stimuli are not to scale.

Method
Participants 24 participants (6 male and 18 female; age
range = 22-33 years, mean age = 28.7 years) received 6 euro
for participating in the experiment. All had normal or
corrected-to-normal vision and were unfamiliar with the
purpose of the study. All gave informed consent.
Apparatus and Stimuli An the Eyelink 1000 (SR research
Ltd. Ontario, Canada) monitored eye gaze at a frequency of
1000 Hz. The experiment was presented via the Experiment
Builder program (SR research Ltd. Ontario, Canada). A 22’,
120Hz, 1680 x 1050 pixel resolution Samsung monitor was
used to show the stimuli. This monitor and its high
frequency guaranteed a reliable and accurate presentation
time (Wang & Nikolic, 2011). Participants sat
approximately 85 cm from the screen and their head rested
on a chin rest. Responses were collected via a Cedrus RB834 response box, providing an accuracy of +- 1 msec.
A simple arrow subtending 2.6° served as a central cue.
The target was an “E” or a mirror “E” (see Schneider &

A second factor was stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) with
two levels (short vs. long; short = random duration between
80 and 120 ms vs. long = between 450 and 550 ms). We
used these times according to the evidence that stronger
cueing effect is reached around 600 ms and the worst at
about 100 ms SOA (e.g., Ristic & Kingstone, 2006 but c.f.
Müller & Rabbitt, 1989; see also Chica, Lupianez &
Bartolomeo, 2006). Finally we included block as a factor to
verify that there is no learning effect (i.e., an increase of the
cueing effect across blocks).

Participants saw each trial four times, totaling 512 trials
per participant (64 valid, 192 invalid and 256 neutral). The
percentage of valid trials was 25% (so that the arrow cue
was not predictive given that invalid trials covered the
remaining 75% of all cued trials). The number of neutral
trials (uncued) was balanced with the number of cued trials.
Participants were not informed about cue validity. It has
been argued that an arrow orients attention automatically
(Galfano, Dalmaso, Marzoli, Pavan, Coricelli & Castelli,
2012; Kingstone, Smilek, Ristic, Friesen, & Eastwood,
2003; Kuhn & Kingstone, 2009; Peterson & Gibson, 2011;
Pratt, Radulescu, Guo & Hommel, 2010; Ristic, Friesen &
Kingstone, 2002; Tipples, 2002), meaning that how often it
points to the target should not modulate the cueing effect.

neutral trials (M = 744 ms; SD = 28 ms than in valid trials
(M = 764 ms; SD = 31 difference = 20.6 ms, see Figure 2),
and descriptively valid trials were responded to faster than
invalid trials (p > 0.4). The interaction between cue type
and SOA was marginally significant, F(2,40) = 2.6, p =
.087) but the post-hoc tests revealed no difference between
valid and invalid trials in the two SOA types. A significant
main effect of block also emerged, F(3,60) = 23.51, p <
.0001, with slower responses in the first than fourth block
(129 ms). No other effects were significant (ps > .4).

deviations for the main effects in Experiment 1 and 2.
Experiment 1
Block

Procedure All participants signed an informed consent
form and received instructions about the experiment. Then
the eye tracker was calibrated via a 9-point calibration
procedure. Before the experiment began, participants
received 16 practice trials. Figure 1 illustrates the sequence
of events. All trials began with a fixation point inside a
circle and 4 masks. After 800 ms, either an uncued trial
(with a circle) or a cued trial (with an arrow) was presented.
The cue remained on the screen for a variable time
depending on the SOA (short or long). Afterwards the
masks were modified revealing one target and 3 distractors.
The target was displayed for a maximum of 3000 ms or
until the participant pressed a response button. Latencies
were measured from target onset.
The inter-trial interval lasted 1200 ms. An AoI of 3.5° x
3.5° was set around the fixation cross. Its size was big
enough to include the arrow cue. When an eye movement
was detected outside the AoI, a message was displayed
(“The eye tracker has detected that you moved your eyes
away from the fixation point. Please try to always fixate the
central red cross”) and the trial was interrupted. The full
experiment lasted about 45-50 minutes including 10 short
breaks. Participants were re-calibrated after each break.

Discussion
The analyses for Experiment 1 converged in showing that
the arrow did not automatically orient participants’ attention
towards the target location. Thus, making the fixation task
demanding (by applying a tight control on eye movements
and providing post-trial feedback on fixation performance),
eliminated the cueing benefit reported in literature (c.f.
Ristic, Friesen, & Kingstone, 2002). Indeed, if anything
invalid trials were responded to faster than valid trials
although this comparison was not reliable. Neutral trials
elicited reliably faster responses than valid trials, but this
can be explained in terms of cue validity. It is possible that
participants used neutral trials efficiently because the circles
distributed attention to all the potential target locations.
The fact that three participants failed to maintain fixation
within the small area around the fixation dot for more than
20% of the trials, suggests that the task was difficult. This
between-subject variation further suggests that keeping the
eye on a central fixation dot requires attentional effort
(Neuman, 1984, but c.f. Logan 1998). The remaining

Analysis and Results
Reaction time analysis Three participants were excluded
from the analysis because they failed to keep their eyes on
the fixation point in more than 20% of the trials. For the
remaining 21 participants, trials with latencies below 200
ms (14 = 0.13%), trials where participant moved their eyes
(729 = 6.8%), and trials for which an incorrect response was
given (305 = 2.8%) were excluded. In order to eliminate
outliers (460 trials = 5% eliminated), we filtered the reaction
times by 2 SD (calculated for each condition and for each
participant). The cleaned data was analyzed using a
repeated-measures ANOVA with three factors: 2 (SOAs) x
3 (trial type) x block (1-4). The latter factor was included to
verify changes in the cueing effect across blocks (see
Methods). Trial type levels were valid, invalid and neutral,
and SOA levels were short vs. long (see Figure 1).
The 3-way ANOVA, F(2,40) = 6.66, p < .01, revealed a
main effect of trial type that came from faster responses in

280

participants failed to maintain fixation on about 7% of the
trials (c.f. Galfano et al. 2012).
The main effect of block replicated previous results
showing a decrease in response times over the course of the
experiment. The lack of a significant interaction between
block and trial type again suggested that practice did not
affect the effect of trial type. The marginal interaction of
trial type and SOA seems to stem from a decrease in
reaction time at the long (vs. short) SOA within invalid
trials. At the short SOA, the target appeared after 80-120 ms
after cue onset, a point at which participants’ attention may
still have been focused on the (cued but often incorrect)
location, thus slowing target-onset time-locked response
times. With the long SOA, participants had around 400 ms
extra between cue and target onset to attend to all four
locations, arguably speeding up their target discrimination
time once the target appeared.
In summary, a tight control on eye movements prevents
participants from using the arrow to automatically guide
attention. If maintaining fixation takes away attention
resources necessary for the positive cueing effect to emerge,
then the cueing effect should reappear if we make the
fixation task less demanding. Experiment 2 investigated this
hypothesis by using a looser fixation control.

2.7°) but triggered feedback if the eyes moved to the target
(which was located at 4.6° from the fixation point).

Analysis and Results
Reaction time analysis As for Experiment 1, we eliminated
trials with latencies below 200 ms (59 = 1%), trials with eye
movements (865 = 8.9%) and trials with an incorrect
response (318 = 3.3%). In order to exclude outliers, reaction
times were filtered (2 SD for each participant by condition)
eliminating 430 trials (5%).
As for Experiment 1 we conducted an ANOVA including
block, SOA and cue type as factors. The 3-way ANOVA
revealed a significant main effect of trial type, F(2,36) =
3.44, p < .05. Crucially and unlike in Experiment 1, follow
up analyses (Scheffé) showed a significant advantage for
valid trials (M = 710 ms; SD = 28 ms) compared to invalid
(M = 740 ms; SD = 37 ms) trials (see Figure 2). No other
comparisons were significant (all remaining ps > .1). We
also replicated the significant main effect of block, F(3,54)
= 11.03, p < .0001, with slower responses for the first (M =
791 ms; SD = 45 ms) than the last (M= 671; SD = 22 ms)
block. The analysis also found a significant interaction,
between block and trial type, F(6,108) = 2.23, p < .05, with
a significant advantage for valid trials compared to invalid
trials in block 1 (p < .0001) and block 2 (p < .05), but not in
block 3 and 4.

Experiment 2
In Experiment 1, a strict control on eye movements and
feedback on fixation errors during a spatial cueing
experiment prevented people from using the arrow to direct
their attention to a cued location. This eliminated the
advantage for valid over invalid trials. In Experiment 2, we
loosened the control on fixation. If the amount of attention
demanded by the tight control on fixation interfered with the
cueing effect, then participants should be able to use the
arrow and therefore we should see faster responses for valid
than invalid trials in Experiment 2. Alternatively, if other
properties of the stimuli or paradigm eliminated the cueing
effect, then we should fail to replicate it.

Method

Participants 19 further native German speakers (6 male
and 13 female; age range = 20-29 years, mean age = 23
years) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision
participated in this study. All participants were naïve to the
purpose of the study and gave informed consent in
accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Each
participant was paid 6 euro for participation.

The principal difference between Experiment 1 and
Experiment 2 consisted in using a larger AoI to monitor the
eye movements in Experiment 2. In doing this, it was then
possible that people moved their eyes closer to the target
(but still not on the target). This would have brought a
visual advantage. In order to exclude this interpretation, we
ran a new analysis excluding (post-hoc) trials in which
people moved their eye away from the fixation point
(detected by setting a new 0.7° x 0.7° area which was just
about the same size as the fixation cross) but still within the
monitored perimeter (9° x 9°). This analysis found that
people moved their eyes outside this small area on 9.4% of
the trials but an ANOVA including only trials where people

Material, Design and Procedure This experiment used the
same materials, design and procedure as Experiment 1. The
only difference concerns the use of a looser control on the
eye movements. This was obtained by using a larger AoI (9°
x 9°) compared to the one used in Experiment 1 (3.5° x
3.5°). The dimension of this area allowed eye movements

should emerge when cue validity is high and fixation
control is strict. Another follow-up study using peripheral
cues (abrupt onset) would provide insight into whether
maintaining the eyes on the fixation dot affects also
exogenous attention.
More broadly, the results from Experiments 1 and 2 are
interesting in relation to the so-called gap effect (Braun &
Breitmeyer, 1988; Fischer & Boch, 1983; Fischer &
Ramsperger, 1984). According to the attentional predisengagement theory (APT, Fischer & Breitmeyer, 1987),
removing the fixation dot disengages attention, facilitating
attentional shifts elsewhere (Kingstone & Klein, 1993). In
our experiments the fixation dot was never removed,
ensuring that people attended to it. However, in Experiment
2, fixation control was lax, meaning less attentional
resources were engaged at the dot, and more were available
for covert shifts to the target. It will be interesting to see
whether removing the fixation dot during a trial would elicit
the same pattern as the overall laxer fixation control in
Experiment 2. Another possible avenue for future research
is to compare attention allocation and the cueing effect in a
task which - unlike the fixation-task - does not engage
spatial attention (e.g., mental arithmetic).
While these are exciting research possibilities, what we
have shown here is that the attentional resources involved in
maintaining fixation affect the property of a non-predictive
cue to orient covert attention. Experiment 1 has provided
evidence that when central fixation control was (spatially)
strict, an arrow to a peripheral did not elicit a cueing effect.
However, when maintaining fixation required less
attentional resources (using a laxer spatial control on eye
movements) the non-predictive arrow elicited a cuing effect.

Discussion
We investigated whether reducing the attentional effort
involved in fixating the fixation cross would reproduce the
response time advantage for valid over invalid trials. The
results corroborate our hypothesis in that with a looser
control on eye movements, the responses to valid trials were
significantly faster than the responses to invalid trials.
As in Experiment 1, the block effect suggested that
participants improved with practice. The interaction
between block and trial type indicated that such
improvement concerns only the first two blocks, which
likely reflects that spatial orienting in target discrimination
(while maintaining fixation) is modulated by practice.

General Discussion
The distinction between covert and overt attention lies in the
role of eye movements: While covert attention shifts occur
without eye movements, an overt attention shift is
accompanied by an eye movement. In studies on covert
attention participants have been asked to keep their eyes on
a central fixation dot, ensuring that covert attention was
tested. But keeping the eyes on a specific point is not a
natural behavior, and it has been suggested that fixation
control requires attention. If so, then the limited capacity
hypothesis predicts that fewer attentional resources should
be available for covert attention shifts to a non-central target
when people are instructed to maintain central fixation.
The results from Experiment 1 revealed similar response
times for valid (i.e., cued) and invalid trials when
participants maintained fixation (a) under a tight spatial
control on eye movements (a narrow perimeter) and (b)
when online feedback alerted them if they moved their eye
outside the perimeter. By contrast, in Experiment 2, when a
laxer fixation control meant that fixating the central dot
required less attentional resources, we did observe an
advantage for valid over invalid trials.
We believe these findings are relevant for anyone
interested in covert attention, given that often in such
paradigms a spatial cueing task is associated with the
instruction to maintain central fixation. However, these two
experiments do not clarify whether the attentional resources
engaged in keeping the eye on the fixation dot affected only
reflexive shifts in covert attention or also voluntary shifts.
We are currently testing this hypothesis by running a study
where we keep a tight control on eye movements but
increase the cue validity from 25% to 75%. We expect this
manipulation will make the direction of the cue predictive,
providing participants with an incentive to voluntarily shift
attention in the cued direction (Jonides, 1981; Posner,
1980). If keeping the eye on the fixation affects only
reflexive covert attention shifts, a positive cueing effect
