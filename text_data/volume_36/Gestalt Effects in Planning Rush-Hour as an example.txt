   Planning problems have been extensively studied with regard
   to graph theoretical properties such as the number of steps nec-
   essary to reach a specific goal state or the size of the problem
   space. These structural properties, however, do not completely
   characterize a problem. In the presented eye-tracking study
   we also investigated the influence of perceptual factors on the
   solution to a planning problem. While not affecting the cor-
   rectness of a solution, the results suggest that certain Gestalt
   properties are responsible for the deviation from optimal plans.

Planning problems can be characterized by structural proper-

goal state or the size of the problem space, and perceptual

   It is well known that humans tend to solve computation-
ally complex problems by chunking information in order to
simplify the problem’s representation (Ellis & Siegler, 1994;
Kotovsky, Hayes, & Simon, 1985; Ohlsson, 1992).
   Both explanations seem to be cognitively plausible because
both remove some amount of complexity from the game. The
Gestalt strategy reduces the number of vehicles that partici-
pants must consider to plan the solution by grouping them as           Figure 6: The importance of Gestalt in planning. The images

hand, the longest move strategy reduces the complexity due to
distance calculations; participants do not need to check prior
to every move if the space in the direction in which the vehicle
has to be moved is enough to unblock the previous one in the
move sequence. Participants can assume that, once a vehicle
reaches the border in the other half of the board, the previous
one will be automatically unblocked. The two theories lead
to the same result and are difficult to distinguish from one
another while observing participants performing the experi-
ment. We have found evidence to support both theories, so
we cannot say conclusively which one is correct.
