Experiment 2 was designed to control for the possibility that
the Motor task is more demanding than the Control
secondary task. Rather than making beat perception
judgments for their primary task, participants made
judgments about the pitch of musical tones, which involves
auditory processing regions of the brain, but is not thought
to involve the motor system in the same manner as beat
perception (see Peretz & Zatorre, 2005, for a review). If
