perspective on condition is between 1.5 and 1.2 percent.
We also analyzed initiation latency, reaction times and
maximum deviation to examine our hypotheses. However,
we began with replicating former findings, when
individuals saw Condition 2, as shown in Figure 2,
participants took the other perspective more often than they
did in Condition 1, as reported in this regression, b = 1.53,
t(2215) = 139.93, p < .001. Perspective also explained a

facing them in the scene, as shown in Figure 2, regardless
of which perspective they chose, initiation times were
about the same, (egocentric: M = 1470.30, SD = 1273.72;
other centric: M = 1527.30, SD = 1205.65). However,
when there was no person facing them as shown in Figure
