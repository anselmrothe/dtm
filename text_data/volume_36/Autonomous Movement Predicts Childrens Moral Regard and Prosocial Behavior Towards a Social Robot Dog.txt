  Therefore, as indicated through both forced choice and
explanatory responses, children ascribed higher physical
and emotional sentience as well as endorsed the robot as
having desires, emotions, and basic physiological properties
when the robot was autonomous.
Moral Standing
  Our next question concerned whether children would be
more likely to endorse moral standing for an autonomously
moving robot dog.
