   Inductive generalization is ubiquitous in human cognition;
                                                                       Instead, children are “initially biased” to recognize that
   however, the factors underpinning this ability early in             labels denote categories and make inferences on the basis of
   development remain contested. Two alternative perspectives          shared category membership (Gelman & Markman, 1986, p.
