Abstract
The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is increasingly employed to
measure the tendency of an individual to override a prepotent but
incorrect response and to subsequently engage in further reflection.
This interplay between fast intuitive responding and resource
demanding reflection has been offered as a paradigmatic example
of dual process theories of thinking. Despite its growing popularity
both for dual process theories and as an easily deployed measure of
intelligence, the basic assumption that the CRT relies on executive
resources remains generally circumstantial. The present study
directly tested these dual process assumptions by presenting the
standard bat-and-ball problem and a no-conflict control version
while manipulating executive resources with a secondary load task.
With the no-conflict control problems, accuracy was uniformly at
ceiling in no load, low load, and high load conditions. In sharp
contrast, in the standard conflict problems accuracy clearly
declined with increasingly load. These findings validate dual
process assumptions by providing direct causal evidence that
correctly resolving the bat-and-ball problem draws on executive
resources.

Introduction
In the face of difficulty, human reasoners often appear to
forego the effortful processing that may be required and opt
instead for less demanding intuitive responses (Kahneman,
2011). While many fast and frugal heuristics are no doubt
adaptive in complex and reoccurring environments
(Gigerenzer, 2007), thinking fast can also lead to quite
embarrassingly erroneous responses in less routine settings.
Quickly consider the following example:
A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more
than the ball. How much does the ball cost?

Intuitively, the answer “10 cents” quickly springs to mind.
In fact, typically around 80% of university students,
including those from elite schools such as MIT and Harvard,

respond with this intuitive—but incorrect—answer (e.g.
Bourgeois-Gironde & Vanderhenst, 2009; Frederick, 2005).
If the bat costs $1 more than a 10-cent ball, the bat itself
must cost $1.10. Summing up, a $1.10 bat + a $0.10 ball
would equal $1.20, not $1.10 as stated in the problem. Does
this imply that highly educated young adults think that ‘110
+ 10’ = ‘110’? Of course not. Rather, it suggests that even
educated reasoners often do not invest the necessary effort
to correct their initial intuition, and instead settle for a
quickly derived response.
The above bat-and-ball problem1 is extremely popular
amongst researchers, and extremely difficult for
participants. This popularity and difficulty are highly
intertwined. First, high correlations are often observed
between performance on this problem and other measures of
intelligence or cognitive capacity, making it a tempting
short alternative to more cumbersome measures such as
standard IQ or working memory tests (Toplak, West,
Stanovich, 2011). Second, like many traditional judgment
and reasoning tasks arising out the heuristics-and-biases era,
the above bat-and-ball problem is a paradigmatic example
of a situation whose initially primed response is incorrect
and which therefore must be overridden in order to correctly
solve the task.
This latter point has made the bat-and-ball problem
particularly attractive for dual process theories of thinking
and reasoning (Kahneman, 2011; Kahneman & Frederick,
2002; Thompson, 2009). According to dual processes
theories, human reasoning is characterized by two systems,
or processing types, which respond to encountered
information in different ways. A first intuitive type thinking
(System 1) automatically triggers responses based on prior
knowledge/beliefs or via a number of simplifying heuristics,
whereas a second more deliberate type (System 2) demands
the more controlled utilization of limited executive
resources.

The bat-and-ball problem, together with two other items, forms
part of the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005). For
a recently extended test, see Toplak, West & Stanovich (2013).

The bat-and-ball problem has captured the attention of
researchers working within dual process frameworks
precisely because such a strongly compelling but wrong
answer jumps to mind so quickly. In order to correctly
solve the problem, one must first detect that something is
amiss with the rapid, compelling response provided by
System 1. In principle, this takes little more than a simple
check: “Wait a minute, if the ball costs 10 cents, then the
bat costs $1.10… that can’t be right!”. Once the conflict is
detected, this erroneous intuition can then be overridden
with the more effortful engagement of System 2.
Although it is widely assumed that correctly solving the
bat-and-ball problem draws on the limited executive
resources of System 2, no direct evidence has been
presented to validate this claim. So far, this idea is based
primarily on correlational data demonstrating the above
mentioned relationships between CRT performance and
other measures of cognitive capacity (e.g. Aguilar, Johnson
& Tubau, 2014; Cokely & Kelley, 2009; Lesage, Navarrete,
& De Neys, 2012; Liberali et al, 2011). This is particularly
troublesome, especially given the variety of criticism aimed
at dual process frameworks (see e.g. De Neys, 2006a;
2006b; Evans & Stanovich, 2013; Gigerenzer & Regier,
1996; Keren & Schul, 2009).
In the present study we tested this central dual process
claim by experimentally limiting executive resources with a
dual-task paradigm. Dual process theorists claim that
cognitive load should place differential burdens on effortful
and intuitive processing (Evans, 2008; Evans & Stanovich,
2013; Sloman, 1996; Stanovich & West, 2000). If the batand-ball problem does indeed inextricably depend on the
availability of executive resources, then performance on this
task should decrease under cognitive load (for further
discussion see De Neys, 2006a, 2006b).
As a crucial counterpoint, we also presented the following
no-conflict control version of the bat-and-ball problem:
A magazine and a banana together cost $2.90. The
magazine costs $2. How much does the banana cost?

On this control version the rapidly cued intuitive response
(“90 cents”) does not conflict with other normative
considerations, and therefore no inhibition of an erroneous
prepotent response is required. De Neys, Rossi, and Houdé
(2013) demonstrated very high accuracy on this control
problem when presented as a simple reasoning task without
additional load manipulations. Crucial for the automaticity
assumption in dual process theories, accuracy should not
decline on these no-conflict problems in the presence of the
additional cognitive burden. Accordingly, this problem
helps to restrain interpretations of any observed decline in
accuracy under load in the standard bat-and-ball problem.
For example, if burdening cognitive capacity simply reduces
general resources which may be required for reading,
comprehending, and responding in an experimental setting,
then a corresponding decline in performance should also be
observed on the control problem. If, however, it is the need
to overcome the rapidly available intuitive response on the

standard conflict problems which draws on cognitive
resources, then no performance decline should be observed
under cognitive load on the control problems.

Experiment
Method & Material
Participants. A total of 190 undergraduate students from
the University of Barcelona were recruited for this task in
exchange for course credit. Seven of these students reported
being familiar with the bat-and-ball problem, and therefore
only data from the remaining 183 participants (mean age =
20.46, SE=.23) was analyzed and reported here.
Reasoning Task. The reasoning tasks included both a
standard conflict and a no-conflict control version of the
bat-and-ball problem introduced above. As in previous
work (De Neys et al, 2013), different contextual and
numerical contents were used (see Appendix). One problem
presented a bat and ball, the other presented a magazine and
banana. In one problem the total cost was $1.10 with one
item costing $1 more than the other; in the other problem
the total cost was $2.90 with one item costing $2 more than
the other. Item contents and values for the conflict and
control versions were fully counterbalanced across
participants, which helps to ensure that any observed effects
are general and not driven by the specific material used (e.g.
the ease of partitioning 1.10 and 10, or background beliefs
about the price of specific items)2. A blank box with the
label “cents” appeared on screen following the problem.
Participants therefore typed only their numerical response
into the box.
Load Task: Dot Memory. In the load conditions, participants
were presented a secondary visuospatial storage task (De
Neys, 2006a; Franssens & De Neys, 2009). Prior to the
reasoning task, a pattern of dots was briefly presented
(900ms) in a 3 x 3 grid for participants to memorize and
keep in mind while reasoning. After the reasoning task,
participants were subsequently presented a blank grid into
which they clicked with the mouse to reproduce the
remembered pattern (an indicated dot could be removed by
clicking again). Two load conditions were used in the
present study. In the high load (HL) condition, four dots
were presented in a complex interspersed pattern, which has
been established to interfere specifically with effortdemanding executive resources (Miyake et al, 2001). In the
low load (LL) condition, three dots were presented in a
single column, which should place only a minimal burden
on executive resources (De Neys, 2006a; De Neys &
Verschueren, 2006; see examples in Figure 1).

None of these factors had any impact on performance.

the (A) Low Load condition, and (B) High Load condition.

Procedure. All tasks were adapted for computer-based
testing. Participants were tested in small groups (up to four
at a time) at individual computer terminals. All participants
were randomized to receive the standard conflict (n=93) or
the no-conflict control (n=90) problem in one of the three
load conditions (HL, LL, NL).
Appropriate task
instructions were provided, along with a brief practice series
to familiarize them with the testing environment, explained
as follows.
In the (high and low) load conditions, participants first
saw a simple and unrelated math story problem where they
were to provide a single numerical response and press the
Enter key. This was followed by a new screen with
instructions explaining that they would also have to
memorize a dot pattern to subsequently reproduce after the
reasoning task. Participants then practiced the entire series:
A pattern was briefly flashed for 900ms, followed by the
same simple practice problem, and finally a blank grid
appeared for participants to reproduce the previously seen
dot pattern. As part of another study, prior to the appearance
of the blank grid participants were also asked to provide a
confidence judgment regarding the correctness of their
response. The procedure was the same in the no load group,
but without any mention or practice of the dot pattern task.
Following the practice series the actual experiment began.

Results & Discussion
Load Task. On average, in the 3-dot low load condition
participants correctly indicated 98% (2.95, SD=0.38) of the
dot locations on the conflict problems and 100% (3.00,
SD=0.00) of the dots on the control versions. In the 4-dot
high load condition, 86% (3.42, SD=0.94) of the dot
locations on the conflict problems and 85% (3.38, SD=0.79)
of the dots on the control versions were correctly indicated.
This shows that the secondary task was performed properly.
There was no correlation between participants scores on the
dot recall and reasoning task in the low load (r=.053, p=.68)
or high load (r=.058, p=.65) conditions, which indicates that
there was no performance trade-off between these tasks.
Accuracy. As expected, response accuracy was very high
on the control problems in the no load (97%, SE=3.2%), low

load (100%, SE=0.0%), and high load (100%, SE=0.0%)
conditions.
A logistic regression confirmed that
performance was clearly not affected by executive load on
these no-conflict problems (χ²(1)<1, p>.95). This establishes
that the intuitive, and correct, response in the control version
was automatically triggered with minimal involvement of
executive resources.
In sharp contrast, on the standard conflict versions a clear
decline in correct responses was observed with increasing
load, from 23% (SE=8.4%) with no load, to 16% (SE=6.1%)
with low load, to 3% (SE=3.3%) under high load (Figure 2).
Logistic regression revealed that this effect of load on
accuracy was significant (χ² (1)=4.25, p=.039, eβ=.41, 95%
C.I.=.18 – .96). This finding provides direct causal evidence
for the typically assumed claim the CRT bat-and-ball
problem draws on executive resources.

under no load (NL), low load (LL), and high load (HL). Error bars
are standard errors.

The response accuracy on the standard conflict problems
in the no load condition (23%) is in line with previous
studies (e.g. De Neys et al, 2013), demonstrating that
performance was not generally influenced by the computerbased testing environment. Further analysis of erroneous
responses showed that 95% (19/20) of biased reasoners
provided the intuitive “10 cents” response in the absence of
load. Importantly, this same high proportion of intuitively
cued incorrect responses was observed under low (97%;
30/31) and high (93%; 27/29) loads, confirming that the
presence of a demanding executive task does not simply
lead to increased guessing or otherwise random responding3.
It might be argued that the decrease in accuracy under
load results not from increased demands on reasoning
processes per se, but rather from the effect of load on
reading or comprehension process, which are also known to
draw on executive resources (Just, Carpenter, & Keller,
1996). This interpretation is ruled out, however, by the
uniformly high accuracy on the no-conflict problems
3
To be clear, the overall number of erroneous responses
increased under load. The point here is simply that in all
conditions the erroneous responses are not random but specifically
entail the postulated intuitively cued “10 cents” response.

regardless of executive burden. This establishes that the
observed effect of load on the standard bat-and-ball problem
resulted specifically from the deployment of executive
resources required to overcome the strongly compelling
intuition.

General Discussion
The bat-and-ball problem has become a centerpiece for
dual process theories of thinking (Bourgeois-Gironde &
Vanderhenst, 2009; Kahneman, 2011; Thompson, 2009).
The principle assumption is that an intuitive but incorrect
answer (10 cents) is delivered via System 1 processing, with
the intervention of System 2 required to override the
erroneous intuition with correct reasoning. According to
dual process theory, the quintessential difference between
these two types of processing is the differential involvement
of executive working memory (Evans, 2008; Evans &
Stanovich, 2013; Stanovich, 2000). It is therefore essential
for this theory to demonstrate that correctly solving the batand-ball problem does indeed draw on this limited executive
resource pool.
Results of the reported experiment validate this dualprocess assumption by experimentally manipulating the
availability of executive resources while participants solved
the bat-and-ball problem. When the intuitive response
corresponded to the correct response in the control problem,
accuracy was nearly perfect. Importantly, performance
remained at ceiling under both low and high load
conditions, confirming the basic assumption that the fastacting System 1 intuition is triggered independently of
executive involvement. In sharp contrast, a clear decline in
accuracy was observed with increasing load on the standard
problem which required the override of the erroneously
cued response. This is all the more remarkable given that
performance in the absence of load is already so low. When
executive resources were burdened with the secondary task
of maintaining and recalling a complex dot pattern, only a
single person out of 30 was able to correctly solve the batand-ball problem. This pattern of results empirically
confirms the direct involvement of executive working
memory in the bat-and-ball problem, a suggestion supported
previously by correlational evidence only.
Although dual process theories continue to gain in
popularity across the social and psychological sciences, they
have also received their fair share of criticism (see Evans &
Stanovich, 2013). Many of these views offer unimodal or
alternative approaches that may be more appealing for a
variety of reasons. To be clear, the demonstrated load effect
on the bat-and-ball problem does not in and of itself imply
that dual process theories are indeed correct. Unimodal or
other pluralistic models might also entail that the CRT
draws on executive resources, however, the specific
involvement of executive resources on conflict problems is
a clear, a priori assumption of the general dual process
model. Our results directly show that this assumption is

warranted. In brief, the present study validates a key
assumption of dual process theories, however, it clearly
does not by itself argue against alternative frameworks.
Our findings validate the involvement of executive
resources on the bat-and-ball problem, but they also raise
additional questions regarding the nature of this
involvement on these conflict problems. That is, it is not
clear which component(s) of the bat-and-ball problemsolving process demand executive resources (see De Neys
& Bonnefon, 2013). Recent work by De Neys, Rossi, and
Houdé (2013) established that, in the absence of a secondary
load, even incorrect reasoners were not completely
oblivious to their erroneous response. In that study,
reasoners who went with their intuition on the bat-and-ball
problem expressed less confidence in their invalid response
relative to confidence expressed on the no-conflict control
version.
The fact that even incorrect responders
demonstrated some awareness that their response was not
fully warranted suggests that conflict detection is not the
primary difficulty of the problem. Other dual-task studies
have indeed shown that conflict detection can operate
independently of executive resources on a variety of
judgment and reasoning tasks (e.g. De Neys, 2006;
Franssens & De Neys, 2009). Nevertheless, this does not in
and of itself establish that executive resources are not
implicated in the detection of conflict on the bat-and-ball
problem.
Of course even if reasoners detect the conflict in the
problem and are in principle aware that the intuitive
response must be inhibited/overridden, this does not imply
that they still have the relevant knowledge or capacity to
derive the correct response. While it is probably safe to
assume that all university students can easily add 110 + 10,
that does not entail that they can all set up the appropriate
algebraic representation (x + (x + 1) = 1.10) from a reading
of the bat-and-ball problem. Even if this knowledge is
generally present in a student population, the additional
cognitive load may impinge on the accessibility of this
knowledge. An alternative strategy for solving this problem
may be trial-and-error, adjusting the intuitive response (10
cents) little by little until an acceptable answer is found.
This method of adjusting and checking also likely draws on
executive resources and could account for the reduced
performance observed under high load.
In short, the load effect observed in the present study
could result from an additional burden on the retrieval of
relevant knowledge, the conflict detection process, or the
ability to inhibit/override the intuitive response and supplant
it with a correct one. While this refinement remains for
future research, the present study establishes that at
whatever stage the trouble lies, successfully overcoming this
difficulty depends on executive working memory resources.
This executive involvement in the face of conflict, along
with the automaticity of the intuitive control response,
validates a key assumption of the dual process framework.
