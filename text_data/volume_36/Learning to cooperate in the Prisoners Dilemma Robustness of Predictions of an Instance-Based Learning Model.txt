  Figure 3 shows the average proportion of cooperation
resulting from the IBL-PD model’s predictions and the
proportion of cooperation reported in the RC65
experiments, to test Hypothesis 1. In agreement with the
RC65 results, the IBL-PD model predicts that as the reward
for cooperation (CC cell) goes from 1 to 5 to 9 (while all
other payoffs stay the same), the proportion of cooperation
increases.

cooperation from Game IV to Game III, but not a decrease
from Game III to Game V. The higher cooperation in Game
IV compared to the other games may be explained by the
relative small advantage for cooperation over defection in
this game (T-R=1), compared to the Games III and V where               Figure 5. Average proportion of cooperation resulting from the

that the most beneficial decision is to cooperate; and the
proportion of cooperation reaches about 80% in less than 50
trials, then ultimately to about 100% within 100 trials. In
contrast, the higher temptation values in Games III and V
(T=10 and 50, respectively), compared to the reward from
cooperation in both of these games (R=1), leads to an initial
decrease in the proportion of cooperation. This initial dent is
deeper in Game V than in Game III. However, as observed
in the dynamics, the increase towards cooperation after the
initial decrease occurs faster for Game V than for Game III.

Game V is higher than in Game III. As suggested before, the
