It assumes the hippocampus to “teach” the cortex a memory
trace strengthening the connectivity between its individual el-

   Recently Yassa and Reagh (2013) have proposed a Com-

MTT. It suggests that when a memory is reactivated by a new                                                                         time

is created and ready to be stored in the neocortex. However,                                                  from the working memory
in contrast to MTT, CTT supposes that the memory traces are                                                   to the declarative memory

tion and decontextualization. First, overlapping features in
the memories should not compete for representation and thus
are strengthened, i.e., consolidated. Second, non-overlapping
features should compete with one another resulting in mutual
inhibition and, as a result, memories become decontextual-
ized. Nadel and Moscovitch (1998) proposed the reactivation
of memory traces to strengthen also the links between the
traces too. The concept of such a multi-trace consolidation
can be regarded as the fourth postulate of the ACT-R theory.
   As the fifth postulate we note the following. The hip-
pocampus is involved in the “reconstruction” rather than the
“retrieval” of the memory. So, as CTT states, new memory

Figure 3: Some results of numerical simulation. First, it is the dynamics of forgetting (I) and learning (II) under the “basic”
conditions when a subject learns an unknown information continuously until he gets the local (temporal) success in time TL .
Second, it is the spacing effects in discontinuous learning (IIIa) and the following forgetting (IIIb). In this case the subject
learns an unknown information via a sequence of trials of a fixed duration until he gets the final success at a certain moment of
time TL . Naturally, the longer the time spacing between two successive trials, the larger the number NL of trials and the longer
the total time interval TL are necessary for this. In simulations the following parameters ε = 0.01, α = 0.5, β = 0.1, Fc = 0.95,
dt = 0.001, and TL |d=0.2 = 1.70, TL |d=0.5 = 1.52 were used as a common setup, the other individual values are shown in the
corresponding plots.
