they learned, and ii) if they were in a priming condition,
what they thought the experiment was about.
Results: No participant made an explicit connection

when asked the second debriefing question. One
participant did respond with “maybe something to do

that the affiliated lab conducts eye-tracking work.
While he did not make a connection between the prime
