    The Modularity of Mind Revisited
        Abstract:
           I revisit Fodor’s (1983) notion of “module” and defend it against views weakening the criteria
           to consider a process modular. Many approaches to modularity (e.g., Barrett & Kurzban’s,
           Carruthers’, Cosmides & Tooby’s, and others) are unsatisfying because the notion put forward
           is uninformative. I will explain why we should understand Fodor’s notion of module as
           identifying a homeostatic property cluster (cf. Boyd, 1991). This account should be integrated
           within a broader view of cognition.
