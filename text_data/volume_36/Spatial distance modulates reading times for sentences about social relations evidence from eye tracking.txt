Data Analysis We removed fixations < 80 ms and > 1200
ms before computing reading measures (see, e.g., Sturt,
Keller, & Dubey, 2010). We report three reading measures
for critical sentence regions. First-pass reading times (the
duration of all fixations from first entering an interest area
and prior to moving to another interest area); regression path
duration (the time from first entering a region until moving
past that region to the right, including reading time after
regressions out of the region); and total reading times (the                 Figure 2: Mean first-pass reading time (on the left) and
