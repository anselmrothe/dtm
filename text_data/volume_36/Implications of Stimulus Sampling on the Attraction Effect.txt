   In conclusion, the attraction effect continues to be an
important phenomenon both experimentally and as a tool to
further theoretical undertakings. While tackling the question
of how stimuli generation can impact choice probability
estimation, a condition called the sum-highest property was
introduced, and it was shown that this property is not
desirable for the purpose of investigating the presence of the
attraction effect. Additionally, the sum-highest property is
interesting in and by itself, providing an insight into the
decision process.
