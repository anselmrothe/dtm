                           Introduction
   In this paper, we attempt to reconcile seemingly
incompatible data (Barth & Paladino, 2011; Opfer &
Siegler, 2007; Opfer, Siegler, & Young, 2011; Slusser,
Santiago, & Barth, 2012) regarding the psychophysical
functions that link numbers to children's estimates of
numerical magnitude.
   The psychophysical functions that link numbers to
subjects' estimates of numerical magnitude are both
theoretically and practically important. Of theoretical
interest, the functions generating young children's numerical
magnitude estimates have been observed in the non-
symbolic number discrimination of a wide range of species
(for review, see Nieder and Dehaene, 2009), to change
abruptly with limited experience (Opfer & Siegler, 2007;
Izard & Dehaene, 2008), and to closely track abilities to
deal with numbers in other contexts (Booth & Siegler, 2006;
Thompson & Siegler, 2010). Thus, just as an animal can

whereas the reverse was true of sixth graders and adults
(Siegler & Opfer, 2003). This developmental sequence has
been observed to occur at different ages with different
numerical ranges. It occurs between preschool and
kindergarten for the 0-10 range, between kindergarten and
second grade for the 0–100 range, between second and
fourth grade for the 0–1,000 range, and between third and
sixth grade for the 0–100,000 range (Berteletti, Lucangeli,
Piazza, Dehaene, & Zorzi, 2010; Opfer & Siegler, 2007;
