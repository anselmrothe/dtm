Figure 2: Outcome sequences used in one version of the experiment (version 3 only). Each sequence is shown as a random walk: every time
the machine turns on the blue light (whether observed by the participant or not), the walk takes a step up, and every time it turns red the walk
takes a step down. The sequences for the static condition are shown as the grey lines, and always have a consistent bias in one direction or
the other. The dynamic sequences are initially identical to the corresponding static sequences. After a change occurs (circles) the dynamic
sequences have the opposite outcomes to the corresponding static ones (black lines). Note that in game 5, the dynamic sequence did not have
a change point, so the two conditions used identical data in this case. This also happened in version 1 game 1 and version 2 game 3.
