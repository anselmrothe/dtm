   To quantify the similarity structure, or isomorphism, of
odor-color associations within a culture, we created one
representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM; Kriegeskorte et
al., 2008) for each population. The RDM has as many rows
and columns as there are odors, and each cell in the matrix
stands for the dissimilarity between the color-pattern of the
odors in the respective row and column. The diagonal of the
matrix therefore contains only the value of 0 for perfect
dissimilarity of an odor’s color-pattern with itself. The
dissimilarity was defined as 1 - correlation between the two
patterns (Pearson’s r).
   To quantify the difference between cultures, the second-
order isomorphism was calculated as the pair-wise
dissimilarity between the culture-specific RDMs, compiled
as one inter-culture RDM.
                 Results and Discussion
Figure 2 depicts the most frequently selected congruent
color matches for each odor within each culture. For
instance, the fruity odor tended to be associated with pink
and red colors, while the musty odor was more associated
with browns and oranges. Each of the 14 chi-square values
within each of our six groups was statistically significant.
Chi-square values ranged from 35.6-41.2, p all below
0.0002. (A Bonferroni corrected cutoff value for
significance for the 84 comparisons would result in a
threshold for significance of 0.0006.) This confirms that,
within each group, there were consistent patterns of color
choices for each odor. This result is consistent with those of
other studies that only had participants make congruent
matches (e.g., Gilbert, Martin, & Kemp, 1996; Demattè,
                                                                      Figure 2: Color congruency for each odor in each
