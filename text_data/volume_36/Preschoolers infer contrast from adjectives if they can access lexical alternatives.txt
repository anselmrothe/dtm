their performance depends on the familiarity of linguistic al-

portive context (contrasting with the younger children’s fail-
ures with color terms in our previous work). In Experi-
ment 2, adults’ performance was sustained when framing
cues supporting contrast were reduced (Experiment 2a), but
preschoolers were at chance without these framing cues (Ex-
periment 2b). In Experiment 3, before performing the same
task as in Experiment 2b, we read a book highlighting the            Figure 1: Example trial shape set. In the contrastive language
