Regarding our cognitive load manipulation, we find a mar-
ginal effect of load on word-length [F (1, 82) = 3.31, p
=.057, ηρ² = .04], indicating that speakers who performed
the task under high cognitive load articulated words faster
than speakers in the low load condition. This is not sur-
prising, given that we expect participants in the high
load condition to “hurry” in their descriptions, in order
to complete the task in time, which ultimately leads to
a faster articulation. With respect to the influence of cogni-
tive load on reduction, we find interactions between repeti-
tion and cognitive load with respect to the mean number of
words contained in a referential phrase [F (2, 78) = 4.1, p
<.05, ηρ² = .09], the duration of the referential phrases [F (2,
78) = 5.8, p <.005, ηρ² = .13], and the amount of common
ground information [F (1, 39) = 8.5, p <.01, ηρ² = .17]. Lack
