Relational Shift hypothesis (Gentner & Rattermann, 1991)
suggests that this difference is due to a lack of knowledge
about relational structures in younger children, and that as
they learn more, they gain the ability to make more
relational matches. Indeed, there is evidence that, under the
right conditions, preschool children can learn to carry out
relational matches.

symmetry and monotonic increase (Figure 1). In each triad,

merge process (Forbus et al., 1994). Each mapping consists
of three things: (1) A set of correspondences, which
describe what goes with what (i.e. what entities and
statements match) (2) A score that provides a numerical
estimate of similarity, and (3) a set of candidate inferences
which describe how connected but non-overlapping
structure can be projected from the base to the target (or in
reverse, from the target to the base), according to the
correspondences of that mapping.
   The similarity score can be normalized to be in the range
[0, 1]. There are two distinct normalization strategies, each
measuring something different. The first is to normalize by
