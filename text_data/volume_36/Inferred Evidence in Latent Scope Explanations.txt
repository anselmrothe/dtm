example, in the medical scenario, participants diagnosed
seven patients, each with a different name, set of
symptoms (fictitious names for E1 and E2), and diagnosis
options (fictitious names for C1 and C2). Five of the items
consisted of an “excerpt from a medical reference book,”
stating that one disease (C1) always caused one
biochemical to have abnormal levels (E1), while a second
disease (C2) always caused two biochemicals to have
abnormal levels (E1 and E2) but that nothing else was
known to lead to those abnormal biochemical levels.
Participants then read a “note from the lab,” confirming
result E1 but giving various reasons why the value of E2
was unknown. These reasons were (in order of
hypothesized epistemic distance): (1) the lab technician’s
handwriting was illegible; (2) the results were misplaced;

alternative causes (such as magical changes and
biochemical abnormalities). However, as P(E2) increases,
people would be increasingly likely to infer that E2
occurred and therefore to choose the broad latent scope
explanation; indeed, when P(E2) > 50%, they would have
a broad latent scope preference because they would infer
that E2 probably did occur. On the other hand,
manipulating P(E1) would have relatively little effect,
because E1 has already been observed, and therefore the
base rate is not needed to infer whether E1 occurred.
   In addition, we specified that P(C1) = P(C2), because
the posterior odds favoring C1 over C2 equal P(C1)/P(C2)
for deterministic causes. As explained in the introduction,
a dependence of explanatory preference on P(E1) or P(E2)
would be non-normative, and uniquely predicted by the
inferred evidence account.
