Abstract
Behavioral studies suggest that manipulable artifact concepts
are largely organized around action-based knowledge with
thematic and functional relations being privileged ways to
group objects together. Moreover, recent eye tracking studies
have shown that thematic and functional knowledge are
activated with different temporal dynamics during object
conceptual processing. In order to assess the
neurophysiological correlates of thematic and functional
knowledge activation, we used a priming paradigm in which
Event-Related Potentials were recorded during object
identification. The neural response was analyzed as a function
of the type of semantic relation shared by prime and target
objects: Thematic [saw-wood], Specific Function [saw-axe]
and General Function [saw-knife]. Results revealed graded
priming effects on the N400 component that could be related
to processing time course differences. Findings support the
hypothesis of distinct cognitive and neurophysiological
mechanisms underlying thematic and functional knowledge.
Keywords: EEG, Semantic priming, Thematic

Introduction
Increasing evidence indicates that action-related information
is a central part of our knowledge about manipulable
artifacts (i.e., manipulable manmade objects). For example,
damage to functional/motor feature information has been
associated with selective deficits in artifact knowledge
(Farah & McClelland, 1991). In property generation tasks,
functional/motor properties are produced relatively more
frequently in response to artifact than natural object
concepts (Cree & McRae, 2003; Garrard, Lambon Ralph,
Hodges, & Patterson, 2001; McRae, Cree, Seidenberg, &
McNorgan, 2005). Moreover, object recognition and
categorization can be facilitated by the prior presentation of
another object that shares action-related features (Helbig,
Graf, & Kiefer, 2006; Labeye, Oker, Badard, & Versace,
2008; Myung, Blumstein, & Sedivy, 2006). These
behavioral data, in addition to numerous neuroimaging
findings showing activation of the visuo-motor system

during processing of manipulable artifact concepts (Martin,
2007; Noppeney, 2008), are generally consistent with the
proposal that object conceptual knowledge is grounded in
sensory and motor systems (Barsalou, 1999, 2008; Borghi,
2005; Gallese & Lakoff, 2005).
The relevance of action-related information for
manipulable artifact concepts is also consistent with
previous work in the categorization domain. Categorization
studies have shown that thematic and functional relations
are particularly relevant for manipulable artifacts. In the
case of manipulable artifacts, thematic relations typically
correspond to tool-recipient relationships (e.g., screwdriverscrew), and are more quickly processed than categorical
relations (e.g., screwdriver-hammer; Kalénine & Bonthoux,
2008). Moreover, recent neuroimaging evidence (Kalénine
et al., 2009) indicates that identification of thematic
associations selectively activates brain regions associated
with the visuo-motor system (temporo-parietal areas),
further supporting the close link between thematic relation
processing and some aspect of object use experience. In
addition, contrary to natural object categories (e.g. animals),
manipulable artifacts are largely characterized by functional
attributes associated with object use (Cree & McRae, 2003;
Garrard et al., 2001; McRae et al., 2005), suggesting that
functional similarities play an important role in object
semantic structure. For example, hammer and screwdriver
are assumed to belong to the same category because they are
both used to repair things. Taken together, these findings
suggest that manipulable artifact concepts are largely
organized around action-based knowledge, with thematic
and functional relations being privileged ways to group
objects together. Yet little is known about how these two
types of information can be articulated in object semantic
structure.
Thematic and functional similarity relation processing has
been the focus of a few previous behavioral studies. One of
them used an explicit forced-choice task (Kalénine et al.,
2009) in order to compare identification speed of thematic
and categorical relations. Results showed faster explicit

1748

identification of thematic compared to categorical relations
in the case of artifact concepts. This result suggests different
time courses of activation for thematic and functional
knowledge, since categorical relations are largely based on
functional similarities for artifacts (i.e., tools, kitchen
utensils, etc.). In order to extend this finding to situations in
which explicit judgment of the semantic relations is not
required, a second line of work has used eye tracking in the
visual-world paradigm (VWP) (Kalénine, Mirman,
Middleton, & Buxbaum, 2012, Pluciennicka, Coello, &
Kalénine, 2013). In the basic version of the paradigm, four
pictures are presented to a participant, and eye movements
are recorded while the participant identifies a target object.
The principle of the VWP is that distractor objects that are
related to the target attract more looks relative to distractors
that are unrelated to the target. For example, when
participants hear the target word “saw” and have to identify
the object saw among 4 pictures including pictures of saw,
wood, feather and piano, they tend to look more to the wood
than to the semantically unrelated distractors before clicking
on the saw. This competition effect between target and
distractor objects is assumed to reflect incidental activation
of specific semantic information (e.g., “saw is used to cut
wood”) during object identification. In the two studies,
competition effects of similar amplitude were observed for 3
different types of semantic relation: thematic relations (e.g.,
saw–wood), specific function relations (saw-axe; cutting
wood) and general function relations (saw-knife; cutting).
However, the timing of the competition effect appeared to
be dependent on the type of semantic relation present in the
display. Competition effects with thematic distractors were
early and transient while competition effects with general
function distractors were late and long-lasting. Competition
effects with specific function competitors exhibited an
intermediate pattern. Thus, previous behavioral findings
have highlighted hierarchical activation time courses for
thematic, specific function and general function knowledge
during object conceptual processing.
The present study was designed in order to specify the
brain correlates of thematic and functional processing. In
particular, we aimed at examining whether differences
between thematic, specific functional and general functional
knowledge processing previously observed at the behavioral
level (Kalénine et al., 2012, Pluciennicka et al., 2013) could
be related to differences in neurophysiological correlates.
To this aim, a priming paradigm was used and EEG was
recorded while participants named object pictures that could
be preceded by related (thematic, specific function and
general function) or unrelated primes. A similar paradigm
had been used to assess priming effects driven by
manipulation similarity between objects (Kiefer, Sim,
Helbig & Graf, 2011). Following Kiefer et al. (2011), we
measured two ERP components (P100 and N400) evoked by
target object pictures in central and parietal regions. On
each component, priming effect amplitude was compared
between the different types of semantic relation between
object prime and target (thematic, specific function and

general function). Based on behavioral results (Kalénine et
al. 2012, Pluciennicka et al., 2013), we expected to find
graded priming effects in the Thematic, Specific Function,
and General Function conditions.

Methods
Eighteen adults (mean age 25.6; age range 19–37; 10
women) participated in the experiment. All participants
were right-handed (handedness quotients 50–100%; mean
90%; Oldfield 1971), had normal or corrected-to-normal
visual acuity and had French as a native or primary
language. None of the participants reported history of
dyslexia or any neurological diseases. The experimental
procedure was approved by the local ethical committee in
accordance with the Helsinki declaration. All participants
signed an informed consent form prior to their participation.

Stimuli
Stimuli were 105 color photographs of common objects
(200 x 200 pixels), including 15 target and 90 prime objects.
Among the prime objects, 45 were semantically related to
the target (15 Thematic, 15 Specific Function, 15 General
Function), and 45 were unrelated to the target (15 visually
similar and 30 visually dissimilar). The type of semantic
relation was manipulated in three conditions. In the
Thematic condition, the prime object could be used to act
upon/with the target (e.g., saw–wood). In the Specific
Function condition, the prime and the target were
functionally similar at a relatively specific level (saw-axe;
cutting wood). In the General Function condition, the prime
and the target were functionally similar at a relatively
general level (saw-knife; cutting). Unrelated pictures were
neither semantically nor phonologically related to the target,
but fifteen of them were visually similar, either in shape or
in color (saw-feather). A corpus-based similarity measure
(LSA) was used to assess overall semantic relatedness
between target and prime objects. As expected, related
object noun pairs were more semantically related than
unrelated noun pairs. Importantly, overall semantic
relatedness between target and prime object nouns was
equivalent between conditions.

Procedure
After a brief presentation of the EEG materials and general
goal of the study, participants were informed that they
would have to name a series of object pictures. During the
whole experiment, participants were seated in front of a
computer screen (1920 × 1080, 60 Hz) in a dimly
illuminated room.
Familiarization Session Prior to the EEG experiment, all
objects pictures were presented to the participant and named
by the experimenter. This was done to avoid possible
interference caused by hesitation between different object
nouns during the actual experiment and ensure that all
participants use basic-level names to identify objects.

Naming Task Participants were instructed to fix the
center of the screen where all events appeared in order to
minimize artifacts generated by gaze motion. The following
task specific instructions were delivered: “On each trial,
after a fixation cross presented in the center of the screen,
two successive object pictures will be briefly presented
(300 ms each) before a question mark. Your task will be to
name both objects in the presentation order after the
appearance of the question mark” (Figure 1). A delayed
naming task was used in order to prevent EEG signal
contamination by EMG signal of mouth muscles mobilized
during naming. After participant’s response, the question
mark was replaced by a hash mark until initiation of the next
trial. Instructions stressed the importance of accuracy but
did not set any constraint on response times. The same trial
procedure was used for the 360 trials: 4 sessions x 2 prime
categories (related, unrelated) x 3 types of semantic relation
(thematic, specific function, general function) x 15 targets.

Figure 1: Typical trial sequence used during naming task

Data Analysis
EEG was recorded continuously during the naming task
from 128 active electrodes mounted on an elastic cap (10-20
International system Electro-Cap Inc) with an Active Two
Biosemi system (Biosemi, Amsterdam, the Netherlands).
The impedance of all electrodes was kept below 20 kΩ.
Two additional electrodes were used to monitor eye
movements and blinks (one placed at lateral canthi and one
below the eyes). Continuous EEG was digitized at 512 Hz
and filtered offline (1-20 Hz) using EEGLAB software
(Delorme & Makeig, 2004) and recalculated to mastoid
reference. ICA-based artifact correction was used in order to
correct blink artifacts (Delorme, Sejnowski, & Makeig,
2007). Epochs consisting of 1000 ms pre-target and 800 ms
post-target were processed. Epochs contaminated by
muscular contractions or an excessive deflection (± 75 µV)
were detected by a visual inspection of the data, and
excluded from the averaged ERP waveforms. ERPs were

computed for each condition using a 200 ms time-window
before fixation cross as baseline.
Following Kiefer et al. (2011), we respectively collapsed
ERPs across 14 and 11 electrodes (A1, A2, B1, B2, B18,
B19, B20, B21, B22, D14, D15, D16, D17, D18 on the one
hand and A5, A8, A17, A18, A19, A20, A21, A30, A31,
A32, B5 on the other hand; see Figure 2). Activity recorded
in central and parietal regions is assumed to reflect the
activation of large temporo-parietal network involved in
manipuable object processing (Kiefer et al., 2011; Gerlach,
2007; Martin & Chao, 2001). Then, Mean Peak Amplitude
for P100 and N400 components was computed by averaging
the signal according to 85-115 and 370-510 ms time
windows, respectively.

Figure 2: Electrodes Position and Event-Related
Potentials measured in the central (top) and parietal
(bottom) Regions of Interest (ROIs). Periods represented in
grey on the ERP plots correspond to the time windows used
to compute Mean Peak Amplitude for our two components
of interest (85-115 ms for P100 and 370-510 ms for N400)
For each component, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
was conducted on the priming effect amplitude, namely the
difference between semantically related and unrelated (but
visually similar) object pairs, with Type of Semantic
Relation (Thematic, Specific Function, General Function),
and Region (Parietal, Central) as within-subject factors.
Semantically unrelated but visually related pairs were used
as baseline for computation of the priming effects for a
better control of the potential visual similarity between
semantically related object pairs.
At the neural level, facilitation for processing objects
preceded by related compared to unrelated primes should be
reflected by a diminution of the neural response for related
compared to unrelated pairs (Kiefer et al., 2011, Helbig et
al., 2006; Bentin, McCarthy, Wood, 1985). Thus, smaller

1750

priming effect amplitude corresponds to greater response of
the brain to semantically related objects. Overall, we
expected a main effect of Type of Semantic Relation on
priming effect amplitude. Following behavioral results
(Kalenine et al. 2012), we predicted that with limited object
prime processing (i.e with a Stimulus Onset Asynchrony of
366 ms, see Kiefer et al. 2011), priming effect amplitudes
should be ranked with thematic pairs < specific function
pairs < general function pairs. This hypothesis was further
tested with specific contrasts. Finally, significance of the
priming effect in each condition was verified by comparing
the amplitude of the related-unrelated pair difference with 0
in each condition using t-tests.

central region, the priming effect reached significance in the
Thematic condition only (t17 = 2.52; p < 0.05). Thus, N400
amplitude during object identification was influenced by
semantic priming beyond visual similarity and was sensitive
to the Type of Semantic Relation between prime and target.

Results
P100 component
The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of Region
on the P100 priming effect amplitude (F1,17 = 6.96; p <
0.05). There was also a significant interaction between
Region and Type of Semantic Relation (F2,34 = 5.09; p <
0.05). However, planned comparisons did not show any
significant difference between the 3 Types of Semantic
Relation in the two Regions considered. Besides,
comparison to 0 in each condition indicated that none of the
priming effects reached significance. Thus, P100 amplitude
during object identification did not differ as a function of
whether objects were preceded by semantically related
pictures (thematic, specific function and general function) or
visually similar pictures.

N400 component
The ANOVA showed significant main effects of Region and
Type of Semantic Relation on the N400 priming effect
amplitude (F1,17 = 8.42; p < 0.01 and F2,34 = 5.81; p < 0.01,
respectively). There was also a significant interaction
between Region and Type of Semantic Relation (F2,34 =
7.95; p < 0.01). As shown on Figure 3, planned comparisons
revealed that, in each region, Thematic and General
Function priming effects were significantly different (F1,17 =
4.60; p < 0.05 and F1,17 = 11.40; p < 0.01 for central and
parietal region, respectively) while Specific Function
priming effect did not differ from the average of the priming
effects in the two other conditions (for both regions, F1,17 <
1). This result demonstrates graded priming effects on the
N400 component in both central and parietal regions with
the Thematic condition showing maximal priming and the
General Function condition showing minimal priming1.
Besides, comparison to 0 in each condition indicated that
in the parietal region, priming effects reached significance
in the Thematic (t17 = 4.31; p < 0.001) and Specific
Function conditions (t17 = 3.19; p < 0.005), but not in the
General Function condition (t17 = 0.38; p = 0.71). In the

Since N400 is a negative component, greater reduction of the
neural response following related primes is reflected by greater
(i.e. less negative) priming effect amplitude.

Discussion
The present experiment highlights two main findings.
First, we found that the N400 component was sensitive to
the type of semantic relation between prime and target. Such
result is indicative of differences in activation of thematic
and functional knowledge during object conceptual
processing. Second, and contrary to what was suggested by
previous data (Kiefer et al., 2011), we did not observe any
difference between the different types of semantic relation
on object early visuomotor processing (P100).
In our paradigm, when we compared object processing
preceded by semantic primes with object processing
preceded by semantically unrelated but visually similar
primes, priming effects were observed on the N400
component only. It is not surprising to observe semantic
priming effects on the amplitude of the N400 component.
Indeed, N400 component is known to be involved in
semantic processing, since N400 is sensitive to semantic
deviation (Eddy et al., 2006; Deacon et al., 2000;
McPherson et al., 1999; Kutas et al., 1998). More
importantly, we found graded semantic priming effects on
the N400 component as a function of the type of semantic
relation. Compared to semantically unrelated but visually
similar primes, a reduction of the amplitude of the N400
component was observed when target objects were preceded
by thematically related primes (i.e. wood-saw < feathersaw). Conversely, no similar effect was observed when
prime and target shared a general function (i.e. knife-saw=
feather-saw). An intermediate pattern of results was visible
when prime and target shared a specific function (i.e. wood

1751

saw < axe-saw < knife-saw = feather-saw). Note that it is
very unlikely that the absence of semantic priming on the
N400 component in the general function condition is due to
poor overall semantic relatedness between primes and
targets in this particular condition. First, the LSA scores
collected in order to obtain a measure of overall semantic
relatedness between objects were equivalent between
conditions. Second, the amplitude of the competition effects
reported in previous eye-tracking studies (Kalénine et al.,
2012; Pluciennicka et al., 2013) did not differ as a function
of the type of semantic relation between target and distractor
objects (thematic, specific function, general function),
consistent with similar overall semantic relatedness for the 3
types of relation. Therefore, we suggest that the absence of
priming effect on the N400 component for general function
primes relates to differences in semantic activation timing
rather than differences in overall semantic relatedness
between conditions. The gradation of the N400 priming
effect amplitude may be related to differences in processing
time course, as reported in behavioral studies (Kalénine et
al., 2009; Kalénine et al., 2012; Pluciennicka et al., 2013).
Indeed, after limited processing of the prime object (366 ms
SOA), maximal priming was obtained for thematic relations
that are behaviorally processed within the shortest time. In
contrast, after only 366 ms of prime possible influence,
priming was absent for general function relations that
require most time to be processed. Consistent with
behavioral results, specific function relations exhibited
intermediate priming.
The present finding provides first arguments supporting
the hypothesis that thematic and functional knowledge are
processed with different temporal dynamics at the
neurophysiological level. It is consistent with the claim that
processing thematic and functional similarity relations rely,
at least partially, on distinct functional and neuroanatomical
mechanisms (Kalénine et al., 2012; Mirman & Graziano,
2012; Schwartz et al., 2011). Following behavioral results,
future work should increase the SOA between prime and
target in order to allocate more time to prime object
processing. With longer SOA, the pattern of priming effects
should reverse, and the emergence of priming effects for
general function relations should be observed.
Despite the poor spatial resolution of EEG data, the
electrode sites behind the reported N400 graded effects (in
central and parietal regions) are compatible with a
differential recruitment of temporo-parietal areas. Indeed,
previous studies using comparable paradigms indicated that
N400 source generators could be localized in inferior
temporal and somatosensory cortex (Kiefer et al., 2011).
Moreover, the idea that thematic priming activates temporoparietal areas more importantly than functional priming is
consistent with previous fMRI results (Kalenine et al.,
2009), and suggests a close connection between thematic
knowledge and object motor representation.
On early visuomotor processing represented by the P100
component, we did not observe any difference between the
three types of semantic relation. If we consider that

semantic priming can be visible as early as 100 ms after
target onset as Kiefer et al. (2011) suggested, we assume
that the effect would be general and would not depend on
the type of semantic relation between prime and target.
Surprisingly, we did not find any significant semantic
priming effect on P100 component when visual similarity
between prime and target was controlled, namely when the
baseline used for priming effect computation was
semantically unrelated but visually similar object pairs.
Best-case scenario, this result suggests that prior
presentation of a semantically related object has the same
amount of impact on object early visuomotor processing
(P100) as prior presentation of a visually similar object.
Worse case scenario, the semantic priming effect observed
on this component in previous studies (Kiefer et al. 2011) is
due to visual similarity. In Kiefer et al.’s study, priming
effects between objects sharing the same manipulation were
assessed at the neural level. In many cases, objects that
share the same manipulation tend to be also visually similar.
Since visual similarity was not systematically controlled in
their study, it is difficult to discriminate effects driven by
visual similarity from those driven by semantic relatedness.
Further work should evaluate early manipulation priming
effects on P100 component while strictly controlling for low
level visual differences between stimuli.

Conclusion
To sum up, semantic priming effects on the N400
component of the event-related brain potential response
were more important for thematically than functionally
related object pairs. Considering that the time allocated to
prime object processing was limited in our paradigm, the
pattern of priming effects observed could be consistent with
different activation time courses of thematic and functional
knowledge. In accordance with behavioral results (Kalénine
et al., 2009; Kalénine et al., 2012; Pluciennicka et al., 2013),
priming neurophysiological correlates suggest that object
conceptual processing recruits thematic knowledge first,
followed by specific and then general functional knowledge.
This pattern has been interpreted in relation to the closer
link between thematic knowledge and sensorimotor
experience (Kalénine et al. 2012). In contrast, semantic
priming was not visible on early P100 ERP component,
irrespective of the type of semantic relation, suggesting that
“semantic” priming effects on early (P100) and late (N400)
ERP components reported elsewhere (Kiefer et al., 2011)
actually rely on distinct processes. Future works should
further investigate the origin of the discrepancy between
priming effects on early and late components.
