Boolean MDL model. The independent influence model can
be viewed as a minimum description length (MDL) model be-
cause it infers the minimal instance of Equation 1 that accounts
for the available data. Our second model shares this emphasis
on minimal explanations, but works with a space of formulas
that includes all Boolean functions, not just the functions con-
sistent with Equation 1. For example, one explanation of the
pair [p, 1 − p] is the formula vh + v0 h0 , where hidden cause h
has a base rate of 1 − p. This formula is not permitted by the
independent influence model, which assumes that any cause
in the set {v, h1 , h2 , . . .} can only bind to a single variable in
Equation 1. The idea that arbitrary Boolean formulas may be
required to capture causal systems is consistent with some pre-
vious proposals (Yuille & Lu, 2008; Buchanan, Tenenbaum, &
Sobel, 2010), and is also closely related to Feldman’s work on
concept learning in a non-causal setting (Feldman, 2000). As
for the independent influence model, the Boolean MDL model
defines the complexity of a formula as the number of variable
tokens that it contains.                                                  Figure 2: The interface used by participants to design their
