make the defendant’s sufficiency more sensitive. Thus, the
defendant is regarded as less of a cause of the outcome, or                                                   *

they did not do that thing very relevant. If the sufficiency
condition is not met in those possibilities, the sufficiency of
the causal link between that actor and the outcome becomes
sensitive. Because the sufficiency of that causal link is
sensitive, the second actor is seen as less of a cause of the
outcome.
