Participants
Participants included 40 high-school students from pre-
calculus and calculus classes at two high-achieving public
suburban schools, one in New Jersey the other in
Pennsylvania. Their mean age was 16.6; 45% were male;
77% were White, 18% Asian, 3% Black, and 5% other
races. As a proxy for SES, median parental education was a
Bachelor’s degree.
Procedure
Parental consent and student assent were acquired, after
which students were tested individually in a session lasting
approximately 70 minutes. Participants completed a series
of paper and pencil measures. Participants then completed
the computer-presented CMR measure described in more
