                             Abstract
In the acquisition of skills requiring periodic body movements
such as in cascade juggling, the establishment of stable body
movements seems crucial. We investigated the processes of
developing stable body movements in each of the three learning
stages defined by the framework established by Beek and Van
Santvoord (1992). We focused on two types of stability: stability
of the body’s physical center, representing global structure of body
movements, and that of arm swing, representing local structure.
The experimental results revealed that the skills for establishing
local and global structures were acquired sequentially; in this case,
first local and then global. In addition, the analysis of verbal
reports suggested that stable body movements and conscious
attention are mutually related.                                             Figure 1: Schematic of the temporal sequence of events in

considerable differences in performance among the
participants. On the basis of their best performances on Day

impossible. Therefore, for this group, we analyzed body
movements from the initial toss to the final catch. Two of
the four participants in the Stage 1 group were excluded
from the analysis because the recording system failed to
capture their body movements.
  Basically, the trial that had the best performance recorded
was analyzed. However, when the recording system failed
to capture the positions of the three sites in the best
performance trial, we analyzed another trial in which the
second or third best performance was recorded.

positions of the three sites (the wrist, elbow, and chest, in              Figure 3: Standard deviation of the wrist positions
mm) at tossing timing. The error bars indicate the standard
errors. The participants in the Stage 1 group were excluded
from the statistical analysis because the criterion for
capturing data in that group was different, and the values of
each index were much larger than those in the other groups.
First, we evaluated the stability of arm swing for local body
movement. The ANOVA revealed a significant effect of the
Group factor on the SDs of the wrist positions (F (2, 7) =
6.97, p < .05). The post-hoc Ryan test showed that the SD in
the Stage 2 group was significantly larger than those in both
Stage 3 and Expert groups (MSe = 78.51, p < .05). The
ANOVA on the SDs of the elbow positions also revealed a
significant effect of the Group factor (F (2, 7) = 14.03, p
< .005). The post-hoc Ryan test also showed that the SD in
the Stage 2 group was significantly larger than those in
Stage 3 and Expert groups, respectively (MSe = 2.26, p
< .05).                                                                   Figure 4: Standard deviation of the elbow positions
  Meanwhile, for stability of the body’s physical center, an
ANOVA on the SDs of the chest positions revealed a
significant effect of the Group factor (F (2, 7) = 6.84, p
< .05). The post hoc-Ryan test also showed that the SD in
the Stage 3 group was significantly larger than that in the
Expert group (MSe = 2.66, p < .05).
  The overall results showed that the variability of body
movements in the Stage 1 group was much larger than that
in the other three groups. As for arm swing, representing
local structure of body movements, there was a significant
development from Stage 2 to Stage 3 in the stabilities of
both wrist and elbow movements; meanwhile, movements at
the chest’s physical center, representing global structure,
emerged between Stage 3 and the Expert stage. These
results imply that developmental stages in which local and
global structures are established are different. This also
suggests that the skills for establishing local and global                 Figure 5: Standard deviation of the chest positions

who reached each of the three stages. We categorized the
reported content into three categories.
     Physical: references to specific body movements. The
      following are representative examples:
       Catch a ball with the palm of the hand, not with
          fingertips.
       Continue three-ball cascade juggling while fixing
          the position of the elbows.
       Note the other hand, and try to throw a ball to the
          place of that hand.
     Temporal: references to temporal structures of body
      movements. The following are representative
      examples:
       Throw a ball at the time when another ball begins
          to fall from the zenith of its parabolic arc.
       Let the ball be in space, and lengthen that time as
          much as possible.
       Try to perform rhythmic throws and coordinate the
          rhythm to the movements of both hands.
     Spatial: references to spatial structures of manipulated
      objects (i.e., balls). The following are representative
      examples:
       Throw a ball to a consistent place.
       When throwing a ball, predict the place, where the
          ball will fall by watching the zenith of the parabolic
          arc continuously.
       Try to fix the pathway of the ball to attain a
          consistent parabolic arc shape.
