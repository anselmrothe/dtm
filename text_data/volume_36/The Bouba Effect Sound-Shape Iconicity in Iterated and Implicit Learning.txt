          Experiment 1: Iterated Learning
The iterated learning model (Scott-Phillips & Kirby, 2010)
approximates cultural evolution using diffusion chains, in
which a succession of separate participants (or generations)
each learn from the previous participant (rather like the
children’s game called ‘broken telephone’ or ‘Chinese
whispers’). An initial participant is taught a ‘language’ of
mappings between novel words and visual stimuli, and then
tested on names for stimuli they have seen and                       Figure 1: Stills from the stimuli for Experiment 1. Arrows

                       Experiment 2
Experiment 1 suggests that the mapping between bouba-
type labels and round shapes may be more iconic than the
mapping between kiki-type labels and spiky shapes.
Experiment 2 aims to further test any difference between the
two mappings, focusing on learning labels for visual stimuli
in a cross-situational learning paradigm (Yu & Smith,
2007), a methodology in which learning is implicit rather
than explicit, enhancing ecological validity as a model of
vocabulary acquisition. Previous work by Monaghan et al.
(2012) has used the methodology to demonstrate the
existence of an advantage for learning names showing kiki-        Figure 4 – A cross-situational learning trial (note that

opposite category. The same name was not permitted to
appear for two trials in a row. Within these constraints, trials
and trial order were randomised.
   One of the two conditions was the ‘round’ condition. In
this condition half of the shapes were round and half spiky
(eight of each), and, crucially, half of the names were round
and half neutral. The other condition was the ‘spiky’
condition – which again had eight round and eight spiky
shapes (different to the ones used in the round condition),
but by contrast had eight neutral names and eight spiky
names (again, neutral names were new). Shapes and neutral
names were counterbalanced across conditions between
participants. Condition order was also counterbalanced
between participants.
   At the outset of each participant’s experiment, each shape
was assigned a name from its condition (specific assignment
was counterbalanced between participants). Half of the
shapes in each category in each condition were assigned              Figure 6 – Results for the round condition in Experiment 2.
iconically congruent names. The other half of each category
were assigned iconically incongruent names.
   Here congruence is defined within whichever half of the
putative round-spiky spectrum of sounds the condition in
question covers. In the round condition, round name-round
shape pairings were considered congruent and round name-
spiky shape pairings were considered incongruent.
However, neutral name-spiky shape pairings were
considered congruent for the purposes of the following
analysis (as there are no spiky names in this condition, and
also in contrast to the incongruent round-name-spiky shape
pairings) and neutral name-round shape pairings were
considered incongruent (as they are less congruent than
round-round pairings). The converse applied for the spiky
