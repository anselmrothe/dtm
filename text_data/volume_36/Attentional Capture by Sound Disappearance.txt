Abstract
Three experiments are reported in which the attentional
capture effect of sound disappearance was assessed. In all
experiments participants were required to judge the pitch of
target sounds that were preceded by one or more context
sounds. In Experiments 1 and 2, targets presented in the same
location as a context sound that had abruptly terminated 100
ms before its presentation, were identified better than target
sounds presented in a different location. This result was
obtained both when targets followed a single context sound
(Experiment 1) and when targets followed pairs of
dichotically-presented context sounds that terminated at
different points (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 3
replicated those obtained in the previous experiments and
showed that under some conditions the facilitative effect
could persist at intervals longer than 100 ms. The results of
these experiments suggest that under some conditions, the
disappearance of a sound can capture attention.

Introduction
Given our dynamic, perceptually rich environment, it
seems intuitively reasonable that an abrupt change, such as
the sudden appearance or disappearance of an object, might
cause a reflexive allocation of attention towards that change.
Such a shift in attention would permit an appropriate and
timely response. Not surprisingly, current research suggests
that our perceptual and attentional processes responsible for
keeping track of the continuous flow of information about
objects and events have adapted in a way that allows a
constant updating of our perceptual representations to reflect
any relevant change in our environment (Samuel & Weiner,
2001).
There is a large body of literature suggesting that the
abrupt appearance of a visual or auditory stimulus can attain
attentional priority irrespective of our goals and beliefs
(Theeuwes, 1991; Yantis & Jonides, 1984). Such stimuli (or
cues), when placed near a target stimulus (Mondor &
Bryden, 1992; Posner, 1980) or which contain similar
properties to the target (Mondor & Lacey, 2001), have been
shown to produce facilitative effects in target discrimination
paradigms. Researchers generally agree that these cues
automatically draw attention to a particular location or
property even if they provide no predictive information
regarding the target and do not share any features with it.
This involuntary allocation of attention is commonly
referred to as attention capture (Mulckhuyse & Theeuwes,
2010).
Similar evidence has been reported in the visual literature
suggesting that the sudden disappearance of a stimulus can

also capture attention (Pratt & McAuliffe, 2001; Theeuwes,
1991; Yantis & Jonides, 1984). Pratt and McAuliffe (2001),
for example, used a location-cue paradigm, similar to that
developed by Posner and Cohen (1980), to investigate the
effects of object disappearance. Participants were presented
with two place-holder boxes to the left and right of a
fixation point. A dot could either appear in one of the boxes
(onset cue) or the display would begin with the cue and
disappear (offset cue) prior to target presentation. Similar to
previous results, early SOAs (100 ms) produced a
facilitative effect while later SOAs (900 ms) produced an
inhibitory effect.
Given the amount of empirical investigation into object
disappearance in visual attention, it is surprising that there
are no analogous studies in auditory attention using the
traditional cue paradigm. There are however, a few studies
that have examined the role of onset and offset cues with
respect to the “Simon effect”. Most recently, a study by
Nishimura and Yokosawa (2010) investigated the effects of
auditory accessory stimulus onsets and offsets on the Simon
effect. Participants in this study responded to a centrally
presented visual target with either a right or left key-press
and the accessory stimuli were presented binaurally through
headphones. The accessory stimuli consisted of a 300 Hz
pure tone and white noise. In the onset condition, a central
fixation point was presented for 2000 ms followed by the
target stimulus and one of the accessory stimuli (presented
monaurally to the left or right ear) presented simultaneously.
In the offset condition, the pure tone and white noise were
presented dichotically with the central fixation cross for
2000 ms, at which point one of the two sounds would offset
simultaneously with presentation of the target stimulus. The
results of this study showed response time facilitation when
the key-press corresponded with the location of the
accessory stimulus in the onset condition. In the offset
condition, responses were significantly quicker when the
key-press corresponded with the auditory channel that
persisted rather than the offsetting channel.
There are, however, some important differences between
these studies on the Simon effect and traditional cue
paradigms. First, Nishimura and Yokosawa’s (2010) study
utilized a crossmodal paradigm where the target was visual
and the cues were auditory. Considering the results in visual
offset studies vary greatly, and some differential effects are
found in cross-modal attention capture studies (Spence &
Driver, 1996), it is unclear how the cross-modal offset
results would correspond to a unimodal paradigm.
Secondly, in a typical Simon effect experiment the cue and
target are presented simultaneously, while in typical cue
paradigm facilitative effects are found when the cue

1946

precedes the target by 50 to 200 ms (Mondor & Lacey,
2001; Spence & Driver, 1994). Lastly, and perhaps most
importantly, the accessory Simon task does not involve
target localization. In the typical cue paradigm target
location is irrelevant to the discrimination or detection task
and the target can appear in multiple locations. In contrast,
the accessory Simon task consistently presents the target in
the center of the display. From these results, it is unclear
whether an auditory offset can cause a reflexive allocation
of attention to the corresponding location.
The present study has been designed to investigate
whether similar effects of object disappearance in visual
attention will be found in auditory attention. All three
experiments were designed in a similar fashion as the
location-cue paradigms used by Posner (1980), Pratt and
MacAuliffe (2001) and Mondor and colleagues (e.g.,
Mondor & Lacey, 2001). Given the inconsistent results in
the visual attention literature, it is unclear whether early or
late target presentation will produce facilitative, inhibitory
or null effects.

Experiment 1
In Experiment 1 participants were presented with a single
context sound followed by a target sound, each of which
could be presented from the right or left speakers.
The targets followed the context sound with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of either 100 or 200 ms. A target
discrimination task, judging the pitch of the target (high or
low), was performed for all trials. In order to learn how to
discriminate between the high and low tones participants
were required to complete a training session before
completing 96 experimental trials. While similar to a
traditional cuing paradigm, previous research studying
abrupt onsets used short cue durations (50 ms) with varied
stimulus-onset asynchronies (50 to 750 ms) between the cue
and target. To avoid possible onset effects, the context
sound in the current study was 1000 ms in duration with a
varied inter-stimulus interval (100 or 200 ms). Given that
this design employs a task independent of lateralization,
evidence of attention capture will be apparent if responses
on Valid trials (those trials where the cue offset and target
are located in the same channel) are executed more quickly
than Invalid trials (trials where the target and cue are
presented in different channels) as per other classic locationcue studies (Mondor & Bryden, 1991, 1992; Posner, 1980;
Pratt & McAuliffe, 2001; Spence & Driver, 1994).

Method
Participants. Twelve undergraduate students attending the
University of Manitoba participated in exchange for course
credit. None of the participants reported any corrected or
uncorrected hearing impairments.

Materials.
Computer and sound system. The experiments were
controlled by a Dell Pentium computer operating at 800
MHZ running the E-Prime programming software

(Psychology Software Tools, Inc., 2003). Sounds were
presented over Altec Lansing speakers (model #VS2620) at
a 45° angle from the listener and at an intensity of
approximately 70 dB.
Sounds. Sounds were synthesized using Adobe Audition
1.5 (Adobe, 2004) at a sampling rate of 44100 Hz. Two
target sounds were created. Both of these were pure tones,
one at 262 Hz and the other at 330 Hz, and both were 100
ms in duration including 5 ms onset and offset amplitude
ramps incorporated to eliminate clicks associated with
abrupt intensity changes. In addition, two context sounds, a
‘buzz’ and a ‘croak’, were also synthesized (these were
identical to sounds with the same names created and used by
Leboe & Mondor, 2007). The buzz context sound was
created using a square wave and included a fundamental
frequency of 200 Hz plus the first (400 Hz), second (600
Hz), third (800 Hz) and fourth (1000 Hz) harmonics. In
relation to the intensity of the fundamental frequency, the
harmonics were presented at 40%, 30%, 20% and 10%,
respectively. The croak context sound was created using a
sine wave with a fundamental frequency of 500 Hz that was
modulated randomly between 450 and 550 Hz at a rate of 40
times per second. The buzz and croak sounds were each
1000 ms in duration including 5 ms onset and offset
amplitude ramps.
Procedure. The experiment consisted of a training session,
two practice sessions and an experimental session. During
the training session participants were instructed to listen to
the target tones until the distinction between them was clear
(verbal confirmation). Following the training session, the
first practice session began. During each trial, one of the
target tones (100 ms in duration) was presented in isolation
following 500 ms of silence. The participants were
instructed to indicate whether the tone presented was the
high- or low-pitched tone using the keyboard (‘1’ for highpitched and ‘2’ for low-pitched). Participants received
accuracy feedback (presented on the computer screen:
correct or incorrect) following each response and were
instructed to initiate the next trial when they were ready by
pressing the space-bar on the keyboard. Each participant
was required to achieve 70% accuracy to move on to the
second practice session. If a participant did not meet this
criterion they were required to go through the training
session again and complete another block of practice trials.
The second practice session consisted of 16 trials and was
identical to the experimental trials, except that participants
received accuracy feedback following each response.
Participants were required to achieve 70% accuracy on the
second practice session before moving on to the
experimental trials. If a participant did not meet this
criterion after the first block they repeated one or more
blocks of 16 practice trials until they had done so.
For the experimental session, participants were presented
with either the buzz or croak context sound in either the left
or right channel followed by one of the two target tones

1947

presented in either the left or right channel. The time period
between the end of the context sound and the beginning of
the target sound (Inter-Stimulus Interval or ISI) could be
either 100 ms or 200 ms. On half of the 96 trials, the target
sound was presented in the same location as the preceding
context sound (these will be referred to as ‘Valid trials’),
and on the other half of the trials the target sound was
presented from the channel opposite the context sound
(these will be referred to as Invalid trials). Across trials, the
high- and low-pitched sounds were presented equally often
and each of these were preceded equally often by the buzz
and croak context sounds.

Results and Discussion.
Mean correct RT (outlying RTs, defined as those more or
less than 2.5 standard deviations from the initial mean, were
eliminated from the calculation of mean RT used in this and
all other experiments) and error rate as a function of Trial
Type and ISI are described in Table 1. Both RT and error
rates were submitted to a two-way within-subjects analysis
of variance (ANOVA; Trial Type [Valid, Invalid] X ISI
[100, 200]). The RT analysis revealed significant main
effects of Trial Type, F(1,11) = 6.55, p = .027, and ISI,
F(1,11) = 25.10, p < .001, and a significant interaction
between ISI and Trial Type, F(1,11) = 8.78, p = .013. The
analysis of error rates produced no significant results in all
cases (p > .05).
To explore the significant effects on RT, performance was
examined separately for the 100 ms and 200 ms ISI
conditions. At 100 ms ISI, RT varied significantly as a
function of trial type, F(1,11) = 10.19, p < .01, as
participants responded significantly more quickly on Valid
trials (M = 577 ms) than on Invalid trials (M = 607 ms). At
200 ms ISI, however, performance on the two trials types
did not differ significantly (p > .05).

should be replicated Experiment 2 despite the added context
sound.

Experiment 2
The results of Experiment 1 are consistent with the
possibility that the disappearance of an auditory object can
capture attention at short ISIs (100 ms). In Experiment 2, we
sought to determine whether this result would be replicated
when two context sounds are presented simultaneously, one
ending before the other. Similar to Experiment 1, one
context sound offset either 100 or 200 ms prior to the
presentation of the target while the second context sound
ended 25 ms prior to the target (see Figure 1). There is a
large body of evidence that suggests that at least 50 ms is
required to disengage attention and shift to a new object
(Logan, 2005; Theeuwes, Godijn, & Pratt, 2004). We
reasoned that 25 ms was likely an insufficient amount of
time to redeploy attention to the other channel prior to the
target onset. Therefore, in this paradigm, evidence of
attention capture will be apparent if responses are executed
more quickly when the target is presented in the same
channel as the earlier offsetting context sound. This also
eliminates a possible confound in Experiment 1, that the
valid trials were facilitated by the presentation of a single
context sound in only one channel.

Method
Participants. Thirty undergraduate students attending the
University of Manitoba participated in exchange for course
credit. None of the participants reported any corrected or
uncorrected hearing impairments.

Given that the response times were faster when the target
followed the disappearance of the context sound at the early
ISI of 100 ms these results can be taken as preliminary
evidence that object disappearance can direct attention.
However, it is possible that the absence of any sound in the
opposite channel was in fact directing attention as opposed
to the sound offset. Another possibility is that the onset of
the cue produced a facilitative effect. Experiment 2 was
designed to address these issues by adding a second,
competing context sound, while maintaining the paradigm
of Experiment 1. If it was in fact the offset of the context
sound directing attention in Experiment 1, then the results

Materials. The computer, sound system and sounds used in
Experiment 2 were identical to those used in Experiment 1.
The experimental paradigm was similar to the first
experiment except that different context sounds were
presented concurrently from different locations (one from
the left channel and one from the right channel). In addition,
whereas one of the context sounds terminated either 100 or
200 ms prior to the onset of a target, the other terminated 25
ms prior to the target. The target sound was presented either
in the same location as the longer context sound (25 ms ISI)
or in the location of the shorter context sound (100 or 200
ms ISI). Therefore, the two context sounds began at the
same time but one ended 75 ms or 175 ms before the other.
Several different durations of the context sounds were used
so that listeners were unable to anticipate precisely when

they might end. Specifically, the shorter / longer durations
(in ms) of the pair of context sounds used on a particular
trial could be 1000 / 1075, 1450 / 1525, 1950 / 2025, 900 /
1075, 1350 / 1525, and 1850 / 2025. Target sounds were
randomly presented to either the left or right channel and
could occur either 25 ms after the context sound that ended
last or 100 ms or 200 ms after the context sound that ended
first.
Procedure. The procedure for Experiment 2 was similar to
that used in Experiment 1. However, as noted above, two
context sounds were presented dichotically on each trial .
One of these ended 75 ms or 175 ms before the other and
the single target sound presented on each trial could occur
either in the same channel as the context sound that ended
first (ISI in this case was either 100 ms or 200 ms) or in the
same channel as the context sound that ended last (ISI in
this case was 25 ms). The target sound was always
presented after both context sounds had ended.
We thought it possible that the overall context in which
targets were presented may have an impact on performance.
For this reason we designed the experiment so that
participants completed an equal number of trials when the
context sounds differed in duration by 75 ms (referred to as
the ‘small-context-difference’ condition) and when they
differed by 175 ms (referred to as the ‘large-contextdifference’ condition). Within each of these conditions,
participants completed an equal number of trials when the
target was presented in the same channel as the context
sound ending first (referred to as ‘target following shorter
context sound’) and when the target was presented in the
same channel as the context sound ending second (referred
to as ‘target following longer context sound’). We preserved
this distinction in our analysis and evaluated performance
for the small-context-difference and large-contextdifference conditions separately.
Participants completed a total 196 experimental trials. All
other methodological details were the same as for
Experiment 1.

Results and Discussion
Mean correct RT and error rates as a function of Channel
and Context are displayed in Table 2. As in Experiment 1, a
two-way within-subjects ANOVA (Channel [Target
following longer context sound, Target following shorter
context sound] x Context [Small-Context-Difference, LongContext Difference]) was conducted using RT and error
rates as the dependent measures. The RT analysis showed a

significant main effect of Context, F(1,29) = 9.97, p = .004,
and a significant interaction between Context and Channel,
F(1,29) = 5.33, p < .028. The main effect of Channel was
not significant, F (1, 29) = 1.03, p = .32.
A separate analysis of the Small-Context-Difference
condition revealed that RT varied significantly as a function
of Channel, F(1,29) = 5.05, p = .032; participants responded
significantly more quickly when the target followed the
shorter context sound (M = 674 ms) than the longer context
sound (M = 697 ms). However, in the Large-ContextDifference condition there was no significant difference in
response times. F(1,29) = 1.93, p = .176.
The analysis of error rates produced no significant main
effects of Context or Channel (p > .05). There was a
significant interaction effect between Context and Channel
[F (1, 29) = 6.07, p = .02], though further analysis of the
Small- and Large-Context-Difference conditions revealed
no significant differences between error rates (p > .05).
Participants responded more quickly to the target when it
followed the shorter context sound but, as with Experiment
1, this effect occurred only when the target followed at 100
ms ISI and not when it followed at 200 ms ISI. These
results, again, suggest that the sudden disappearance of
sound can direct attention.

Experiment 3
Experiment 3 was designed to replicate the findings in
Experiment 2 while extending the paradigm to examine the
effects of later target presentation. As noted above, the
visual attention literature is inconsistent about how long the
attentional capture effect will persist following object
disappearance; therefore it is unclear what the effects of the
longer ISI will be. Furthermore, the results of Experiment 1
would suggest that later target presentation will lead to null
effects, but it is unclear whether the presentation of two
competing context sounds will cause differential effects. In
Experiment 3, the conditions used in Experiment 2 are
included again along with conditions in which the target is
presented at longer ISIs.
Method
Participants. Sixteen undergraduate students attending the
University of Manitoba participated in exchange for course
credit. None of the participants reported any corrected or
uncorrected hearing impairments.
Materials. The computer, sound system and sounds used in
Experiment 3 were identical to those used in Experiment 2.

1949

Procedure. The procedure for Experiment 3 was identical
to Experiment 2 except that target sounds could be
presented either 25 ms following the last-ending context
sound and 100 or 200 ms following the first-ending context
sound (Brief ISI condition; see Figure 1) or either 425 ms
following the last-ending context sound and 500 or 600 ms
following the first-ending context sound (Long ISI
condition; see Figure 2). These additional ISIs were
incorporated to assess the time-course of orienting in
response to abrupt offsets.

Figure 2. Schematic illustration of the Long ISI trials in
Experiment 3.
In keeping with the reasoning we elaborated in
Experiment 2, we designed the experiment so that
performance could be evaluated separately for each
combination of the relative durations of the context sounds.
Thus, the data was analyzed as a three-way factorial design
(ISI Category [Brief, Long] X Channel [Target following
longer context sound, Target following shorter context
sound] X Context (Small-Context-Difference, LargeContext-Difference).
Experiment 3 was the same as Experiment 2 in all other
respects.

Results and Discussion
Mean correct RT and error rate as a function of Context,
Channel and ISI are described in Table 3. A three-way
within-subjects ANOVA (ISI Category [Brief, Long] X
Channel [Target following longer context sound, Target
following shorter context sound] X Context (Small-ContextDifference, Large-Context-Difference) was conducted for
the RT and error rates. The analysis of error rates yielded no

significant effects in all cases (p > .05). The RT analysis
revealed a significant main effect of ISI Category, F(1,15) =
60.95, p < .001, and a significant interaction effect between
Context and Channel, F(1,15) = 8.77, p = .01.
To remain consistent with earlier RT analyses, each of the
Context conditions was analyzed separately. The RT
analysis of the Small-Context-Difference condition revealed
a main effect of ISI Category, F(1,15) = 51.99, p < .001, and
Channel, F(1,15) = 11.35, p = .004. Overall, participants
responded more quickly when the target followed the
shorter context sound (M = 568 ms) than when it followed
the longer context sound (M = 589 ms) and response times
in the Long ISI condition (M = 554 ms), were significantly
faster than the Brief ISI condition (M = 612 ms).
Further analysis of the Brief ISI condition revealed that
participants responded significantly more quickly when the
target followed the shorter context sound (M = 601 ms) than
when it followed the longer context sound (M = 624 ms),
F(1, 15) = 6.35, p = .024. Likewise, in the Long ISI
condition participants also responded significantly more
quickly when the when the target followed the shorter
context sound (M = 536 ms) rather than the longer context
sound (M = 553 ms), F(1,15) = 5.28, p = .036.
The analysis of the Large-Context-Difference condition
revealed a significant effect of ISI Category, F(1,15) =
31.39, p < .001, though no significant effect of Channel,
F(1,15) = .199, p = .662, and no interaction effect, F(1, 15)
= 1.12, p = .307. Further analyses of the Brief and Long ISI
categories produced non-significant results; RT did not
significantly vary as function of Channel placement in either
the Brief, F(1,15) = .227, p = .606 or Long ISI conditions,
F(1,15) = 1.5, p = .240.
The results of the Brief ISI condition replicated the
findings of Experiment 2, where participants responded
more quickly when the target followed the shorter context
sound on the Small-Context-Difference trials (100 ms ISI),
but not on the Large-Context-Difference trials (200 ms ISI).
Likewise, in the Long ISI condition, participants responded
more quickly when the target followed the shorter context
sound on the Small-Context-Difference trials (500 ms ISI),
but not on the Large-Context-Difference trials (600 ms ISI).
Therefore, there was a significant attentional capture effect
when there was a small difference between the offsets (75
ms), but not when there is a large difference (175 ms).

Concluding Comments
In three experiments we explored whether the sudden
disappearance of a sound can capture attention in a similar
fashion to the sudden occurrence of a sound. All three
experiments utilized a cue paradigm similar to that
developed by Posner and colleagues (1980) and used in
other similar auditory and visual attentional capture
experiments (e.g., Mondor & Lacey, 2001; Pratt &
McAuliffe, 2001; Spence & Driver, 1994). In Experiment 1,
we found that participants responded significantly more
quickly when the target followed the offset cue, but only
when the inter-stimulus interval was 100 ms. This suggests
that the sudden disappearance of a sound can capture
attention and it takes about 100 ms to orient to the offset.
In Experiment 3, the extent to which attention might be
captured at longer intervals was examined.. The results
showed that despite the late target presentation, participants
still responded more quickly when the target followed the
shorter context cue, but again only when the difference
between the cues was small (75 ms). Similar to the findings
of Experiment 2, there were null effects when the difference
between the cues was large (175 ms). It seems likely, given
the literature, that the 75 ms difference is not enough time to
reorient to the second offset maintaining the attentional
capture effects of the first offset.
Interestingly, the results of Experiments 1 and 2 suggested
that the attentional capture effects would not persist when
the ISI between the cue and target was longer than 100 ms.
However, in Experiment 3 when the second context cue
disappears shortly after the first, the effect persisted with an
ISI of 500 ms. This suggests that the overall context (two
competing cues versus a single cue) had an impact on the
attentional capture effect of the offset.
Taken together, the results of the three experiments
reported above provide evidence that auditory attention may
be oriented reflexively to the spatial position in which a
sound abruptly disappears.
