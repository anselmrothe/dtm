Abstract
Recent work on causal learning has investigated the possible
role of generic priors in guiding human judgments of causal
strength. One proposal has been that people have a preference
for causes that are sparse and strong—i.e., few in number and
individually strong (Lu et al., 2008). Sparse-and-strong priors
predict that competition can be observed between candidate
causes of the same polarity (i.e., generative or else
preventive) even if they occur independently. For instance,
the strength of a moderately strong cause should be
underestimated when a strong cause is also present, relative to
when a weaker cause is present. In previous work (Powell et
al., 2013) we found such competition effects for causal setups involving multiple generative causes. Here we investigate
whether analogous competition is found for strength
judgments about multiple preventive causes. An experiment
revealed that a cue competition effect is indeed observed for
preventive causes; moreover, the effect appears to be more
persistent (as the number of observations increases) than the
corresponding effect observed for generative causes. These
findings, which are consistent with predictions of a Bayesian
learning model with sparse-and-strong priors, provide further
evidence that a preference for parsimony guides inferences
about causal strength.

Introduction
Prior Beliefs in Causal Learning
Humans (and other intelligent organisms) are able to extract
causal knowledge from patterns of covariation among cues
and outcomes (for a review see Holyoak & Cheng, 2011).
This knowledge enables us to predict the likely effects of
interventions, and to better anticipate the outcomes of
actions and events in the world. Causal knowledge goes
beyond mere strength of association, instead depending on
inferences about underlying causal links. Because causal
relationships are not themselves observable, their existence
must be posited a priori. Thus a certain degree of prior
knowledge about causal relationships is required before
causal learning can occur.
Viewed from a Bayesian perspective, causal inferences
are expected to be a joint function of likelihoods (the

probability of observing the data given potential causal links
of various possible strengths) and priors (expectations about
causal links that the learner brings to the task). An
understanding of how causal links operate and act together
is encoded in the likelihood term, whereas prior knowledge
about what sorts of causal relationships are most likely is
encoded in the prior term. Generic causal priors constitute
preferences for certain types of causal explanations, based
on abstract properties rather than domain-specific
knowledge.
Although some Bayesian models have assumed
uninformative priors (e.g., Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2005),
other models have incorporated substantive generic priors
about the nature of causes. Lu et al. (2008) proposed that
people have a preference for causes that are sparse and
strong: i.e., a preference for causal models that include a
relatively small number of strong causes (rather than a
larger number of weak causes). Using an iterative-learning
method, Yeung and Griffiths (2011) empirically derived a
different (though non-uniform) prior that was suggestive of
a preference for strong causes, but that lacked the
competitive pattern associated with the sparse prior.
However, in their study the iterative method did not fully
converge for the background cause; hence their results are
open to multiple interpretations. Sparse-and-strong priors
can be viewed as a special case of a more general pressure
to encourage parsimony (Chater & Vitanyi, 2003), which
implies a combination of simplicity and explanatory power
(see also Novick & Cheng, 2004; Lombrozo, 2007).

Generic Prior: Sparse-and-Strong (SS) Causes
Lu et al. (2008) formalized the “SS power” model with
sparse-and-strong (SS) priors for simple causal models with
a single candidate cue and a constantly-present background
cause. By default (in accord with the power PC theory of
causal learning; see Cheng, 1997), the background cause is
assumed to be generative (making the effect happen). When
the candidate cause also generates (rather than prevents) the
effect, SS priors create an expectation that the candidate
cause will be strong (strength close to 1) and the

2793

background weak (strength close to 0), or vice versa. A
single free parameter, α, controls the impact of the prior
(when α = 0, the prior distribution of strength is uniform).
Lu et al. (2008) fit several causal learning models to
parametric data for human strength judgments. They found
the best fit was provided by a Bayesian implementation of
the power PC theory that incorporated SS priors with an α
value of 5 (not 0), implying a human preference for sparseand-strong causes.
The original formulation only considered the simple case
of competition between one generative candidate cause and
the (generative) background cause. More recently, Powell et
al. (2013) generalized the model to situations involving
multiple generative candidate causes. The qualitative
signature of SS priors is the preference for one strong cause
of a given polarity (generative or else preventive) coupled
with other weak causes; for example, a set of “ideal” causal
strengths for three generative causes might be wA=1, wB=0
and wC=0 (where each w indicates a value of causal
strength, ranging from 0 to 1, for a particular candidate
cause). Note that the SS prior does not express any
preference about precisely which cause(s) are strong and
which are weak.
This preference instantiated in SS priors implies a key
empirical prediction: in judgments of causal strength,
competition will be observed when multiple causes of the
same polarity co-occur. That is, if a candidate cause appears
along with one or more other causes of greater strength (as
defined by likelihoods), then the strength of the weaker
candidate cause will be underestimated.
Powell et al. (2013) tested the prediction of SS priors
using a causal setup with three generative candidate causes.
The objective power of one cause (A) was fixed at a
moderate value of .50. The power of a second generative
cause (B) was varied across conditions to be either low (.20)
or high (.80). A third cause (C) served as a “visible”
background cause, with power always set to a low value
(.10). The contingencies were arranged so that the
occurrences of cues A and B were uncorrelated with each
other. Neither A nor B ever appeared alone (whereas C
sometimes did), creating uncertainty in estimating the
strengths of A and B. After participants had made a
relatively small number of observations, cue A was judged
to be weaker when the alternative (but uncorrelated) cause B
was strong than when it was weak. After additional cases
were presented, the two conditions converged. Powell et al.
showed that a sparse-and-strong prior accurately
characterized the expectations that would create the
observed competition effect. This competition dynamic
cannot be explained by naïve Bayesian models that assume
uninformative priors (Busemeyer et al., 1993).

multiple preventive causes. To the best of our knowledge,
no previous study has investigated this possibility. The
original formulation of SS priors (Lu et al., 2008) only
considered the case of a single candidate cause coupled with
the background cause. By default the background cause is
assumed to be generative (since unless something generates
the effect, it is impossible to assess whether other cues
prevent it). Hence, in the case of a single candidate cause,
SS priors predict competition effects for a generative
candidate (which will compete with the generative
background cause), but not for a preventive candidate
(which will not compete with the generative background,
given the basic assumption that only causes of the same
polarity compete). In accord with these predictions, Lu et al.
reported experiments showing competition effects for
strength judgments about a generative candidate cause, but
not a preventive cause.
Preventive causes are known to exhibit several
asymmetries relative to generative causes (Carroll, Cheng &
Lu, 2013; Cheng et al., 2007), so it is not obvious whether
or not competition effects would be observed for preventive
causes in more complex setups. However, the general
principle of SS priors implies that multiple preventive
causes will also compete. Testing this hypothesis requires
creating a more complex, multi-cue causal setup, similar to
the three-cause setup Powell et al. (2013) used to show
competition among multiple generative causes. In the
present paper we extend the Bayesian formulation of SS
priors to the case of multiple preventive causes, and report
an experiment that tests whether or not multiple preventive
causes compete in causal strength judgments.

Generating Contingency Data
As reviewed above, the sparse-and-strong prior predicts
competition between co-occurring causes of the same
polarity. We constructed a set of contingency data D
(summarized in Table 1) based on the presence of one
generative cause (C) and the occurrence or non-occurrence
of two preventive causes (A and B). Two conditions were
created. The causal powers of A and C were held constant
across the two conditions (preventive at −.50 and generative
at .80, respectively, coding preventive causes as negative
strength values). The causal power of B varied from one
condition (−.25, weak-B condition) to the other (−.75,

were independent in both conditions.
In constructing these contingency data, we employed the
noisy-OR likelihood function for generative causes, and the
noisy-AND-NOT function for preventive causes (in accord
with the power PC theory; Cheng, 1997), since binary
causes and effects were used in the experiments. For
example, if cues A and B are preventive causes, and cue C
is a generative cause, the probability of the effect can be
calculated as:

𝑃(𝑤! , 𝑤! , 𝑤! ) ∝
𝑒 !! !!!! 𝑒 !!!! !!(!!!! ) + 𝑒 !! !!!! !!!! ,                                                                                    𝑃𝑃𝐺

  𝑒 !! !!!! !!!! !!!! + 𝑒 !!!! !!(!!!! )!!!! + 𝑒 !!!! !!!! !!(!!!! ) ,      𝐺𝐺𝐺

(3)

Similarly, the likelihood function was specified over each of
the four regions:
𝑃 𝐷 𝑤! , 𝑤! , 𝑤!

𝑃 𝐸 = 1 𝑤! , 𝑤! , 𝑤! = 𝑤! (1 − 𝑤! )(1 − 𝑤! ) (1)

(4)
Finally, the posterior was calculated based on Bayes rule as

where E = 1 indicates the presence of the effect.

Causes

𝑃 𝑤! , 𝑤! , 𝑤! 𝐷 =

The sparse-and-strong prior for multiple generative and
preventive causes can be extended using mixture
distributions as proposed in Lu et al. (2008). The key idea is
that causes with the same polarity compete. For example, in
the situation involving cue C as a generative cause and two
other cues, A and B, as preventive causes, the sparse-andstrong prior can be defined as:

𝑃 𝑤! , 𝑤! , 𝑤!
∝ 𝑒 !!

(𝑒 !!!! !!(!!!! ) + 𝑒 !!

(1 − 1 − 𝑤! 1 − 𝑤! )(1 − 𝑤! ),        𝑃𝐺𝐺

(1 − 1 − 𝑤! 1 − 𝑤! )(1 − 𝑤! ),        𝐺𝑃𝐺  
1 − 1 − 𝑤! 1 − 𝑤𝑩 1 − 𝑤! ,            𝐺𝐺𝐺

(2)

Importantly, participants in our experiment were not
informed of the polarity of the individual causes they
observed. That is, prior to observing the contingency data,
they did not know which cause(s) generated the effect and
which prevented it. As discussed by Lu et al. (2008), the SS
power model can be extended to cover situations in which
the causal polarity of cues is not known in advance. Since
human participants observed a C-only condition, we assume
for simplicity that the polarity of cause C (generative) is
known (as the likelihood that C is a preventer rapidly falls
to zero in light of the contingency data). To predict
participants’ responses in this experimental context, we
therefore derived sparse-and-strong prior distributions for
four combinations of generative and preventive A and B
cues. The prior probability was computed over a domain of
strengths for both A and B in the range [-1,1]. Density in
positive regions represents probability density for generative
strengths, whereas density in negative regions represents
probability density for preventive strengths. Equation 3
gives the sparse-and-strong prior functions for each
quadrant of the domain. Quadrants are labeled with a threeletter code specifying the polarity of each cause (“P” for
preventive and “G” for generative) in the order A, B, C. For
instance, the region representing A and B as preventers and
C as a generator is labeled “PPG”.
Thus, we derived the following sparse-and-strong prior
distribution over the four quadrants of the space depending
on causal polarities for cues A and B:

! ! !! ,!! ,!! ! !! ,!! ,!!
! !

  .

(5)

To compare with human ratings, the SS power model
computes the mean of estimated causal strength derived
from the posterior distribution:
𝑤! =

!
𝑤 𝑃(𝑤! |𝐷).
! !

(6)

The posterior distribution P(wA | D) is obtained by
marginalizing the posterior probability distribution
calculated in Equation 5. The means of causal strengths
estimated from the posterior distributions were used to
compare with ratings from human participants, as shown in
Figure 2 and Table 2.
The model makes two key predictions. First, the
preventive cause A should be underestimated when in the
presence of a stronger preventer, relative to when it is
accompanied by a weaker preventer. Notably, this
competition effect is predicted despite the fact that A and B
occur independently. In contrast, a model assuming uniform
priors predicts no such competition (see Figure 2). Second,
this competition effect should diminish across learning
trials. Priors tend to be most informative when data is
scarce. As the model is exposed to more data, the likelihood
term should eventually swamp out the competition driven
by the prior term. However, as shown in Figure 2, the
predicted impact of the priors persists even after three
blocks of contingency data (the maximum data that
participants received in our experiment). When compared to
the corresponding predictions for three generative causes
(Powell et al., 2013), the competition effect is predicted to
be more persistent for the preventive case (potentially due to
the greater uncertainty for causes of unknown polarities).

Experiment
Method
Participants Participants were 107 undergraduate students
at the University of California, Los Angeles, who
participated for class credit (29 male, mean age = 21 years).
Of these, 49 were assigned to the strong-B condition and 58
to the weak-B condition.

Procedure Participants read the following cover story:
“Imagine that you are assisting a doctor at a new island
resort. Many of the guests at this new resort have become
ill, and your job is to determine the cause of the illnesses.
The resort's doctor suspects that the illnesses may be caused
by the food the guests are eating. The resort provides a
complimentary salad bar that offers a selection of exotic
vegetables. The guests’ salads can be different mixes of
these vegetables. One or more of the vegetables could be
making the guests sick. However, not all of the guests who
ate salad are getting sick. One or more of the vegetables
may have medicinal properties that prevent the illness. Your
job is to independently examine the doctor’s theory and
determine what effects these different vegetables have on
the guests. These are the three vegetables [pictures of
vegetables are shown]. You will be reviewing a number of
case files that describe what a guest ate and whether they
became sick. Please pay attention to each case…. At several
points throughout the study, you will be asked to give your
assessment of the vegetables. You will be asked to assess
whether each vegetable causes or prevents the illness. You
will also be asked to estimate how likely each vegetable is
to make someone sick or prevent the illness.”
These vegetables were labeled A, B, and C, and were
represented by photographs of actual exotic vegetables:
radicchio, bitter melon, and black garlic. The assignment of
vegetables to the labels A, B and C was randomized across
participants. During the learning phase, participants viewed

Figure 1: Example trial showing sick guest who ate A,
B, and C vegetables (top). Example response trial for
preventive cause (bottom).

“case files” for individual guests, showing which
combination of vegetables they had eaten, and whether or
not they had fallen ill (see Figure 1, top, for an example):
There were four possible combinations of vegetables:
each guest had either eaten vegetable C alone, vegetables A
and C, vegetables B and C, or all three vegetables A, B, and
C. These four combinations were presented in equal
number, such that A and B both occurred 50 percent of the
time, and the correlation between the occurrence of A and B
was 0 (see Table 1). Forty cases (10 of each type) were used
per block, as this was the minimum number required to
reflect the underlying causal powers in the presented
distribution of cause combinations and their associated
outcomes.
The numbers of guests who became sick after eating each
combination were determined by the causal powers assigned
to each vegetable. This number was calculated according to
the noisy-OR and noisy-AND-NOT likelihood functions,
under the default assumption that all causes act
independently of one another (Cheng, 1997). In both
conditions, vegetable C was the generative cause of the
illness present on every trial, acting with a causal strength of
.80. Vegetables A and B were always preventive causes, but
the strength of vegetable B varied depending on the
condition participants were assigned to. Participants were
randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions
(weak-B or strong-B). In the strong-B condition, vegetable
B was assigned a preventive causal strength of −.75,
whereas in the weak-B condition, vegetable B was assigned
a causal strength of −.25. In each case, vegetable A
prevented the illness with strength −.50. Cause A was the
focus of the study, as we were interested in whether its
judged strength would be influenced by the variation in the
strength of cause B. Participants were not told ahead of time
which vegetables were generative causes and which were
preventive causes.
Participants viewed three blocks of 40 trials each. In each
block, the 40 cases were presented sequentially in a
different random order for each participant. After
completing a learning block, participants were asked
questions about each vegetable. For each vegetable,
participants were first asked a causal polarity question.
Participants were shown a picture of each vegetable along
with a question asking whether it caused or prevented the
illness. Participants pressed “C” to indicate that they
thought the vegetable caused the illness, and “P” to indicate
that they thought it prevented the illness.
After they indicated which type of cause they believed a
vegetable was, they advanced to the causal strength
question. If they believed the vegetable was a generative
cause, they were asked, “Suppose 100 people ate this
vegetable, how many will get sick?” If they believed the
vegetable was a preventer they were asked, “Suppose 100
people are about to get sick. If they all eat this vegetable,
how many of the 100 will not get sick?” Participants then

2796

made their rating using a slider, inputting a value between 0
and 100 (see Figure 1, bottom). The polarity question
always preceded the strength question, but the order of the
three vegetables was randomized for each participant and
block. After responding to all questions in a block,
participants were shown a summary of their responses and
were asked to confirm that they had correctly entered their
ratings.

Results
Six participants mistakenly indicated that cause C was a
preventer during at least one of the three blocks. As it is
unclear how their other responses are to be interpreted in
light of this error, data from these participants were
excluded from analyses. Participants’ polarity judgments
and strength ratings for each vegetable were combined into
a single index. When participants indicated that a cause was
generative, their strength rating was recorded as their score.
When they indicated that a cause was preventive, their score
was computed by multiplying this strength rating by −1.
The data for all cues and conditions were compared with
the SS power model (described above). For modeling
purposes we simply set α = 5 (the value estimated for the
data sets reported by Lu et al., 2008), thus avoiding any
need to fit a free parameter to the present data. We also
compared the human data to an otherwise identical model
assuming uniform priors (i.e., α = 0). Figure 2 shows the
data for the critical A cue, along with the predictions
derived from the two models. Participants in the strong-B
condition underestimated the strength of cause A relative to
participants in the weak-B condition, F(1, 99) = 4.89, p =
.029. There was no significant main effect of block (F(2,
198) = 0.83, p = .437) for A ratings, nor was there a
significant interaction between block and condition (F(2,

Qualitatively, the SS power model predicts the observed
difference in the judged strength of A in the weak-B versus
strong-B conditions more accurately (r = .67) than does the
model with uniform priors (r = .15). However, the SS prior
model also predicts that this competition effect will
diminish (though not disappear) as participants view a
second and third block of trials. The lack of a significant
interaction indicates that this second prediction was not
confirmed. Rather, the competition effect observed in the
human data remained statistically constant across the three
blocks.
Additional analyses were performed on responses to all
three causal cues. Table 2 presents the mean ratings of
causal strength obtained for the three different cues in each
condition, along with the predictions derived from the two
models based on alternative priors. Analyses of participants’
ratings for cause B revealed a somewhat puzzling pattern of
results. As expected, an ANOVA revealed a strong effect of
condition, with participants rating cause B as a stronger
preventer in the strong-B condition than in the weak-B
condition, F(1, 99) = 31.90, p < .001. However, this analysis
also revealed a significant main effect across blocks (F(2,
198) = 12.31, p < .01), as well as a significant interaction
between block and condition (F(2, 198) = 11.68, p < .01).
As is apparent in Table 2, in the strong-B condition
participants’ ratings remained stable across blocks, but in
the weak-B condition participants rated cause B as a weaker
preventer in later blocks than in earlier blocks. Neither
model predicts this trend. The fact that in the weak-B
condition the estimated strength of B approached zero
across blocks (rather than its objective value of −.25)
suggests that some participants may have decided at some
point that the weaker preventer (i.e., cue B) was simply not
a cause at all, and then ceased to attend to the cue. Further,
the effect of this error could then be magnified due to a
demand pressure to give non-zero responses when presented
with the strength question. (Across all vegetables, less than
7% of strength ratings were below an absolute value of 25.)

The present experiment provides support for the generality
of a parsimony constraint on estimates of causal strength.
Previous demonstrations of cue competition between
independently-occurring causes only involved generative
causes. Our study found similar competition effects among
preventive causes, as predicted by a Bayesian model of
causal learning that assumes sparse-and-strong priors.. A
preventive cause of moderate strength was judged to be
weaker when a competing (but uncorrelated) preventive
cause was strong than when the competing cause was weak.
This competition dynamic cannot be explained by naïve
Bayesian models that assume uninformative priors
(Busemeyer et al., 1993).

The competition effect we observed between
two preventive causes was more persistent than that
observed in a previous study using a setup involving similar
contingencies among generative causes (Powell et al.,
2013). For generative causes, competition was observed
only in the first block (of 44 trials); for preventive causes, it
persisted across three blocks of 40 trials each. The model
with SS priors predicted that the competition effect for
preventive causes would persist but diminish across three
blocks.
The greater persistence of generic priors in the
preventive case might reflect the greater cognitive load
imposed by a causal model in which polarity of multiple
causes is uncertain. Perhaps some participants coped with
this complexity by performing model selection (Griffiths &
Tenenbaum, 2005) early on, thereby simplifying their causal
model. In particular, if the B cause was sometimes dropped
from the model in the weak-B condition (i.e., participants
decided weak B was not a cause at all), this could account
for why competition was persistent (A would always have
an advantage if B was dropped, thus favoring A in the
weak-B condition relative to the strong-B condition), and
also why the judged strength of the weak B cue tended
towards 0, rather than its true value of −.25. This hypothesis
could be tested by adding an explicit non-causal response
option for each cause (e.g., “vegetable B is not a cause”).
Our findings thus highlight the need for further work on
causal learning in complex, multi-causal setups with mixed
causal polarities.
