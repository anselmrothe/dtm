something), and that all button on the toy look identical, you
might guess that the rest of the buttons also play a sound.
Suppose however, unbeknownst to you, these toys always
have only three buttons that play music and the rest are
inert. In order for you to learn this the first time, the
informant might show every single button on the toy: both
those that work and those that don’t. However, once you
learn that these toys have just a few working buttons, you no
longer need to see every single button on a new toy of this
kind; observing three buttons that play music is enough for
you to reliably infer that the remaining 17 buttons don’t do
anything. In fact, demonstrating (and observing) 3 buttons is
substantially easier and quicker than demonstrating and
observing 20 buttons, especially when 17 of them don’t do
anything exciting. Thus it is not only enough but also more
desirable for you as the learner and for the informant. This
example illustrates that the consequence of omitting
information depends on the learner’s prior knowledge. A
good teacher should consider both the learner’s prior
knowledge and the cost of information to decide how much
information to provide.

always better? Or do children understand that the amount of              Figure 1. Toys and puppets used in Experiments 1 and 2.
