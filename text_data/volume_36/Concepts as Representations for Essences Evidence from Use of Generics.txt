the proportion of sentences that were generic.

suggested by descriptivist accounts, then no difference
should exist between these two cases. If, however,
participants by default adopt an explanatory approach to
observable regularities – i.e., they take the regularities as
evidence for a further property that serves as the common
cause/explanation of the observed correlated traits – then a
difference should exist in the proportion of generic
sentences between the two conditions. Specifically,
participants who were simply shown the regularity should

be different each day.” Comprehension checks were made to
