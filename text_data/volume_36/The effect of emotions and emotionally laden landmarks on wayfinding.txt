Abstract
Emotions have an influence on attention, decision making, and
memory (all factors required for wayfinding). It is assumed that
both an emotional state and emotionally laden landmarks have an
impact on wayfinding and on later recollection of the path. We
performed two experiments to investigate our hypotheses. First, in
both experiments participants had to study a route in a virtual
environment including landmarks. Then they passed a recognition
and wayfinding task, which was repeated after one week. The
mood was measured using the PANAS scale. In the first
experiment the emotionally laden landmarks were used as a
between-subject factor in order to investigate the effect of mood in
wayfinding. The aim of the second experiment was to examine the
effect of emotionallly laden landmarks (within-subject factor)
without affecting the emotional state. Results show that emotions
have no significant effect on correct recognition, wayfinding and
response times (Experiment 1). For Experiment 2 the results show
that the best wayfinding performance occurs when negatively
laden landmarks were used. Recognition performance was similar,
however, hardly decreased over time for the negative stimuli.
These findings are discussed within the current research literature.
Keywords: landmark; emotions; mood; wayfinding

Introduction
Spatial cognition is indispensable for successful mastery of
our daily life and yet it seems to be almost always
unconscious. Well-known paths become automated with
time and require less working memory capacities, enabling
us to pay more attention to other things. When it comes to
taking new directions our undivided attention, as well as
greater working memory capacities are necessary to avoid
getting lost (Montello, 2009). Navigationally relevant
information needs to be stored and becomes available later
on. Landmarks serve as anchors in our mental representation
of the physical environment and are used in the
communication of route directions (e.g., Raubal & Winter,
2002). A landmark is an object or structure that marks a
locality and is used as a point of reference. Everything that
“stands out” from a scene can be a landmark (e.g., Caduff &
Timpf, 2008).

Landmark salience
Landmarks should be salient. This means that an object
needs to be conspicuous and pops out in comparison to
other surrounding objects (Caduff & Timpf, 2008). The
salience of objects is determined by structural, visual and

cognitive (semantic) qualities (e.g., Caduff & Timpf, 2008).
Objects are called structurally salient, “if their location is
cognitively or linguistically easy to conceptualize in route
directions” (Klippel & Winter, 2005; p. 1) or if they have a
prominent spatial location (Raubal & Winter, 2002). Visual
salience includes all visual features of an object such as size,
color, shape, texture or contrast (Caduff & Timpf, 2008).
Cognitively salient landmarks contain a high idiosyncratic
relevance. So the personality of the observer should be
taken into account because cognitive salience mainly
depends on cultural, personal and historical influences.

Emotion and navigation
For successful wayfinding, landmarks have to be stored in
memory. It is of particular interest which physical and
psychological factors affect human wayfinding. So, how
does an object become a landmark? According to the
somatic marker hypothesis (Damasio, 1996), there is a
connection between emotion and cognition in practical
decision making and beyond that emotions are biologically
indispensable to decisions. So each stimulus is ”marked”
with certain visceral and non-visceral perceptions. They can
be both positive and negative (Damasio, 1996). These
perceptions are partly responsible for our decision making
and complement the thinking process.
Montello (2009) distinguishes between long-term
psychological factors, which are character traits of people
and tend to be persistent over time and short-term
psychological factors like illness, fatigue or anxiety. These
short-term psychological factors have in common that they
reduce the attention of the observer (Montello, 2009).
However, in contrast to the other psychological factors
which Montello (2009) described, anxiety is deemed to be a
basic emotion (Ekmann, 1999). Emotions play an important
role in our lives. If we are happy, we perceive our
environment in a different way than when we are sad or
angry. Individuals in a positive mood tend to perceive their
environment more globally, thus their information
processing is less focused and details are blended out.
Negative mood promotes a local focus and more detailed
attention (Gasper & Clore, 2002). According to the feelingas-information-theory (Schwarz & Clore, 1996) people
attend to their feelings as a source of information and the
use of feelings as a source of information follows the same
principles as the use of any other information. Hence a

1880

positive feeling indicates that an object or situation is good
for us. A negative feeling on the other hand signals us to be
careful and attentive. Immediately after learning, emotional
words are remembered worse than neutral words, but neutral
words are recalled better after a time interval of a week
(Parkin, Lewinsohn, & Folkard, 1982) or a month (Bradley
& Baddeley, 1990). Gray (2001) demonstrated that negative
emotional states impair the verbal working memory, but at
the same time improve the spatial working memory. For
positive emotional states the exact opposite can be observed.
It may therefore be assumed that a negative emotional state
might lead to improved navigation performance.
The effect of emotions on wayfinding can be considered
from two different viewpoints: on the one hand landmarks
or the path can trigger mood, such as happiness or sadness,
which may have an impact on wayfinding. On the other
hand the landmark itself can be emotionally laden, such as a
cemetery. With our experiments we try to extend the
concept of salience by the aspect of emotions.

Experiments
The main aim of the present study is to explore how
emotions may influence the recognition of landmarks and
correct wayfinding (performance), decision times for the
recognition of landmarks as well as directional decisions
(response time). Based on the literature review, we assumed
that both a positive and a negative mood would affect
wayfinding. Furthermore, we also assumed that both
positive and negative mood during wayfinding should have
an influence on memory consolidation. Based on
Ebbinghaus` forgetting curve (see Ebbinghaus, 1885),
information mainly gets lost from memory after four to six
days when there is no attempt to retain it. This is why we
repeatedly investigated one week after the experiment (t1) at
t2. To investigate the hypotheses we performed two
experiments. In Experiment 1 we investigated the effect of
an emotional state (positive, negative, neutral) on
wayfinding. In Experiment 2 we investigated the effect of
emotionally laden landmarks on wayfinding without
affecting the emotional state of participants.

Methods
Participants
In each experiment a total of 24 students participated.
Experiment 1: Seventeen females and seven males with a
mean age of 24 years (SD = 3.8). Experment 2: Twenty-two
females and two males with a mean age of 23 years (SD =
2.9). All participants provided informed written consent.
Exclusion criterion was an epilepsy disorder (participant or
close relatives). All had normal or corrected-to-normal
visual acuity and received course credits for participation.

Material
The experiments were performed in the virtual environment
SQUARELAND which was set up with the FreewareSoftware Google SketchUp 6.0® by Google® (Hamburger
& Knauff, 2011). For the current study SQUARELAND was

made up from an 8×8 block maze with a total of 18 Tjunctions. Participants could therefore only choose between
two directions, right or left turn. The outer structure
consisted of concrete walls to generate a neutral maze
(figure 1). To control for landmark position effects (e.g.,
Röser, Hamburger, Krumnack, & Knauff, 2012), landmarks
were placed centrally at the decision points. The eye-height
within the virtual maze was set to 170 cm.

Figure 1: The virtual maze from the participant’s egocentric
perspective with a centrally placed neutral landmark at the
T-junction.
To investigate the effect of emotions on wayfinding, we
used emotionally laden images as landmarks, most of them
were taken from the IAPS Inventory (The International
Affective Picture System; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert,
2008). The IAPS Inventory mainly refers to the U.S.
American context. To ensure that these pictures generate
emotional arousal for our German participants, the valences
of the images were tested in a preliminary study. Twentyfour psychology students rated in a total of 162 positive,
negative and neutral images in a group session using a likert
scale from 1 (very negative) to 9 (very positive). Pictures
with the highest ratings in the pretest were used as
landmarks (in the maze) and as distractors (in the
recognition phase; examples given in figure 2).
Experiment 1 - Mood
The 36 most positive (M = 7.35, SD = 0.27), most negative
(M = 2.27, SD = 0.23) and most neutral (M = 5.08, SD =
0.14) pictures were chosen. Per condition 18 pictures were
used as landmarks while the remaining 18 images of the
same mood condition were used as distractors for the
recognition phase. The pictures were implemented in three
different mazes divided into positive, negative and neutral
mazes (between-subject factor). So in each case 18
emotional images (positiv, negativ, neutral) were positioned
at the decision points. This allowed for a distinction
between the different moods. Positive and negative affect
were measured with the PANAS scale (Positive And
Negative Affect Schedule; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen,
1988; Krohne, Egloff, Kohlmann, & Tausch, 1996).
Experiment 2 – Emotional landmarks
The effect of emotionally laden landmarks on human
wayfinding was investigated while participants were
introduced to all three types of emotional material (positive,
negative, neutral). The 12 most positive (M = 7.63, SD =

1881

0.04), most negative (M = 1.74, SD = 0.05), and most
neutral (M = 5.01, SD = 0.04) pictures were chosen. Six
pictures per mood condition were used as landmarks and the
remaining six images were used as distractors for the
recognition phase. A total of 18 emotional images (six
positiv, six negativ, six neutral) were positioned at the
decision points (within-subject factor). We created two
mirrored mazes to avoid direction- and sequence-effects. So
participants turned left and right equally often. These mazes
were constructed with landmarks (maze 1.1 and maze 2.1)
and with distractors (maze 1.2. and maze 2.2.). Thus, a total
of four different maze versions allowed for a fully balanced
design.
To ensure that mood does not change during the
experiment, participants filled in the German PANAS
version before and after the experiment. For presentation
and data recording SuperLab 4.0 Stimulus Presentation
Software (Cedrus Corporation©) was used.

Figure 2: The most positive (M = 8.12, SD = 0.26), most
neutral (M = 5.0, SD = 0.14) and most negative (M = 1.38,
SD = 0.12) image (from left to right) of the preliminary
study.

Procedure
The group assignment was random. In single sessions the
participants saw a video lasting 4 minutes and 33 seconds
showing the maze once. It was presented on a 230×170
meter projection screen from an egocentric perspective, the
simulated walking speed was 1.5 m/s. In the first phase
participants were asked to learn the path (with landmarks).
After the learning phase a recognition phase followed.
Participants were instructed to distinguish between
landmarks and distractors via the according key presses on a
response pad (RB-530 Cedrus Corporation©). Between
successive pictures a fixation cross was shown for 1500
milliseconds (figure 3).

During the wayfinding phase the participants saw the
video of the maze again, but this time the video stopped at
the decision points were landmarks were presented. Here,
participants were instructed to make a direction decision by
pressing the right or left button on the response pad (RB530 Cedrus Corporation©). If participants chose the wrong
direction, the video continued in the correct direction to
avoid that participants get lost in the virtual environment
(implicit feedback). The recognition and wayfinding phase
were repeated after one week (t2).

Results
Performance (recognition of landmarks and correct
wayfinding) and response time (decision times for the
recognition of landmarks as well as directional decisions) in
the recognition and wayfinding phase were analyzed with an
analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Experiment 1
The mood condition (positive, negative, neutral) served as
the between-subject factor, while the within-subject factor
was the time of measurement (t1 and t2).
Recognition
Performance
Results show that the negative emotional state influenced
participants’ performance in the recognition phase (table 1).

However, the ANOVA showed that the mood condition had
no significant effect on the ability to remember landmarks
and distractors (F(2,16) = 1.459, p = .266) and that there is
no significant interaction between the mood and the time of
measurement (F(2,16) = .778, p = .478) in the recognition
phase. Participants were able to recognize landmarks and
distractors at t1 better than at t2 (F(1,16) = 8.814, p = .010).

Response time
Table 2 shows the differences between the mood categories.
It seems as if emotions affect participants’ response time in
the recognition phase. The ANOVA revealed that the
response time at t1 was significantly shorter than at t2
(F(1,16) = 6.78, p = .021). But there was no significant

difference between the mood conditions (F(2,16) = .596, p =

between mood and time of measurement (F(2,16) = .778, p

Wayfinding
Performance
Performance in the positive condition was 85% (SD = 9.73)
at t1 and 83% (SD = 14.91) at t2. The performance in the
negative condition was 84% (SD = 13.26) at t1 and 71%
(SD = 15.42) at t2. The performance in the neutral condition
at t1 was 81% (SD = 11.52) and 80% (SD = 12.99) at t2.
Even though there is a large difference in the negative
condition an ANOVA for mood during the learning phase
on correct wayfinding (F(2,16) = .440, p = .653) remained
insignificant (due to absent differences for the other two
conditions). Also there were no significant differences
between t1 and t2 (F(1,16) = 3.719, p = .074).
Response time
The descriptive statistics show that the mean response time
of participants in the positive condition was 722 ms (SD =
348.47) at t1 and 930 ms (SD = 731.47) at t2. The response
time in the negative condition was 552 ms (SD = 199.39) at
t1 and 607 ms (SD = 257.24) at t2. The response time in the
neutral condition was 699 ms (SD = 361.07) at t1 and 768
ms (SD = 584.58) at t2. An ANOVA revealed no significant
differences between the learning phase and the wayfinding
phase for the response time (F(2,16) = .460, p = .640) and
there were no significant differences between t1 and t2
(F(1,16) = 1.497 p = .241). Furthermore, there were no
significant interactions between mood conditions and time
of measurement (F(2,16) = .298, p = .747).

factors.
Recognition
Performance
Table 4 shows the differences between mood valences for
recognition performance. An ANOVA revealed that
participants were able to recognize landmarks and
distractors at t1 better than at t2 (F(1,23) = 16.789, p <
.001). However, the mood valences had no significant effect
on the ability to remember landmarks and distractors
(F(2,46) = 0.665, p = .517). There is an interaction between
mood valence and the time of measurement (F(2,46) =
3.625, p = .035) for neutral (t(23) = 2.635; p = .015) and
positive stimuli (t(23) = 4.047; p < .001).

had an influence on participants’ mood.

Response time
The response time at t1 was significantly shorter than at t2
(F(1,23) = 31.209, p < .001) and there was a difference
between the mood valences (F(2,46) = 7.433, p = .002).
Positive (t(23) = 2.874; p = .009) and neutral stimuli (t(23)
= -3.252; p = .004) differed significantly from negative
stimuli. For recognition of negative stimuli (M = 1224.1 ms,

1883

SEM = 73.3) more time was needed than for positive (M =
1120.5 ms, SEM = 49.4) or neutral (M = 1125.5, SEM =
60.7) stimuli.
Wayfinding
Performance
An ANOVA showed that the emotional valence of a
landmark during the learning phase had a significant
influence on correct wayfinding (F(2,46) = 6.688, p = .003).
There were significant differences between t1 and t2
(F(1,23) = 12.236, p = .002). Wayfinding performance with
negative landmarks (M = 89.2 %, SD = 12.6) was
significantly better than with positive (M = 79.2 %, SD =
16.8, t(23) = 2.839; p = .009) or neutral landmarks (M =
77.4 %, SD = 16.8, t(23) = -3.874; p = .001).
Response time
An ANOVA revealed that the emotionally laden landmarks
had a significant influence on response time (F(2,46) =
11.377, p = .001) and that there was a significant difference
between t1 and t2 (F(1,23) = 5.916, p = .023). The response
time for neutral stimuli was significantly longer than for
positive (t(23) = -3977; p = .001) or negative (t(23) = 3.135;
p = .005) stimuli.
PANAS
For t1 and t2 the ANOVA showed no mood differences
before and after testing as assessed by the PANAS
questionnaire (F(1,23) = 0.031, p = .861). Neither the
positive affect (t(23) = -0.629; p = .536) nor the negative
affect (t(23) = 0.630; p = .535) had changed after testing
compared to before testing.

Discussion Experiment 1
Positive and negative emotions do not seem to strongly
affect participants’ wayfinding performance and response
times. The results show no significant interaction between
mood condition and time of measurement. This could be
due to the very high performance in all three conditions.
Nevertheless, the descriptive results show a clear trend. In
the recognition phase participants were able to recollect
negative landmarks and distractors better at t2 than positive
or neutral landmarks and distractors. This supports results of
Parkin et al. (1982) and Bradley and Baddeley (1990),
which indicate that negative associations are remembered
better over time than positive and neutral associations. Yet,
the high recognition rates for negative images do not mean
that they actually serve as good landmarks. In the
wayfinding phase participants in the negative condition
showed lower performance than participants in the positive
or neutral condition, although negative pictures in the
recognition phase were better recollected. If these pictures
were integrated as landmarks in the virtual maze and were
linked to learning a path then the path is remembered worse.
Based on the feeling-as-information-theory a negative mood
signals the person to be careful and attentive (Schwarz &
Clore, 1996), but the increased attention refers to the
negative object (Gasper & Clore, 2002), which in this case

is the landmark. So, for the actual wayfinding task not
enough attentional resources and working memory
capacities seemed to be available, which are essential for
successful wayfinding (Montello, 2009). For both, the
recognition and the wayfinding phase, the response times in
the positive and negative condition were longer than in the
neutral condition. The positive and negative images mostly
show people during social interactions, whereas in the
neutral images individual objects were seen. Therefore, the
positive and negative pictures were also more complex than
the neutral pictures. This could have led to extended
response times. The descriptive results for the PANAS
questionnaire demonstrate mood changes over time.
Participants in the positive condition showed an increase in
positive affect and a decrease in negative affect after testing
compared to before testing. Participants in the negative
condition showed exactly the opposite. For the neutral
condition no mood change was observed.

Discussion Experiment 2
Performance for negative stimuli did not decrease over time.
This result also supports the results of Parkin et al. (1982)
and Bradley and Baddeley (1990), indicating that negative
associations are better remembered over time than positive
and neutral associations. Though, the response times for
negative images in the recognition phase are conspicuous.
Negative landmarks were well recognized but it took
participants longer to respond to negative landmarks. Hence,
participants might be emotionally involved, as the negative
landmarks showed people in violent and traumatic situations
or tortured and abused animals. Herbert, Pauli, and Herbert
(2011) demonstrated that especially negative information is
processed deeper when this negative information has a selfreference. In the wayfinding phase, participants showed
significantly higher performance for negative landmarks
than for positive or neutral landmarks. When positive,
negative and neutral pictures are linked to learning the path
(within-subject), then the path is remembered better with
negative landmarks. According to Carretie, Mercado, Tapia,
and Hinojosa (2001) more and faster attentional resources
are provided for negative stimuli. This did not occur for
non-negative stimuli even if the same amount of emotional
arousal was triggered. Information which is linked to the
highly aroused stimuli is remembered better (Bradley,
Greenwald, Petry, & Lang, 1992). The direction of turn
might be such information. As expected, the evaluation of
the PANAS questionnaire showed no mood change over
time. It can thus be said that information processing did not
change due to mood but because of the emotionality of the
landmarks.

General Discussion
In both experiments a decrease in performance for
recognition and wayfinding was observed. Participants
showed worse performance and required more time to
respond at t2 in comparison to t1, which is in line with the
forgetting curve (Ebbinghaus, 1885). In Experiment 1, a
trend can be observed that negative landmarks were

1884

recollected better than positive landmarks and positive
landmarks were remembered better than neutral landmarks.
But, if these landmarks were integrated in the virtual maze
and were linked to path learning, then the path was
remembered worse. Experiment 2 revealed that participants
show higher wayfinding performance for negative
landmarks than for positive landmarks and a higher
wayfinding performance for positive landmarks than for
neutral landmarks. Furthermore, negative landmarks were
recollected better than positive and neutral landmarks since
recognition performance did not decrease over time. It
therefore seems to play a role whether negative landmarks
were presented alone or in a path together with positive and
neutral landmarks. A possible explanation for this could be
evolutionary benefits. In a negative environment safety
becomes a far higher priority and reaching the destination
quickly and reliably is key for survival. So, in both
experiments the emotionally laden landmarks were
remembered better than the neutral landmarks. This might
indicate that the emotionally laden landmarks had some
idiosyncratic relevance (Caduff & Timpf, 2008). Moreover,
our results support the concept of cognitive (Sorrows &
Hirtle, 1999) and semantic (Klippel & Winter, 2005)
salience. The emotional state of the observer and the
emotional valence of the landmarks contribute to a higher
wayfinding performance and could be seen as another
aspect of cognitive or semantic salience. It might also serve
as a basis for a new landmark salience category: emotional
landmark salience.
