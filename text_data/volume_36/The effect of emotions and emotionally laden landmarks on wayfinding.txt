It may therefore be assumed that a negative emotional state
might lead to improved navigation performance.
    The effect of emotions on wayfinding can be considered
from two different viewpoints: on the one hand landmarks
or the path can trigger mood, such as happiness or sadness,
which may have an impact on wayfinding. On the other
hand the landmark itself can be emotionally laden, such as a
cemetery. With our experiments we try to extend the
concept of salience by the aspect of emotions.                     Figure 1: The virtual maze from the participant’s egocentric
