Relaxation of Constraints
A further analysis was conducted in association with the
dynamic constraint relaxation theory. As mentioned above,
solving the T-puzzle requires violation of both the object-
level and the relational constraints (Suzuki, 2009).
Videotaped data were used to count the numbers of
segments in which violation of these constraints occurred. A
“segment” in this context was deemed to start when one
piece of the puzzle was connected to another piece and to
end when these pieces were separated. Violation of the
object-level constraint refers to the cases in which a piece is
placed in a diagonal orientation, and violation of the
relational constraint refers to the cases in which the
pentagon is connected to another piece with its concave
corner left unfilled. Both successful and non-successful
solvers were included in this analysis. To elucidate the
temporal course of the violation of constraints, the total
number of segments for each constraint and condition was
divided into quarters. Figure 2 depicts mean proportions of
violation for each condition and quarter of segments (Q1 to
Q4). A four-way repeated-measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with hint/no-hint (2), tapping/no-tapping (2), and
success/non-success (with no advice) (2) as between-subject
factors and quarter of segments (4) as a within-subject factor
was conducted for each constraint. The proportions were
arcsine transformed in order to make distributions more                  Figure 3: Temporal course of constraint relaxation
