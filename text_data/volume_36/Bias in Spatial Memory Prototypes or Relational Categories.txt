twice, once followed by the left response dot and once with

Results and Discussion
The same two models used in Experiment 1 were fitted to
individual participant’s responses in Experiment 2, with one
difference. In order to investigate the influence of the cursor
position, the models were each assigned a parameter that
shifted the effective midpoint in the direction of the cursor.
The prototypes were then placed proportionally
symmetrically around this midpoint (say, 40% of the way
from the estimated midpoint to the screen edges on both
sides, although this might not be the same physical
distance). For simplicity, the midpoint bias was assumed to
be symmetric for trials on which the cursor was on the left
or on the right.
   Replicating Experiment 1, estimates were strongly biased
away from the screen’s center, even for stimuli near the
outer boundaries of the display, and the relational model
was the better-fitting model (by a BIC criterion) for 21 of 24
participants (83%). In addition, data from all participants,
presented in Figure 4, indicated a bias in estimates due to
cursor position, especially in the region between the cursors,
for which categorical information (left vs. right) would be
predicted to differ depending on cursor position. To
evaluate this influence, we analyzed the fitted shift of the
category boundary away from the midpoint in response to                    Figure 4. Bias for each of the response dot’s starting
