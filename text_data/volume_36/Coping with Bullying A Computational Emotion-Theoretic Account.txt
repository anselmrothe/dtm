   Clarion-E outlines a means by which the broadly-defined
category of Belief-Desire-Intention (Bratman, 1987), or
BDI, theories may be computationally expressed in a de-
tailed and psychologically plausible fashion. For instance,
using our model, affect may be seen as a reactive conse-
quence of one’s desires, appraisal as a process by which
beliefs and intentions are evaluated and derived, and coping
as the means by which intentions are actualized in the ser-
vice of attending to one’s beliefs and desires.                          Figure 2: Challenge appraisal and coping strategy use.1
