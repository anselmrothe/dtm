Abstract
Poor performance in goal-oriented sensory motor tasks is a
common symptom among depressed individuals. However,
it is unclear what the underlying causes of these deficits are.
Elucidating the underlying mechanisms is an important first
step to develop more targeted behavioral interventions. Here,
using simple motor-control tasks, we propose an inverse optimal control approach to analyze and factorize performance
deficits into two components of subjects’ behaviors: 1) sensory motor speed, 2) reward-processing. In Task 1, subjects
with Beck Depression Inventory score ranging from 0 to 36
were instructed to push a joystick as quickly as possible once
they observe motion onset of a virtual car. In Task 2, they were
instructed to drive a virtual car as quickly as possible and stop
it as close as possible to a stop sign. Based on the continuous
joystick actions for each individual subject, we estimated perceptual motor efficiency parameters and recovered the underlying reward function that best explained the subject’s behavior. Initial results suggest, that relative to healthy controls, depressed individuals: 1) have deficits in sensory-motor processing speed, 2) have different goals but not significantly different
accuracy/effort ratio. The results suggest that inverse optimal
control may be a viable computational approach to quantify
and factorize the underlying causes of sensory motor deficits
in individuals with depression.

Introduction
Depression can affect many facets of daily life. It accounts
for 8.2% of global years lived with a disability (YLDs) in
2010, and has became a worldwide health priority (World
Healthy Organization, 2012). In particular, growing evidences show depression increases the odds ratio for a car accident (Chapman & Perry, 2008), and reduces driving performance in a driving simulator (Wingen et al. 2006). For
instance, Selzer etl al. (1968) reported for fatal driving accidents, 21% of drivers were clinically depressed, compared
with 7% in healthy controls. Hilton et al. (2009) reported
severe and very severe depression was associated with an increased odds ratio for being involved in an accident or near
miss in the past 28 days. In a driving simulator, Bulmash et

al. (2006) found depressed individuals exhibited slower reaction times and increased number of crashes when compared
to controls. Despite compelling evidence of the severe consequences from poor motor-control in depressed individuals,
the influence of depressive mood on driving actions remains
largely unknown. However, so far, there are few studies (clinical or basic) have emphasized this issue.
Driving task is a closed-loop feedback control process
(Lenard Evans, 2004).
Drivers assess current driving
environment from sensory feedback, and make control
commands based on the goal. The decisions a driver makes
given a task are in a hierarchical system (Janssen 1979) that
comprises 1) a strategic level that is associated with one’s
goal in driving (motivation) and 2) a control level that is
associated with one’s sensorimotor skills (perceiving sensory
feedback and executing motor commands). Thus depressive
symptoms that influence those two levels can lead to different
driving behavior.
Motivation deficits in depression It has been shown that
depressed individuals have greater sensitivity to risk and punishment (Trew 2011), while risk is the most common of all the
motivations considered by driving researchers. Risk homeostatis theory (Taylor, 1964) postulated that drivers adjust their
speed in accordance with the perceived risk. However, risk
perception differs greatly among individuals. It is affected
not only by the objective danger in the situation (weather,
road condition), but also by the driver’s own assessment of
his or her actions (e.g., driving faster than legal speed limit).
Thus for a driving task that is considered almost as risk-less
to an experienced F1 driver, it may be perceived as highly
risky to depressed individuals.
Recently, Wilde (2002) proposed that we drive not to minimize risk (or maximize safety), but to reduce or increase it
to a desired risk level with which we feel comfortable. The
target level of risk varies among drivers. For young drivers

2387

who are more risk seeking than others, they may set a higher
level of risk to fulfill the thrill of driving. However, for depressed individuals who are oversensitive to punishment, they
probably have a different driving style that targets a lower
risk level. In other words, they may have differences in
reward-processing that favors goals with lower risk. In this
study, we will investigate what are the differences in their
reward-processing, how that influences their driving actions,
and what it implies about their risk sensitivity.
Psychomotor disturbance On the other hand, depressed
individuals suffer from psychomotor disturbance (Buyukdura
et al. 2011). Behavioral experiments have suggested impairments in sensorimotor system among depressed individuals.
Caligiuri & Ellwanger (2000) showed that depressed individuals have difficulties performing normal physical actions,
such as simple motor learning tasks. Sabbe et al. (1999)
used simple drawing tasks and showed that MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) patients exhibited marked motor deficits of
the visuomotor control process (longer movement duration,
longer pauses, and lower velocities). Those sensorimotor impairments will adversely affect how one responses to sensory
feedback and executes motor commands in driving tasks.
Thus, poor motor-performance may be a consequence of
mixed depressive symptoms. It could be due to 1) different targeted risk level (goals), and/or 2) impaired sensorimotor system. Our study aims to provide a computational approach (inverse reinforcement learning) to disentangle these
processes.

Inverse Optimal Control
In optimal control theory (inverse reinforcement learning at
continuous time), actions are chosen to optimize a performance criterion (Todorov & Jordan 2002). The performance
criterion is defined as a reward-function that includes taskrelated performance measure and action cost. For example,
in a task that instructs subjects to drive to a location A as
quickly as possible, the performance measure can be the stopping distance to A, and the action cost can be the accumulated
effort of accelerating and decelerating controls. Different individuals may have different target stopping distance to A,
and different weights to assess the ratio of the closeness to
the target location over the action cost (i.e. accuracy/effort
ratio), thereby forming different reward-functions.
With different reward-functions in mind, there will be
different action-planning strategies, which are defined as
control-policies. A control-policy comprises a series of dynamic decisions modulating actions at given states in continuous time (Shadmehr 2008). In a forward model, with experimentally defined reward function (for example, points),
we can derive the optimal control-policy to optimize the reward function. In an inverse model (Ng & Russell, 2000),
with observed continuous actions, we can infer the controlpolicy, and recover the reward-function used in developing
this control-policy. Thus the objective of inverse optimal control is to infer individuals’ reward-function based on observed

behaviors. This approach will provide a quantitive comparison of how different reward-processing between depressed
and healthy controls lead to observed behavioral differences.
In summary, we will apply inverse reinforcement learning
approach to investigate how reward-processing and sensorimotor impairments in depressed individuals influence their
motor control in a simulated driving task.

Method
Participants
58 college students (15 male and 43 female subjects) in
UCSD participated this study in fall quarter 2013. They
signed up through UCSD SONA system, and then completed
phone-screening and on-line BDI (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI-II, Beck et al. 1996) measure. Qualified subjects
completed the experiment (with a second BDI measure prior
to the task) in the lab, and were compensated by 2 course
credits. Their onsite BDI range from 0 to 36 with mean
BDI=10.25 (std=8.38), median BDI=8.

Experiment
Subjects were instructed to complete two tasks in this experiment. Both tasks were computer experiments (on a 15
inch MacBook Pro) programmed in Matlab. We recorded
their continuous actions using a gaming joystick (Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog Flight Stick). The goal of Task 1
(Move-and-Go) is to measure individual’s perceptual and motor speed (without risk influence), and the goal of Task 2
(Speed-and-Stop) is to apply inverse optimal control model
to recover reward-function (with risk influence).
Task 1: Move-and-Go Subjects were required to perform
Task 1 twice (120 trials, before and after Task 2). In each trial
(Figure 1), a car would appear on the bottom of the screen,
and subjects were instructed to push the joystick from resting
position forward to the maximum position as quickly as possible once they observe the car move. Each trial started with a
3-second countdown and a random waiting interval (1-3 seconds), then the car would start to move at a randomly selected
speed (.01-.3 cm/second). Trials ended once subjects pushed
the joystick at its maximum forward position. The goal in
this task is risk-free, thus parameters estimated here can be
considered to represent basic sensorimotor skills.
Task 2: Speed-and-Stop There were 3 blocks, with 20 trials/block in Task 2. In each trial (Figure 2), subjects were
instructed to drive a virtual car as quickly as possible to a
stop sign (distance: 10.62 cm) without crossing the stop-line,
and stop there within a 10-second time window. Each trial
started with a 3-second countdown and ended when time ran
out, with no performance feedback (e.g., points) in the end.
The car has a linear dynamic system (see Model), in which
the car position is controlled by continuous joystick position.

Task 1 (move-and-go) was designed to estimate perceptual

speed γ and motor speed β. We model subjects’ perceived car
position Yt as a delayed true car position Xt due to the limit
of sensory processing speed γ (Eq.1). The higher the γ, the
closer the perceived car position Yt to the true car position Xt .
We assume subjects will decide the car starts moving once the
perceived car position Yt reaches a position threshold Xthd .
Thus the minimal time for the perceived car position Yt to
reach the threshold Xthd is reaction time tRT (Equation 2):
Perceived car position Yt : dYt = γ(Xt −Yt )dt
There were 3 blocks, with 20 trials/block in task 2 (about 25 minutes to complete). In
each trial, subjects were instructed to drive a virtual car using a joystick, to a stop-sign

(distance: 10.6202 cm/ 465 pixels) as quickly and stop as closely to the stop-sign as
possible within a 10s time-window. Each trial starts with 3 seconds count-down and
ends when time runs out, with no performance feedback in the end. The car has a linear
dynamic system, in which car position is controlled by velocity changes through joystick
action. We recorded subjects’ continuous control on the joystick, and their facial
expression during the task.

sends the motor command to muscles to generate the movement. Then the state estimator will update the efference copy
with the delayed sensory observation to predict state at next
time point t + 1 and the optimal controller will generate new
motor commands until the goal is reached.
We propose to use inverse optimal control model to explain observed behavior in this feedback control process. To
achieve that, we first assessed individual’s sensorimotor system by estimating their perceptual speed (delay in perceiving
sensory observation at time t) and motor speed (delay in executing motor command at time t) in a risk-free task (Task
1: move-and-go). Then we estimated their target state (target
stopping distance) and target accuracy/effort ratio (the willingness to reach the target state) in the reward function in
Task 2 (speed-and-stop) with the perceptual and motor delay
parameters from Task 1.

t

We model joystick position Ct as a delayed execution from
target joystick position Utarget , due to the limit of motor execution speed β (Equation 3). The higher the β, the closer
joystick action to the desired target position. Thus the minimal time for Ct to reach Utarget is movement time (Equation
4).

In above equations, Xt (true car position), tRT (reaction time
to car motion-onset), Ct (recorded joystick position), Utarget
(target position) and tMT (movement time) are known. We
use tRT and Xt to recover Xthd , γ and Yt , and use Ct and tMT
to recover β, by optimizing over γ, Xthd , and β to give the
minimal errors between predicted tRT , tMT and observed data.

Inverse optimal control of the driving task
Task 2 (speed-and-stop) was designed to estimate individual’s
reward-function, which is a function of target stopping distance and accuracy/effort ratio. Target stopping distance measures individual’s risk sensitivity. The further away one aims
to stop from the stop sign, the less risk there is to cross the
stop-line. Target accuracy/effort ratio measures individual’s
willingness to reach the target stopping distance. The higher

2389

the ratio, the more motivated one is to stop as close as possible to the target stopping location. In a quadratic reward
function, target distance represents the optimal point of the
reward function, and target accuracy/effort ratio represents
the hessian of the reward function.

With:

Linear Quadratic Gaussian Model (LQG) We formulate
the driving task as a LQG problem with a linear dynamic system and a quadratic reward function. In forward LQG problems, the optimal controller generates an optimal control policy that maximizes a given reward function. Figure 4 shows
in a forward model of this driving task, how different model
parameters (motor speed β, target accuracy/effort ratio P, and
target stopping distance Xtarget ) can affect optimal car position and joystick control. In inverse LQG problems, we use
observed movements to infer the underlying reward function
that best explains the observed behavior.

the states and K can be estimated from Ut and recorded behavior data through linear regression. This suggests a quadratic
value function:
1

(13)

Then the HJB equation (Bellman, 1957) for this linear system will give us g(x̂) as a quadratic form of x̂:
1
g(x̂) = − x̂0 (−2A0 w + k0 k)x̂
2

Linear dynamic system Assuming the driving task as a linear dynamic system (Equation 5) with a partial hidden state
Xt and observable feedback Zt , in which Xt is a 3x1 vector
including the (hidden) true car distance to target stopping position at time t, joystick action at time t, and perceived car
distance to target stopping position at time t.

Observation: Zt = CXt +Vt

(10)

Without loss of generality, let q = 1 (i.e. optimal action will
not change if scaling the reward function), thus g(Xt ) is a
function of target state and target accuracy/effort ratio. We
assume subjects were using a stationary (infinite horizon) policy and the reward function has a diagonal form (i.e. no joint
influence between state elements in the reward function).
In LQG setting, subjects first estimate true state from observation using a Kalman filter to convert the problem to a
fully observable system, and then solve it as a LQR (LinearQuadratic-Regulator) problem:

In which, a, b are car dynamics parameters (assuming

the state Xt , the hidden true car position and perceived car
position are measured as a distance to target stopping position (parametrized as the target state in the reward function),
which we will estimate through optimization from this model.

Discussion
In this paper, we proposed to use a simulated driving task and
the inverse optimal control approach to examine the influence
of depressed mood in motor-control in continuous time. We
found depressed group has 1) slower perceptual and motor
reaction time, 2) different behavioral goals but no significant
difference in accuracy/effort ratio.
Our approach provided a computational framework to disentangle the factors between perceptual-motor speed and reward function in goal-directed motor-control tasks. The
findings of slower perceptual-motor processing are consis-

2391

tent with symptoms of psychomotor disturbance in depressed
individuals (Treadway et al. 2009). Taking account of
perceptual-motor speed in the feedback control loop, the findings of different reward-processing using inverse LQG model
provided quantitative explanations of how different target
states and target accuracy/effort ratio will influence motorcontrol in continuous time. However, these findings need to
be interpreted with caution and require further investigation.
Target stopping distance If interpreting the intention of
stopping further away from stop sign as to avoid crossing the
stop-line, then our finding supports previous research showing depressed individuals have greater sensitivity to risk and
punishment. However, it is important to consider other possible interpretations (Eshel & Roiser, 2010). In particular, one
can argue that depressed individuals may have decreasing interest to perform the task due to anhedonia (Der-Avakian et al.
2012). Further research will be done to investigate this issue
(risk-averse vs. disengagement from task due to anhedonia).
Target accuracy/effort ratio Our group-level comparison
result suggests depression influences what goals individuals
want to achieve, but not accuracy/effort ratio. This finding
could imply depressed individuals may not necessarily have
less willingness than non-depressed individuals to achieve
their goals. Rather, the differences are in the choice of goals
in a task. However, within depressed group, we also observed
higher variability in both the goals and accuracy/effort ratio,
which indicates high individual differences. Considering the
many subtypes of depression, future research will be focusing on examining those individual differences, by considering
other psychological factors (anxiety, personality traits, etc.)
and use the model to further examine the relationship between
perceptual-motor speed, goals and accuracy/effort ratio.
In conclusion, the combined behavioral and modeling approaches provide a tool to examine if and how the severity of
psychomotor disturbance interacts with motivation deficits in
depressed individuals.
