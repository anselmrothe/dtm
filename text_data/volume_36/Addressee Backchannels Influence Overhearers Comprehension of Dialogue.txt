participants from adopting a strategy of immediate response.
   Design. Three lists were created that contained equal
numbers of specifics, generics, and pauses, as well as equal
numbers of authentic and manipulated audio clips, with no
stimuli created from the same audio being presented
together in the same list. Both filler and target stimuli
contained a number of noncritical backchannels, so it was
unlikely that participants adopted a strategy of listening for
backchannels to predict a word’s occurrence.
   Procedure. Instructions were presented on screen. After
reading the instructions, participants were given four

spoken in the conversation. For critical trials, the target
word was present in the speaker’s turn prior to the critical
backchannel or pause. No other listener feedback, besides
the backchannel of interest in the backchannel conditions,
intervened between the target word and the verification
prompt. The visual prompt was displayed on the screen at
the onset of the target word in the following turn after the
backchannel used in the Experiment 1. This created an
average distance of 14.67 intervening words between target
and memory probe, (average time = 4.18 s). After reading
instructions, participants were given four practice trials
before starting the task. Reaction times were measured from
the onset of the visual display to the button press.
