A key issue in developing problem-solving theories is to
identify human heuristics adopted when solving complex
problems. An example of such problems are the Capacitated
Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRPs), which are hard
optimization problems, where the best solution must be
discovered from a set of candidate solutions too large to
allow exhaustive search.
                                                                           Figure 1: The optimal solution of a CVRP 39-6 problem.

As such, it is unclear as to whether convex-hull-type
heuristics or cross avoidance may lead to near optimal
solutions.
   Under a weak methods account, one may exhibit an
incremental testing of route alternatives leading to purely
satisficing solutions while under a ‘fast and frugal’ account,
rapid solutions with very limited alternatives may be
considered that promote optimality in human solutions.
                     The Experiment
The Experiment asked people to solve CVRPs, while
thinking aloud in order to identify heuristics and strategies
employed during the problem solving process. Task
complexity varied by increasing the number of nodes tours
required in each problem. Human heuristics were identified
based on participants’ verbalizations, on their video-
recordings while solving the problems and on participants’
paper notes.
