   The procedure consisted of (1) a baseline test of looking-
time to matching and non-matching pairs of shapes; (2) a fa-
miliarization period showing only matching shapes; and (3) a
final test of looking-time to matching and non-matching pairs
of shapes. Because the procedures for baseline and final tests
were identical we first address the familiarization period.
Familiarization The familiarization period was intended to
familiarize infants with the concept of two matching shapes if
possible. Images of matching shapes were flashed for 280 ms
each only while the infant was looking at a small, attractive
“fixation video,” which continued to play throughout famil-

   In the ’bilateral’ condition, the images of matching shapes
were on opposite sides of the fixation video, at one and two
units from fixation (the position of the more distant shape
was consistent within subjects and counterbalanced). In the
’unilateral–peripheral’ condition, both matching shapes were
on one side of the central fixation video (side consistent
within subjects and counterbalanced), at distances of one and
two units from the fixation video as in the bilateral condi-

   The question remains of whether infants in the bilateral
condition simultaneously perceive two clear but incompara-
ble shapes, or have separate experiences of seeing each shape
as two separate people might. Experiment 2 addresses per-
ceptual integration more directly in the case of approximate
numerical representations by familiarizing infants with 16
dots either all in one visual hemifield (16+0) or split evenly
between the two hemifields (8+8). We directly predict the
representation that would result from a failure to integrate
information: infants in the 8+8 condition will represent 8,
whereas infants in the 16+0 condition will represent 163 . We
also expect that younger infants will express these represen-
tations via familiarity preferences whereas older infants will
show novelty preferences. That is, we expect that infants in
the 8+8 condition will start off showing a familiarity prefer-
ence for 8 and shift to a novelty preference for 16, whereas
infants in the 16+0 condition will start off showing a famil-             Figure 5: Familiarization with 16 dots. (a) Bilateral (8+8)
