   In order to compare our developmental model to our previ-
ous work, we trained our previous model with the same 250
natural image patches and with 15 connections per hidden
unit, just like the developmental model after pruning occurs.3 .
We verified that the models show qualitatively similar results
in both frequency processing and behavioral modeling as pre-
