  Pantomime, just as well as language, has its own
‘typicalities’. Features, for instance, may differ in their
degree of difficulty to express in pantomime. The pictures
used in the task provide information on the shape of the
objects. Therefore, in this task, shape pantomimes may be
cognitively less effortful than for instance handling
pantomimes. On the other hand, for handling pantomimes
one could propose that this is natural or embodied
movement (something we do in our daily lives as well;
Hostetter & Alibali, 2008). As Ellis and Tucker (2000)
have shown, viewing an object may even prime the
actions associated with grasping the object. This implies
that handling pantomimes could even be naturally evoked
by some of the objects. For shape or object pantomimes
on the other hand one has to perform a ‘new’ action.
Finally, it is unclear to what extent the different features
vary in the degree to which they are ‘cognitively
accessible’. Possibly, some features are accessed more
easily, or faster than others.                                  Figure 4 Participants using a default pantomime technique

representation technique. Second, the pictures used might
influence the conceptualization of the observed object.
For instance, a picture of an igloo, with the entrance
towards the viewer, may elicit other representations
(entering the igloo), than a picture with an entrance facing
the side. However, our data show that our participants
frequently express information through gesture that is not
