Abstract
People naturally and easily establish social groupings based
on appearance, behavior, and other nonverbal signals. However, psychologists have yet to understand how these varied
signals interact. For example, which factor has the strongest
effect on establishing social groups? What happens when two
of the factors conflict? Part of the difficulty of answering these
questions is that people are unique and stochastic stimuli. To
address this problem, we use robots as a visually simple and
precisely controllable platform for examining the relative influence of social grouping features. We examine how behavioral mimicry, similarity of appearance, and direction of gaze
influence peoples’ perception of which group a robot belongs
to. Experimental data shows that behavioral mimicry has the
most dominant influence on social grouping, though this influence is modulated by appearance. Non-mutual gaze was found
to be a weak modulator of the perception of grouping. These
results provide insight into the phenomenon of social grouping, and suggest areas for future exploration.
Keywords: Attention; Mimicry; Appearance; Grouping; Perception.

Introduction
People naturally categorize others into social groups. These
categorizations are made quickly and often depend on superficial factors such as behavioral mimicry, physical similarity, and directed eye gaze. Despite their superficial nature,
social grouping decisions can have lasting impacts on judgments about those groups (Tajfel, 2010).
Behavioral mimicry involves adopting the nonverbal behavior of an interaction partner (Baaren, Janssen, Chartland,
& Dijksterhuis, 2009). Previous research identifies the importance of behavioral mimicry in the perception of human
grouping. According to earlier findings, behavioral mimicry
can be used to include oneself in a social group (Lakin, Chartrand, & Arkin, 2008). Moreover, some argue it facilitates
social communication by increasing affiliation, which results
in strengthened relationships (Lakin, Jefferis, Cheng, & Chartrand, 2003; Stel & Vonk, 2010; Baaren, Holland, Kawakami,
& Knippenberg, 2004). The effects of behavioral mimicry are
not limited to the partners in the exchange. Non-participating
observers are known to view interactions with greater degree of nonverbal mimicry as more positive (Bernieri, Gillis,
Davis, & Grahe, 1996; Parrill & Kimbara, 2006).
Likewise, physical appearance is an important factor, as
research shows that the presence of similarities between the
physical features of interacting parties increases their classification as a cohesive group (Dasgupta, Banaji, & Abelson,
1999). It is suggested that this increase occurs because physical appearance is a salient perceptual feature which evokes

the belief that similar group members also share some psychological characteristics (Campbell, 1958; Duncan, 1976;
Sagar & Schofield, 1980).
Direction of gaze is also identified as a factor in some
social groupings. Groups of interaction partners in a conversational setting are found to be influenced by gaze direction (Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974; Goodwin, 1981).
While there is some evidence that eye gaze may be an influential factor in the perception of human groups, the lack of
support for an effect in a wider range of groupings suggests
that this influence may not be generalized to other types of
groups. However, gaze direction may enhance the influence
of other factors by increasing awareness of them: it is known
to cue the attention of an observer (Hietanen, 1999, 2003)
even at ages as early as 5 months (Scaife & Bruner, 1975;
Farroni, Johnson, Brockbank, & Simion, 2000).
The perception of social interactions and grouping in exchanges between humans and machines can also be influenced by behavior mimicry, appearance, and gaze. The effect of behavioral mimicry is investigated in a study showing that humans rate exchanges in which their facial gestures
are mimicked by a robot as more favorable than those without any mimicry (Riek & Robinson, 2008). There is further
evidence that a seemingly trivial physical similarity, such as
wearing an armband of the same color as a marked computer, induces humans to assess computers of the same color
as more similar to themselves as compared to computers of
different colors (Nass & Moon, 2000). Another recent study
suggests that variations in the proportion of interaction time
during which a robot’s gaze is directed towards a person can
influence whether that person feels like a member of a group
(Mutlu, Shiwa, Kanda, Ishiguro, & Hagita, 2009).
While previous studies have examined the influence of behavioral mimicry, physical appearance, and gaze in perceiving both human and human-robot groupings, none have explored more than one of these important factors at a time.
The current experiment systematically varied these factors in
order to determine their relative importance.
Robots provide an excellent platform for testing such effects. Because their appearance and behavior can be precisely manipulated, robots allow researchers to perform studies that involve carefully varying multiple factors. Additionally, anatomically realistic motions enhance the impression of
agency (MacDorman, 2006), thereby increasing the possibility of generalization to human social interaction.
Our hypotheses were as follows:

1060

Figure 2: The move combinations used for creating dances
for the robots.
Figure 1: A sample screenshot from the videos shown to the
participants.

H1 Behavioral mimicry will positively influence the perception of robot groupings.
H2 Similarity of physical appearance will positively influence the perception of robot groupings.
H3 Gaze will increase attention to a factor, and will therefore increase the effect of any present mimicry or physical
similarity.
To test these hypotheses, we generated short video clips
showing three robots that looked and behaved in systematically manipulated ways (Figure 1). Two of the robots
were “leading” robots, and always performed distinct dances,
wore different colors, and were oriented towards the observing human participant. The third robot, the “follower,” either assumed some of the leaders’ characteristics or exhibited
unique ones. Participants were asked to group the follower
with exactly one of the leaders. By evaluating participants’
choices with respect to the presence of behavioral mimicry,
physical similarities, and directed gaze, we investigated the
individual and interaction effects of these three factors.

Methods
The experiment was designed to evaluate the relative influences of the three factors identified earlier on the phenomenon of social grouping. Each of these factors was a
variable in this experiment, with carefully selected settings
to identify their individual influences on the perception of
grouping as well as their interactions.
We presented participants with a series of short video clips
featuring three robots. At the conclusion of each video, participants were asked to decide whether one of the robots, a
“follower” (identified as robot C) belonged in a group with
one robot leader (identified as A) or a different leader (identified as B). This data allowed us to identify the relative effect
of each factor in peoples’ evaluations of social groupings.

Stimuli
The robots used for this experiment were modified MyKeepon robots (made by BeatBots LLC), physically similar,
consumer-grade versions of the research-grade Keepon Pro

robot. Keepon robots are designed for human-robot interaction studies (Kozima, Michalowski, & Nakagawa, 2009).
Their minimalist exterior design and simple kinematics make
them excellent stimuli for expressing attention and for differentiating their appearance with added “clothes.”
We modified the 7-inch tall, snowman-shaped, interactive toy to give individual control over its three DC motors.
The three motors are capable of performing four unique motions: pan (around the base), roll (left/right lean), bob (up and
down), and pitch (front/back lean). Using three of these primitives (Figure 2) in different combinations, we generated three
unique robot “dances”. Dances are short, fixed sequences of
moves that repeat over the duration of the video clip, for instance, lean left then lean right. These simple sequences are
easy to identify as distinct dances.
The robots in the videos varied along three dimensions,
corresponding to the three experimental variables. Each variable had three possible settings: C matched A, C matched
B, or C was neutral compared to A and B. Robots A and B
always had different appearances and dances . The possible
settings for the three variables are shown in Figure 3.
Behavioral mimicry. The first variable was the “behavior” of robot C, which was the dance that robot C performed.
When C followed another robot’s motions, it made identical
movements to that robot with a small (two second) delay, to
elicit the appearance of mimicry (Figure 3a).
Appearance. The second variable was appearance, which
was varied using differently-colored “scarves” and “belts”
around the necks and midsections of the robots (Figure 3b).
Eye gaze. The third variable was the direction of robot C’s
gaze during the video. To evoke the appearance of “looking
at” one of the other robots, C oriented its eyes and body toward that robot (Figure 3c). In the neutral setting (looking
straight ahead), robot C’s gaze direction is the same as both
leaders’, providing no bias towards either.
Each combination of variable settings constituted an experimental “condition”. We recorded one 30-second video clip
for every condition for a total of 27 videos. For each video,
we carefully manipulated the display to avoid any potential
bias toward a particular robot or condition. Table 1 shows a
list of all the 27 experimental conditions.

1061

(a) Behavior: Robot A and Robot B always
performed the indicated dances, while Robot
C’s dances matched A, B, or neither.

(b) Appearance: Robot A always wore blue
bands; robot B always wore red bands; robot
C wore blue, red, or white bands.

(c) Gaze: Robot C either looks towards A,
looks towards B, or looks towards the observer.

Figure 3: Three factors affecting social interaction (behavioral mimicry, physical appearance, and gaze) were the dependent
variables in this experiment. Each variable had three possible values, shown here.

Procedure
We recruited 103 participants (49 females) online from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. They were compensated $2.50 for
their time during the experiment. Each participant was randomly assigned three sets of three videos. In each set, among
the three video conditions, one of the experimental variables
was constant while the other two variables had randomlyassigned values. Thus, each participant viewed nine of the
27 available videos.
After each video clip (Figure 1), the participant was asked
to answer the question: “Whose group does Keepon C belong to?” This was a forced-choice response with only two
options: “Robot A” and “Robot B.” The next clip was shown
only after the participant answered the question.
As a stimulus check, participants viewed six additional
videos following the nine experimental videos. These videos
were similar to the experimental videos, albeit shorter, and
were followed by explicit questions about the video content:
“Who is C looking at?”, “Who is C dancing like?”, and “Who
does C dress like?”. This stimulus-check enabled us to remove data from participants who were unable to interpret the
factors appropriately for instance, not interpreting the robot’s
gaze as the orientation of its body and eyes.

Results
The raw experimental data of the responses for each experimental condition is shown in Table 1. Of the 103 initial participants, we excluded six (5.8%) for failing stimulus checks.
We analyzed the responses of the remaining 97 participants.
Manipulation checks. First, we evaluated whether participants showed any overall preference for choice A or B by
comparing the number of responses for each group across all
videos. We found no significant difference between grouping decisions (A or B) for all possible conditions considered

together, χ2 (1, N = 873) = 2.979, p = ns, indicating that any
difference in grouping responses was not due to innate user
preferences for one group.
A second check evaluated if the neutral condition for behavior, appearance, and gaze was biased towards either A
or B. For each variable, we compared responses for conditions in which robot C displays a unique setting. In other
words, we analyzed grouping responses on conditions represented by lines in Table 1 that have a “C” only in the column representing our variable of interest, and in no other
columns. We found no statistical grouping preference for
unique appearance (χ2 (1, N = 291) = 0.99, p = ns) or for
gaze (χ2 (1, N = 291) = 0.77, p = ns). For unique behavior,
this analysis showed a statistically significant bias towards
response B (χ2 (1, N = 291) = 16.36, p < 0.01). This bias
is readily visible from condition 27 in Table 1. Notice that
the unique behavior for robot C was generated by merging
the motion primitives from the distinct dances of robots A
and B. The manipulation check suggests that the motions of
robot B’s dance were more prominent in the “unique” dance
generated for robot C. This could be due to a difference in
the visual salience of the motion primitives from robot B’s
dance. Since the unique dance behavior for robot C showed a
statistically significant bias toward B, we did not perform any
analysis that relied on the uniqueness of robot C’s “neutral”
dance behavior.
Independent features. The influence of each experimental variable on the grouping responses is shown in Figure 4.
We calculated the proportion of responses influenced by a
given factor x by computing the fraction of all responses that
assigned Robot C to the same group as the robot that also exhibits x. For example, if robot C’s behavior matched A’s, the
proportion of responses influenced by C and A’s behavior is
the number of responses that grouped C and A, divided by the

Discussion

Table 1: Raw results from the experiment. Each row is a
condition, and columns 2, 3, and 4 show the variable settings.
Responses for each condition are in the right two columns.

total number of responses.
The results in Figure 4 show that behavior significantly
influenced grouping, χ2 (1, N = 582) = 9.83, p < 0.01. The
influence of appearance on grouping was marginally significant, χ2 (1, N = 582) = 3.16, p = 0.075. The influence
of gaze, however, was not significant, χ2 (1, N = 582) =
0.00035, p = ns.
Paired features. It is possible that the experimental variables acted in concert to influence each choice of perceived
grouping. To obtain information into these cross-relations,
we considered the factors pairwise (Figure 5). There was
a significant decrease in positive grouping responses based
on similar behavior when behavior and appearance were in
conflict (Figure 5b), indicating that appearance mediated the
effect of behavioral similarity, χ2 (1, N = 327) = 21.0, p <
0.01. However, when appearance and behavior conflicted,
responses supporting behavior were statistically more likely
than responses supporting appearance, χ2 (1, N = 186) =
18.09, p < 0.01 (Figure 5a), indicating that behavior overwhelmed appearance in determinations of grouping.
There was no significant difference in grouping when behavior and gaze were in conflict, χ2 (1, N = 330) = 0.436, p =
ns, as well as when appearance and gaze were in conflict,
χ2 (1, N = 287) = 0.784, p = ns. Thus, gaze did not mediate
the influence of either behavior or appearance on grouping.

Results of the experiment suggested that behavioral mimicry
has a significant influence on the perception of robotic grouping, outweighing the other physical and cognitive factors
(Figure 4), thereby supporting hypothesis H1. We showed
that appearance has a marginal but notable effect on the perception of robotic grouping, partially supporting H2. Gaze
was seen to be a very weak factor and did not appear to influence peoples’ perceptions of grouping, leading us to reject
hypothesis H3. It is important to note that each of the three
variables were able to influence decisions when they were
present without conflicts from the other variables. Comparing choices based on single variables while others are neutral
demonstrates the effect of each variable individually: conditions 9 and 18 (behavior), conditions 21 and 24 (appearance)
and conditions 25 and 26 (gaze) show that apart from gaze,
each variable is perceptually salient and able to influence a
participant in the absence of other cues.
Our experiment supports the findings of previous studies
that identify behavioral mimicry (Riek & Robinson, 2008)
and physical similarity (Nass & Moon, 2000) as strong factors in grouping perception. Our findings add to the literature
by establishing behavior mimicry as a more influential factor
than appearance in robot groupings, and suggests the need to
explore such influence among human interactions.
Figure 5a illustrates the interactions between pairs of features, which elucidated not only the independent effect of
each feature, but also the interaction of these effects during
grouping. The distribution of responses for interactions between behavior and appearance is depicted in the first pair
of bars. Behavior and appearance responses tallied together
show no correlation (χ2 (1, N = 393) = 1.22, p = ns), establishing that behavioral mimicry and appearance-matching
were able to independently influence the observers’ perceptions of groups. Furthermore, these results show that when C
imitated both the appearance and behavior of a leading robot,
nearly 100% of all responses grouped C with the mimicked

1063

(a) The percentage of responses for cross-conditions, either in
alignment or at odds, are shown in each pair of bars. Matching
appearance and behavior (at some X) achieved a high percentage
of votes for X and low percentage at for any Y (bar 1). Conflict of
appearance with behavior X gave fewer responses for X (bar 2).
Similar comparisons are made for all three conflict conditions.

(b) The difference made by the second factor conflicting with
the first for each conflict comparison in (a). Appearance lowers
a high proportion of responses from behavior when in conflict.
Gaze lowers a statistically insignificant proportion of responses
from both behavior and appearance.

robot (Figure 5a, bar 1). Alignment of behavioral mimicry
and physical appearance was overwhelmingly influential.
In contrast, conflicting appearance and behavior caused a
significantly less decisive split in the percentage of responses
grouping C with either leaders. Responses grouping C with
the leader of the same appearance as C increased to nearly
35%, while responses grouping C with the robot behaving
like C decreased to 65% (Figure 5a, bar 2). The relative
change in responses matching behavior when cues conflicted
suggests the effect of appearance was weaker than that of behavior. Future work should investigate the minimum amount
of behavioral mimicry that continues to have such an effect.
Examining behavior and gaze in a similar way (second pair
of bars in Figure 5a) reinforces the earlier observation that
gaze had a weak influence on grouping. Though the results
show that a large proportion of participants grouped C with
the leader towards whom C’s gaze was directed and whose
behavior C imitated (Figure 5a, bar 3), these results were independently incapable of determining the strength of gaze’s
effect because behavior had a powerful influence on perception. We next considered trials in which behavior and gaze
opposed each other (Figure 5a, bar 4). If gaze had a significant influence, the conflict between these two factors would
decrease the proportion of grouping responses in favor of
either factor. However, responses in line with behavior remained high, and those in favor of gaze remained low (Figure
5b). We conclude that C’s direction of gaze is nearly irrelevant to grouping patterns and it does not independently influence the perception of grouping.
The pairings of appearance and gaze, both in agreement
and in conflict (bar 6 and 7 in Figure 5a), show similar trends
as behavior and gaze. While there was a decreased proportion

of responses for appearance, likely due to the dominance of
behavior, the results still show an insensitivity to gaze.
Initial statistical analysis confirmed that there was no significant bias towards any individual setting of behavior, appearance, or gaze direction. Additionally, to enable the perception of directed gaze and mimicry, the leader robots were
positioned equidistantly in front of the follower; the follower
began its dance approximately 2 seconds after the leaders.
While the delayed start of the follower may have induced participants to be especially attentive to behavior, it provided for
a more ecologically-valid mimicry of behavior where some
time is necessary for the leader to be observed and imitated.
While both one-directional (Naiman & Breed, 1974; Hietanen, 1999, 2003; Scaife & Bruner, 1975; Farroni et al., 2000;
Langton, Watt, & Bruce, 2000) and mutual gaze (Naiman
& Breed, 1974) are shown to be strong factors in perceiving human interactions, the current experiment investigated
one-directional gaze, rather than mutual gaze, in an attempt
to simplify this perception factor and to evaluate whether onedirectional gaze is able to bias human perception of robots at
all. Although, it is possible that the non-reciprocated gaze
could also be perceived as alienating, we hypothesized that
gaze would increase grouping perception in the direction of
the gaze. This was disproved by the lack of significant difference between grouping patterns in conditions 25 and 26 in
Table 1, (appearance and behavior were neutral). Evidence
exists to show that robot gaze does not reflexively cue attention as human gaze does, which may explain why the gaze
direction didn’t have an effect on grouping (Admoni, Bank,
Tan, Toneva, & Scassellati, 2011). Further work would establish whether the considerably more influential mutual gaze
is necessary to elicit an effect on the perception of grouping.

Conclusion
In this study, we investigated the effects of behavioral mimicry, physical similarity, and eye gaze on perceptions of social groupings using precisely controllable robots. Statistically significant results showed that behavioral cues dominate
the perception of grouping, both in isolation and even with
conflicting cues of appearance and gaze. Appearance was
also found to significantly influence grouping patterns despite
conflicting behavioral cues. Non-mutual gaze was found to
be a weak factor in modulating grouping patterns.
