while such behavior is objectively irrational, it could nev-

just that the game they are perceiving may not be the
one that the experimenter intended. By directly mod-
eling the agent’s subjective state, learning and decision
making process, we are embracing McNamara’s (2013)
suggestion that researchers should consider enriching
EGT models with features such as psychological mecha-
nisms, decision making, personality variations and novel
traits, with the aim of accounting for the extensive vari-
