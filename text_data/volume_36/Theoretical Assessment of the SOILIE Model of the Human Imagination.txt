  We describe the overall theory of the SOILIE model of the
  human imagination. In this description, we outline cognitive
  capacities for learning and storage, image component
  selection and placement, as well as analogical reasoning. The
  guiding theory behind SOILIE is that visual imagination is
  constrained by regularities in visual memories.

                         Introduction
