conducted simple effects tests comparing RTs for the affect
probe with RTs for other judgment types separately within
intentional and within unintentional behaviors. Our primary
question was whether reaction times to the affective
judgment probe were slower than to other judgment probes.
We used linear mixed-effect models (LMEM) to regress
RTs on judgment type, which was dummy coded with
affective judgment (here, FEEL) as the baseline. Finally, due
to the within-subject design, each model included random
intercepts and slopes for each participant as well as a
random intercept for each scenario.
