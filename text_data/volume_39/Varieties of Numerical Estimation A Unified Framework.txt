   first graders, 40 second graders and 40 adults’ estimates using
   two fully crossed 2 × 2 designs, crossing symbol (symbolic,
   non-symbolic) and boundedness (bounded, unbounded) on
   free number-line tasks (Experiment 1) and crossing the same
   factors on anchored tasks (Experiment 2). Across all 8 tasks,
   88.84% of participants provided estimates best fit by a mixed
   log-linear model, and the weight of the logarithmic
   component (λ) decreased with age. After controlling for age,
   the λ significantly predicted arithmetic skills, whereas

   that the logarithmic-to-linear shift theory provides a unified

provides an additional reference point against which to
estimate the target number. On the other hand, Cohen and his
colleagues have claimed that the unbounded task is actually
easier because subjects need only to add incremental units,
whereas the bounded task requires subtracting from the
endpoint at the upper bound. For this reason, they suggested
that extensions of cyclic models (CPMs, see Figure 2C)
provide best fitting models for estimates in the bounded
condition and that scallop power models (SPMs, see Figure
2D) provides best fitting for estimates in the unbounded
condition (Cohen & Blanc-Goldhammer, 2011; Cohen &
Sarnecka, 2014). Though Cohen and colleagues did not
include the mixed log-linear model among the alternatives
tested, Kim and Opfer (in press) found the MLLM was a
better predictor of estimates than CPMs and SPMs for
symbolic bounded free and unbounded free number-line
tasks.

Order of tasks was determined by a balanced Latin square.

20 number-lines, with a number on each endpoint of the line.

30. On each trial, numbers were shown 2s followed by
random-noise mask. In non-symbolic conditions, procedure
was similar, except that endpoints of lines and to-be-
estimated numbers were dot arrays. Sizes of dots were
controlled on 50% of trials, while areas covered by dots were
controlled on the other 50%.
   In bounded conditions, endpoints of the line were 0 and 30
(symbolic condition) or 0 and 30 dots (non-symbolic
condition). In the unbounded condition, endpoints were 0 and
1 (symbolic condition) or 0 and 1 dot (non-symbolic
condition). The instructions for the unbounded condition
were taken from Cohen and Sarnecka (2014).
