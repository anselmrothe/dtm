Abstract
There is an ongoing debate over the psychophysical functions
that best fit human data from numerical estimation tasks. To
test whether one psychophysical function could account for
data across diverse tasks, we examined 40 kindergartners, 38
first graders, 40 second graders and 40 adults’ estimates using
two fully crossed 2 × 2 designs, crossing symbol (symbolic,
non-symbolic) and boundedness (bounded, unbounded) on
free number-line tasks (Experiment 1) and crossing the same
factors on anchored tasks (Experiment 2). Across all 8 tasks,
88.84% of participants provided estimates best fit by a mixed
log-linear model, and the weight of the logarithmic
component (λ) decreased with age. After controlling for age,
the λ significantly predicted arithmetic skills, whereas
parameters of other models failed to do so. Results suggest
that the logarithmic-to-linear shift theory provides a unified
account of numerical estimation and provides uniquely
accurate predictions for mathematical proficiency.

Introduction
In this paper, we aimed to address an ongoing debate on the
psychophysical functions that link numbers to their
magnitude estimates and to provide a unified framework for
understanding seemingly-conflicting data from a variety of
studies (Barth & Paladino, 2011; Cohen & Sarnecka, 2014;
Opfer, Thompson, & Kim, 2016; Siegler & Opfer, 2003;
Slusser, Santiago, & Barth, 2013). Specifically, we sought to
test whether models that fit data from old research methods
could accurately predict data from new methods that differed
in small increments that were thought to be psychologically
meaningful. Finally, we aimed to test whether models that
best accounted for numerical magnitude estimates also
provided the best predictors of educational outcomes.
The classic theory about developmental change in
numerical estimation is that the representation of numerical
magnitudes follows a logarithmic-to-linear shift (Siegler &
Opfer, 2003; Siegler, Thompson, & Opfer, 2009). Because
this shift occurs for different numbers at different times (e.g.,
for 0-100 number-lines before 0-1000 number-lines), this
change is thought to come from experiences that children
have in school with symbolic numbers (Siegler & Opfer,

2003). This account was originally based on a single version
of the number-line task, which is the symbolic bounded free
branch in the taxonomy in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Taxonomy of number-line tasks. Branches
connected by solid lines were examined in previous studies.
Ones connected with dashed lines are new.
Two alternative accounts were recently proposed. One is
the proportional-judgment account, claiming participants
adopt proportion judgment strategies when estimating
numerical magnitudes (Barth & Paladino, 2011; Slusser et al.,
2013). The other is the measurement-skills account, claiming
that data from number-line tasks arise from task-specific
measurement skills (Cohen & Blanc-Goldhammer, 2011;
Cohen & Sarnecka, 2014). Like the classic theory, these
accounts also depended only on specific sets of number-line
tasks (symbolic bounded anchored for proportional-judgment
account; symbolic unbounded free for measurement-skills
account (see Figure 1).

1. Symbolic vs. Non-symbolic
One potentially important variable is whether numerical
magnitudes are presented symbolically or non-symbolically.
For the log-to-linear shift account, this variable is important
because symbolic numbers are presented to children in
number-lines in school, on rulers, and in arithmetic lessons.
Most studies have focused only on the symbolic magnitude
estimates, though with different psychophysical functions
being proposed (Barth & Paladino, 2011; Cohen & Sarnecka,

2943

2014; Opfer et al., 2016; Siegler & Opfer, 2003; Slusser et
al., 2013).
In contrast, when Dehaene et al. (2008) presented Amazon
indigene with non-symbolic numeric magnitudes, they found
that a mixed log-linear model (MLLM, see Figure 2A)
provided a better fit to number-line estimates than
alternatives. Among these alternatives, however, the power
models proposed by Slusser et al. (2013) and Cohen & BlancGoldhammer (2011) were not included.

2. Bounded vs. Unbounded
Another potentially important feature of number-line
estimation is whether an upper endpoint is provided
(bounded) or not (unbounded). Like symbols, the use of a
numeric upper bound may make the task easier because it
provides an additional reference point against which to
estimate the target number. On the other hand, Cohen and his
colleagues have claimed that the unbounded task is actually
easier because subjects need only to add incremental units,
whereas the bounded task requires subtracting from the
endpoint at the upper bound. For this reason, they suggested
that extensions of cyclic models (CPMs, see Figure 2C)
provide best fitting models for estimates in the bounded
condition and that scallop power models (SPMs, see Figure
2D) provides best fitting for estimates in the unbounded
condition (Cohen & Blanc-Goldhammer, 2011; Cohen &
Sarnecka, 2014). Though Cohen and colleagues did not
include the mixed log-linear model among the alternatives
tested, Kim and Opfer (in press) found the MLLM was a
better predictor of estimates than CPMs and SPMs for
symbolic bounded free and unbounded free number-line
tasks.

with symbolic bounded free (SBF), symbolic unbounded free
(SUF), non-symbolic bounded free (NBF), non-symbolic
unbounded free (NUF) tasks in Experiment 1 and symbolic
bounded anchored (SBA), symbolic unbounded anchored
(SUA), non-symbolic bounded anchored (NBA), nonsymbolic unbounded anchored (NUA) tasks in Experiment 2.
At the end of Experiment 2, we also administrated a battery
of math tests, including addition and subtraction, to each
subject to determine which model parameters best predicted
addition and subtraction proficiency. This issue has
educational significance, but it also tests the key cognitive
process claim of the measurement-skills account, viz. that
unbounded number-line estimates are easier than the bounded
ones because they require addition skills rather than
subtraction skills.

3. Free vs. Anchored
A third potentially important variable is whether subjects are
given the numeric magnitude of the half-way point on the
number-line (anchored) or not (free). Like the use of an upper
bound, Opfer et al. (2016) have argued that the anchored task
provides an additional reference point that should increase
linearity of estimates. On the other hand, Slusser et al. (2013)
have argued that the task reveals changes in proportional
reasoning, and they showed that children's symbolic bounded
anchored number-line estimates were better fit by one of
three adapted cyclical power models (CPMs) (Hollands &
Dyre, 2000) than a simple logarithmic model. Subsequent
studies, however, found the MLLM provided a better fit to
both symbolic bounded free and symbolic bounded anchored
number-line estimates than mixtures of the CPMs (Opfer et
al., 2016), which was called MCPM1 (see Figure 2B) in Kim
and Opfer (in press)’s study.

condition (C) and the mixed scallop power model for

Experiment 1: Free Numerical Estimation
Methods
Participants Participants were 40 kindergartners (M=5.98
years; 47.5% female), 38 first-graders (M=7.13 years; 50%
female), 40 second-graders (M=8.09 years; 57.5% female)
and 40 adults (M=20.1 years; 50% female).
Materials and procedure Participants were administered
four different number-line tasks using a 2 (symbolic/non-

The Current Study
In this study, we manipulated all three variables orthogonally
to systematically test the mixed log-linear model against its
competitors on 4 previously examined tasks and 4 novel
tasks. Thus, we tested all the branches shown in Figure 1,

2944

symbolic) by 2 (bounded/unbounded) fully-crossed design
Order of tasks was determined by a balanced Latin square.
In symbolic conditions, participants were presented with
20 number-lines, with a number on each endpoint of the line.
The to-be-estimated numerals were evenly sampled from 0 to
30. On each trial, numbers were shown 2s followed by
random-noise mask. In non-symbolic conditions, procedure
was similar, except that endpoints of lines and to-beestimated numbers were dot arrays. Sizes of dots were
controlled on 50% of trials, while areas covered by dots were
controlled on the other 50%.
In bounded conditions, endpoints of the line were 0 and 30
(symbolic condition) or 0 and 30 dots (non-symbolic
condition). In the unbounded condition, endpoints were 0 and
1 (symbolic condition) or 0 and 1 dot (non-symbolic
condition). The instructions for the unbounded condition
were taken from Cohen and Sarnecka (2014).

Results
1.
Logarithmic-to-linear-shift
theory
accurately
predicted median estimates and individual differences.
We first fit median estimates for all four number-line tasks
and age groups using MLLM. Across all tasks and age groups
(Figure 3), fit of MLLM was very high (R2 =.93 ~ 1).
Analyses of the weight of logarithmic component (λ) revealed
that with age, estimates changed from logarithmic patterns to
linear ones, with λ decreasing from kindergartners to adults
across all tasks (Figure 3). As expected, λ in non-symbolic
conditions was higher than in symbolic ones. Also, λ in
unbounded conditions was higher than in bounded ones
regardless of symbolic format, which argues against the view
that “the unbounded task requires less mathematical
sophistication than the bounded task does” (Cohen and
Sarnecka, 2014). To test whether individual performance
revealed the same pattern, we computed λ for individual
participants’ data and conducted a mixed ANOVA, with
symbolic format and boundedness as within-participant
factors and age group as a between-participant factor. Results
showed a main effect of symbolic format, F(1,154)=74.19,
p<.001, boundedness, F(1,154)=86.32, p<.001, and age
group, F(3,154)=39.08, p<.001. An interaction between
symbolic format and boundedness, F(1,154)=4.17, p<.05,
indicated that the effect of symbols was greater for the
bounded tasks.
To test whether logarithmicity of estimates represented a
stable pattern of individual differences, we correlated
individual participants’ λ among all tasks. Results showed
that individual participant’s λ among all the four number line
tasks positively correlated (with correlation coefficient .70
(p<.001) between SBF and SUF tasks; .45 (p<.001) between
SBF and NBF tasks; .35 (p<.001) between SBF and NUF
tasks; .49 (p<.001) between SUF and NBF tasks; .39 between
SUF and NUF tasks; and .54 (p<.001) between NBF and
NUF tasks).

2. Model comparison. We next compared the fit of MLLM
to that of its competitors: MLLM vs MCPM1 and MCPM2
for the bounded conditions and MLLM vs MSPM for the

2945

unbounded ones. The proportion of individual children who
were best fit by the mixed log-linear model (MLLM) using
AICc was calculated.
As illustrated in Table 1, estimates of 68% to 100% of
participants were best fit by mixed log-linear model (MLLM)
among all four free number line tasks. In the bounded
condition, none of the MCPMs was the best fitting model for
the majority of any age or task combination. In unbounded
condition, we replicated the findings from Kim and Opfer (in
press), with MLLM providing a better fit for 100% of
participants’ estimates compared to MSPM.
3. Predicting the mathematical performance. We next
conducted partial correlation analysis between individual
participant’s addition and subtraction performance (which
were tested in Experiment 2) and the best-fitting parameter
values from the models when controlling for age. The
addition score was the sum score of simple and complex
addition problems, and the subtraction score was the sum
score of simple and complex subtraction problems.
As shown in Table 2, the logarithmicity parameter λ of the
MLLM predicted both addition and subtraction performance
across all tasks after controlling for age. In contrast, the
correlations among the model parameters of the MLLM
competitors were very small, inconsistent, and not expected
by the theories that generated the models. Specifically, for
bounded conditions, the negative correlation between the
absolute value of bs-1 of the MCPMs and math performance
was found in only a few of number line tasks, with the
absolute value of b2CPM-1 of MCPM1 negatively correlating
with addition for the symbolic bounded free number line task
(r(156)=-.18, p<.05), the absolute value of bSBCM-1 of
MCPM2 negatively correlating with addition and subtraction
for the non-symbolic bounded free task (r(156)=-.17, p<.05
for addition; r(156)=-.17, p<.05 for subtraction). Also, only
the absolute value of s-1 in MCPM2 negatively correlating
with subtraction was found in symbolic bounded free task
(r(156)=-.17, p<.05). For the unbounded condition, the
negative correlation between the absolute value of bMSPM-1 in
MSPM and addition was only found in symbolic unbounded
free task (r(156)=-.18, p<.05). These finding suggests that
MLLM uniquely predicts math performance, regardless of
tasks or age groups.

Experiment 2: Anchored Numerical
Estimation
Methods
Participants Participants in Experiment 2 were the same as
in Experiment 1.
Materials and procedure Participants received the same 2
(symbolic/non-symbolic) by 2 (bounded/unbounded) number
line tasks as in Experiment 1, except that information was
given about the location of 15 (or 15 dots) in each of the four
tasks. Order of tasks followed a Latin square. After that, 200
arithmetic problems were presented for participants to solve
as quickly as possible: simple addition, simple subtraction,
complex addition and complex subtraction. For simple

addition problems, each of the addends was a one-digit
number and the sum was no more than 10 (e.g., 5+3, 2+1).
For simple subtraction problems, the difference was less than
10 and both minuend and subtrahend were one-digit numbers
(e.g., 9-3, 8-2). For complex addition problems, sums were
bigger than 10 but less than 30, and addends were one- or
two-digit numbers (e.g., 4+16, 14+15). For complex
subtraction problems, differences were bigger than 10 but
less than 30, with the minuend a two-digit number and the
subtrahend one- or two-digit numbers (e.g., 16-5, 25-11).

Results
1.
Logarithmic-to-linear-shift
theory
accurately
predicted median estimates and individual differences.
We first fit the median estimates for all four number line tasks
and age groups using MLLM. As shown in Figure 4, across
all tasks and age groups, the fit of MLLM was uniformly high
(R2 = .93 ~ 1). Analyses of λ revealed that with age, estimates
changed from logarithmic patterns to linear ones, with λ
decreasing from kindergartners to adults (Figure 4). As with
Experiment 1, λ in non-symbolic conditions were higher than
in symbolic ones, and λ in unbounded conditions were higher
than in bounded conditions regardless of symbol. We also
computed λ for individual participants’ data. The mixed
ANOVA results again showed a main effect of symbolic
format,
F(1,154)=83.17,
p<.001,
boundedness,
F(1,154)=21.20, p<.001, and age group, F(3,154) =19.63,
p<.001.
To test whether the logarithmic-to-linear-shift theory could
also capture individual differences, we correlated individual
participant’s λ among tasks. The results showed that
individual participant’s λ among all the four number line
tasks positively correlated (with correlation coefficient .81
(p<.001) between SBA and SUA tasks; .61 (p<.001) between
SBA and NBA tasks; .48 (p<.001) between SBA and NUA
tasks; .54 (p<.001) between SUA and NBA tasks; .43
(p<.001) between SUA and NUA tasks; and .61 (p<.001)
between NBA and NUA tasks.
2. Model comparison. We next examined whether MLLM is
the best model compared to other competitors. According to
the previous studies (Cohen & Sarnecka, 2014; Opfer et al.,
2016; Slusser et al., 2013), we compared the fit of MLLM,
MCPM1, and MCPM2 on individual data for the bounded
condition (which included SBA and NBA tasks). Since the
unbounded anchored number-line tasks were new in this
study, we compared the fit of all the four models for the
unbounded condition (which included SUA and NUA tasks).
The proportion of individual children who were best fit by the
mixed log-linear model (MLLM) using AICc was calculated.
As illustrated in Table 3, the estimates of 63% to 100% of
participants were best fit by mixed log-linear model (MLLM)
among all four anchored tasks across all age groups.
Specifically, in the bounded condition, no matter what types
of symbol were given, against to the proportional account and
subtraction or division-skill account, none of the MCPMs
was the best fitting model for the majority. In the unbounded
condition, our results showed that estimates of 65% to 98%

2946

between individual participants’ addition and subtraction
performance and the best-fitting parameter values from the
models when controlling for age. As shown in Table 4, λ in
the MLLM predicted both addition and subtraction
performance across almost all the anchored number line tasks
after controlling for age. However, for bounded condition, the
negative correlation between the absolute value of bs-1 of the
MCPMs and math performance was only found for the
symbolic bounded anchored task, with absolute value of
b2CPM-1 in MCPM2 negatively correlating with addition and
subtraction (r(156)=-.26, p<.001 for addition; r(156)=-.26,
p<.001 for subtraction). The finding suggests that MLLM
uniquely predict math performance, regardless of tasks or age
groups.

of participants were best fitting by MLLM when compared
the fitting of all the four models. All these results suggest the
logarithmic-to-linear-shift account for all the anchored
numerical magnitude representation, regardless of
boundedness or symbolic format.
3. Predicting the mathematical performance. Similar with
Experiment 1, we also conducted partial correlation analysis

Our experiments indicate that the logarithmic-to-linear shift
account provides a unified framework that can account for
data coming from a broad array of numerical estimation
tasks. Specifically, we found a mixed log-linear model was
the best fitting model for the vast majority (88.84%) of
children and adults. This finding held regardless of whether
the symbolic format was symbolic or non-symbolic, whether
the task was bounded or unbounded, and whether an
additional reference was given or not. These results replicate
those reported in Opfer et al. (2016) and Kim and Opfer (in
press), as well as extending them to 4 novel number-line
tasks. Finally, we found that with education, individuals
acquire more substantial prior experience with symbolic
numbers than non-symbolic dots, with more logarithmic
compression shown in non-symbolic than symbolic
condition. Also, the additional reference points (either
midpoints or bounded endpoints) can increase the linearity of
estimates. Thus, the classic number line task (SBF) is not an
outlier in eliciting logarithmic pattern of estimates. Of the
eight tasks, the highest logarithmicity was observed in
kindergartners’ estimating non-symbolic unbounded free
(NBF) task and the lowest was in SBA.
Our results also showed that the logarithmic weight (λ) was
not fixed, but depended on the developmental history and
prior experiences of the subject, leading to lower λ values
from kindergartners to adults. These findings met the
overarching principle of the logarithmic-to-linear shift
theory, which holds that the representation of numerical
magnitude will change from the logarithmic pattern to linear
one with age and experience (Opfer et al., 2011; Opfer &
Siegler, 2007; Siegler & Booth, 2004; Siegler & Opfer, 2003;
Thompson & Opfer, 2008).
Finally, individual differences were stable across the eight
tasks: children whose estimates were more logarithmic in one
task were also more logarithmic in the other seven tasks,
r(156)=.35 ~ .81, p<.001. This would not be expected if the
eight tasks elicited radically different estimation strategies,
and it suggests that the logarithmic-to-linear theory provides
an accurate picture for mental representation of all kinds of
numerical estimations.

Implications for alternative accounts
Broadly, our results undercut key claims of the proportionjudgment and measurement-skills accounts. A key claim of
the proportion-judgment account is that developmental
change involves a change in the degree of bias and use of
implicit reference points. In this view, the degree of bias (β)
was thought to gradually converge on 1, and more reference
points would be utilized by the participants, “from an
unbounded power to a one-cycle proportional to a two-cycle
proportional version of the model” (Slusser et al., 2013, p.5).
If these views were correct, the weights for 0-cyclic power
model (w1) and 1-cyclic power model (w2) in MCPM1 would
be expected to decrease with age and the weight for 2-cyclic
power model (w3) would be expected to increase –at the very
least among the bounded tasks in Experiment 1 and 2.
However, we found no support for this developmental pattern
among any of our eight tasks. Additionally, there was no
stable pattern of individual differences in the degree of bias
and use of reference points. Given the relatively poor fits of
these models, this lack of predictive power might not be
surprising, but it does warrant caution about the
psychological meaning of the parameter values.
Our results also provide robust evidence against the
measurements-skills account. First, according to Cohen and
Sarnecka (2014), “the implicit addition needed for the
unbounded task is less mathematically sophisticated than the
implicit subtraction needed for the bounded task, [therefore]
children should perform better on the unbounded task at a
younger age” (p. 1643). Against this contention, we found
greater accuracy for bounded than unbounded tasks
regardless of age, symbolic format, or provision of anchors.
Far from being easier, the unbounded tasks were more
difficult and actually yielded the highest logarithmicity
scores. Even more critically, the parameter values of the
models associated with this account (subtraction and scallop
bias) were thought to track general subtraction and addition
skill. If so, one would expect them to predict subtraction and
addition skill when subjects actually performed subtraction
and addition. However, we found no evidence that this was
the case. Again, given the relatively poor fits of these models,
its lack of predictive power should not be surprising.
