Abstract
Biased attention is assumed to play an important role in the
etiology and maintenance of depression and depressive
symptoms. In this paper, we used data from a categorization
task and an associated model to assess the attentional bias of
people with varying levels of depressive symptoms.
Attentional bias was operationalized as the parameter estimate
in a prototype model of categorization. For estimation, we used
a Bayesian hierarchical mixture approach. We expected to find
a positive correlation between depressive symptoms and an AB
for negative material and a negative correlation between
depressive symptoms and a bias toward positive material.
Despite good model fit, Bayesian regression analyses revealed
weak or moderate evidence in favor of the null model assuming
no association between attentional preferences and depressive
symptoms, both for negative and positive material.

Introduction
Biased attention takes an important position in cognitive
theories explaining the etiology and maintenance of
psychological disorders. In particular, depression has been
theorized to be linked to biased attention for negative
information (Beck, 1976). Multiple methods have been
developed to assess attentional biases (AB). The most
popular approaches include reaction time assessments, in
which response latencies for negative, positive, and neutral
material are compared, and translated into AB indices. Eye
tracking techniques, comparing fixation durations on
negative, positive, and neutral stimuli, are also a popular
approach. Caution is recommended however, in both
approaches. When relying on reaction time assessments, one
has to consider the ambiguity and lack of reliability often
associated with response latencies (Rodebaugh et al., 2016).
Eye tracking techniques appear to yield good reliability
estimates, but only if certain conditions are met (Rodebaugh

et al., 2016). Moreover, as these techniques focus exclusively
on overt attentional processes, they are less informative with
regard to attentional resources that are allocated covertly,
without saccadic eye movements. Perhaps not surprisingly,
results obtained with these existing approaches are not
consistent (Peckham, McHugh, & Otto, 2010).
The goal of this paper is to explore novel methodologies
for assessing attentional biases associated with depressive
symptoms. In particular, inspired by Viken, Treat, Nosofsky,
McFall, and Palmeri (2002), we tested the applicability of a
categorization approach to assess AB’s in the context of
depression (see also Kruschke & Vanpaemel, 2015).
Participants were presented pictures of human faces varying
in emotional expression (emotional stimulus dimension) and
hair color (neutral stimulus dimension). They were asked to
classify these stimuli in two different categories, each
represented by a prototype stimulus of that category. The two
prototypes reflected extreme levels of the stimulus
dimensions and were each other’s opposites. For example,
prototype A had a light hair color, and a very sad facial
expression, versus prototype B with a dark hair color and a
slightly sad facial expression. In this way, participants could
either choose to focus on the hair color (or neutral) dimension
or on the facial expression (or emotional) dimension to
classify the pictures. These data, taking the form of
classification counts of each category, per stimulus, were
then used to estimate participant-specific parameters in a
prototype model (e.g., Nosofsky, 1987). One of these
parameters corresponds to the attentional weight (AW) for
one stimulus dimension, reflecting the relative attentional
preference for that stimulus dimensions compared to the
other stimulus dimension.
We expected to find a positive correlation between
depressive symptoms and an AB for negative material and a
negative correlation between depressive symptoms and a bias
toward positive material (Peckham et al., 2010). In addition

3022

to depressive symptoms, we assessed anxiety symptoms, as
depression and anxiety are known for their comorbidity, and
our aim was to isolate the relation of AB to depressive
symptoms. Brooding or depressive rumination, and a
negative mood, were also investigated in this study, since
both variables have already been related to an attentional bias
for negative material (Bradley, Mogg, & Lee, 1997; Koster,
De Lissnyder, Derakshan, & De Raedt, 2011). Finally, the
personality trait, neuroticism was assessed, in order to
explore whether this important risk factor for depression,
could be related to an AB for negative information.

Method
Every participant received two versions of a classification
task, each version was administered in two (withinparticipant) conditions. In all versions and conditions,
participants were asked to classify facial stimuli according to
two prototype stimuli. The stimuli were made up of only two
different stimulus dimensions: brightness of hair color and
intensity of emotional expression. In the happy condition, the
emotional expression ranged from a slightly to a very happy
facial expression, whereas in the sad condition, it ranged from
slightly to very sad.
We report all data exclusions, all included questionnaires
or measures, and all study conditions.

Participants
A total of 309 first-year psychology students participated in
this study in exchange for course credits (262 women, mean
age = 18.53, SD = 1.90, with a range from 17 to 39). The
sample size was determined by the number of participants
showing up during the two weeks of data collection, available
for all first-year students of the Psychology department of the
University of Leuven (Belgium).

Öhman, 1998). Applying Fotomorph 13.9 (Softland SRL)
and GIMP (2008), the pictures were adjusted in such way
they only systematically differed from each other on two
dimensions: The intensity of facial expression and the
brightness of the hair color. On the basis of the modified
stimuli, a negative and positive stimulus set were created. In
the sad condition, the intensity of the facial expression ranged
between very sad and slightly sad, whereas in the happy
condition, the intensity ranged from very happy to slightly
happy. By creating five different levels of emotional
expression (mild intensity – strong intensity) and five
different levels of brightness of hair color (light – dark) and
combining all possible levels, we obtained a stimulus set
consisting of 25 different pictures for each condition.
Prototypes were extreme on both dimensions (for example, a
stimulus having a very sad emotional expression of level 5,
and very dark hair color of level 5). Figure 1 presents
example stimuli.
Task In both conditions, participants were asked to classify
all pictures of the condition-specific stimulus sets into
category A or B. Category A was represented by one of the
four prototypes, and category B by the inverse prototype,
within the same emotional condition. For example, in the sad
condition, if prototype A had level 5 of sadness (very sad)
and level 5 of hair color (very dark), then prototype B had
level 1 of sadness (slightly sad), and level 1 of hair color (very
light). The prototypes stayed on participants’ computer
screen during the entire task. In each trial, participants had to
classify one picture into one of the two categories. No
feedback was provided, so participants could freely choose
how to classify the stimuli. In making the classification
decisions, participants thus could either base their
classifications on the pictures’ hair color or facial expression,
reflecting their attentional focus on these dimensions.

Materials
Self-report Measures The Center for Epidemiologic Studies
- Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) was used to
assess depressive symptoms (score: 0 - 60). The Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Spinhoven et al.,
1997), was included to assess comorbid depression (score: 0
- 21) and anxiety symptoms (score: 0 - 21). We also included
the Rumination Response Scale (RRS; Nolen-Hoeksema, &
Morrow, 1991) to assess brooding (score: 5 - 20), and the Ten
Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; Gosling, Rentfrow, Swann,
2003) to assess neuroticism (score: 1 - 7). Finally, the current
mood of participants was measured with a 5-point Likert
scale (“How do you feel at this moment? 1 (very unhappy) 2 (slightly unhappy) - 3 (neutral) - 4 (slightly happy) - 5 (very
happy”). Dutch versions of these questionnaires were
administered.
Stimuli The stimuli were adopted from the Karolinska
Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF; Lundqvist, Flykt, &

For each condition, there were two versions of the task,
differing in the prototype pairs used. Version 1 consisted of
prototype A1, with level 5 of sadness, and level 5 of hair
color, and prototype B1, with level 1 of sadness, and level 1
of hair color. Version 2 consisted of prototype A2 with level
1 of sadness, and level 5 of hair color, and prototype B2 with
level 5 of sadness and level 1 of hair color.

Procedure
Each participant ran through both conditions, and in each
condition, they performed two versions of the same task. The
order of the conditions, and task versions within the
conditions, was counterbalanced between participants.
In each task, participants categorized two blocks in which
all 23 non-prototype stimuli were presented in a random
order. Thus, within each task version, each stimulus was
classified twice. After completing the categorization tasks,
participants were asked to indicate their current mood state,
and to fill out the CES-D, HADS, RRS, and TIPI.

Model
The categorization data were analyzed using Nosofsky’s
(1987) weighted prototype classification model:
P(A│i) =

ηiA
ηiA +ηiB

The model assumes that the probability of classifying
stimulus i in category A, P(A│i), is driven by the perceived
similarity between stimulus i and prototype A, 𝜂𝑖𝐴 , divided
by the overall perceived similarity between stimulus i and
prototype A and prototype B. The perceived similarity
between stimulus i and prototype A is assumed to be an
exponential decay function determined by a sensitivity
parameter c, and the weighted distance between the stimulus
and the prototype, 𝑑𝑖𝐴 :

point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (light hair color/mild facial
expression) to 9 (dark hair color/ intense facial expression).
For both the sad and happy conditions, the split-half
reliabilities of respectively the affect and hair color
dimensions were .96 and .99. The coordinates of the stimuli
were calculated by taking the mean rating on each dimension
for every stimulus.
The prototype model was extended hierarchically and with
a mixture component in a Bayesian framework (see e.g.,
Bartlema, Lee, Wetzels, & Vanpaemel, 2014). The
hierarchical extension was used to accommodate continuous,
qualitative individual differences, and to shrink extreme
values, whereas the mixture component was included to
accommodate discrete, quantitative individual differences. In
particular, it allowed differentiating between three groups of
participants: The first group consists of people whose
behavior was captured better by a guessing model, which
assumed that the response probability for each stimulus was
.5. Identifying these participants avoids contamination of our
parameter estimates by participants for whom the prototype
model was not sufficiently appropriate, that is, participants
who appeared to be guessing (see, e.g., Voorspoels, Rutten,
Bartlema, Tuerlinckx & Vanpaemel, in press, and Zeigenfuse
& Lee, 2010 for a similar approach).
Among the participants assigned to the prototype group,
we allowed two subgroups: the ‘affect group’ and the
‘neutral/hair group’ with the ‘affect group’ having a higher
group-level AW for the affect dimension, as compared to the
‘hair group’. In particular, we restricted the mean AW for the
affect dimension in the ‘affect group’ to be higher than the
mean AW for affect in the ‘hair group’.

Results
Model Analyses

𝜂𝑖𝐴 = 𝑒 −𝑐𝑑𝑖𝐴
The sensitivity parameter c reflects how clearly the stimuli
could be discriminated from each other. The weighted
distance between the stimuli and prototype A, 𝑑𝑖𝐴 , was
computed as follows:
𝑑𝑖𝐴 = 𝑤𝑎 │𝑥𝑖𝑎 − 𝑥𝐴𝑎 │ + (1 − 𝑤𝑎 )│𝑥𝑖ℎ − 𝑥𝐴ℎ │
where 𝑥𝑖𝑎 represents the coordinate of stimulus i on
dimension affect, and 𝑥𝑖ℎ the coordinate of stimulus i on
dimension hair, in psychological space. 𝑥𝐴𝑎 is the coordinate
of prototype A on dimension affect, and 𝑥𝐴ℎ the coordinate of
prototype A on dimension hair. 𝑤𝑎 is the AW for the affect
dimension, and 1 - 𝑤𝑎 is the AW for the hair dimension.
The coordinates of the stimuli and prototypes were
obtained in a separate study in which a different group of 32
participants rated the two dimensions of all stimuli on a 10-

The model was implemented in JAGS (Plummer, 2011). We
ran 3 chains with 36 000 iterations each, after discarding 4000
iterations for burn in. We performed separate analyses for the
sad and happy conditions. The data from the two task
versions (different prototypes) within each condition were
jointly modelled in order to obtain a single AW in each
condition. The model analyses identified two clearly
distinguishable groups (a group focusing on affect and a
group focusing on hair color) in both conditions.
In the sad condition, the ‘affect group’ contained 141
participants, whose AW was larger for the affect dimension
(the group-level posterior had a mean w_sadness = .88),
compared to the ‘neutral/hair group’, containing 163
participants (mean w_sadness = .21).
In the happy condition, the ‘affect group’ contained (again)
141 participants, whose AW was larger for the affect
dimension (the group-level mean attention to happiness was:
w_happiness = .87), compared to the ‘neutral/hair group’
(mean w_happiness = .19), consisting of 167 participants.

Also, a number of participants were not distinguishable from
guessers. In the sad condition, we identified five guessers,
with one of them being also, the only, guesser in the happy
condition.
To evaluate the fit of the model, we inspected the grouplevel posterior predictive for all categorization tasks. To give
an idea of how well the model performs, Figure 2 presents
the posterior predictive for one of the two task versions in the
sad condition. Each panel shows a schematic representation
of the stimulus space (five by five stimuli, represented by the
squares), with the corner stimuli being prototypes. The panels
depict the latent groups. In each square, the background color
provides an indication of the model’s posterior prediction for
the corresponding stimulus and group, as a gradient between
the top left prototype (orange) and lower right prototype
(blue). The stronger the color matches the prototype, the more
firmly the model predicts classification in the corresponding
category. In each square, the circle color is an indication of
the average observed classification count of the
corresponding stimulus, across all participants in the group.
Thus, matching colors between background and circle
provide insight in the match between the model’s posterior
predictions and the observed data.

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that the model successfully
captures the patterns within each latent group. Also, the
predicted and observed stimulus groupings are sensible
considering the AWs applied in each group, with the affect
group categorizing the stimuli according to the affect
dimension, and the hair group according to the hair color
dimension.

Regression Analyses
After excluding five participants who were assigned to the
guessing group, multiple regression analyses were performed
to investigate the relationship between attentional
preferences, as operationalized by the individual-level
estimates of 𝑤𝑎 , and
depressive symptoms, anxiety
symptoms, brooding, neuroticism, and current mood. All
variables showed sufficient variability (see Table 1 for the
descriptive statistics). Variance inflation factors (VIF; Hair,
Anderson, Tatham, Black, 1995) indicated only a low degree
of multicollinearity in our model (largest VIF was 3.22, well
below the threshold of 10).

The regression analyses were performed using the
BayesFactor package (Morey & Rouder, 2013). A BF
compares the evidence for the null model with the evidence
for the alternative model. Given the null model in the
numerator, a BF > 1 indicates evidence in favor of the null
model, whereas a BF < 1 indicates evidence in favor of the
alternative model.
To test the effect of each predictor (e.g., depressive
symptoms), we compared a restricted model containing all
predictors, except for the predictor of interest (null model),
against a full model containing all predictors (alternative
model). As a sensitivity analysis, both medium and ultrawide
scale factors were used to calculate the Bayes factors. As can
be seen in Table 2, the Bayes factors showed evidence in
favor of the null model for all predictors in both conditions
(with the exception of current mood in the sad condition
when a medium scale factor was used). The strength of the
evidence depends on the exact choice of scale factor. When
the scale factor is medium, the evidence in favor of the null

3025

model is weak, and thus these results are best interpreted as
being inconclusive. With increasing scale factor, the
evidence in favor of the null grows stronger, but it is never
very strong. Overall, these analyses suggest that no strong
evidence for meaningful associations could be found between
the symptom and traits scores and the AWs. The near zero
partial correlation coefficients (using the ppcor package;
Seongho, 2015), confirm this picture, as can be found in
Table 2.

solve the elusiveness of attentional biases in the context of
depression. First, attentional preferences were extracted from
a model, that excluded people whose behavior could better be
predicted by a guessing model, instead of the prototype
model. This means that data resulting from random behavior
were filtered out. Second, by considering a specific parameter
in a model to conceptualize attentional biases, other processes
that might influence participants’ behavior in the task, such
as people’s discrimination abilities (c parameter), were
factored out. Third, assessing attentional processes by
considering their impact on categorization behavior could be
quite insightful, given that classification decisions reflect the
way in which people organize and structure their world.
Attentional bias indices obtained by analyzing categorization
behavior can give us an idea about how strongly attentional
preferences influence the way in which people perceive and
organize their environment.

Discussion
Applying a categorization approach to the assessment of
attentional biases in people with varying levels of depressive
symptoms revealed weak to moderate evidence for the
absence of an association between severity of depressive
symptoms and an attentional bias to sadness or happiness.
Similar BFs were observed for the other predictors of interest:
anxiety symptoms, brooding, neuroticism, and current mood.
In the light of the small Bayes factors, especially when using
a medium scale factor, we cannot make strong statements
about rejecting the alternative model, or accepting the null
model.
These findings are in line with previous inconsistencies in
results obtained with the frequentist approaches investigating
attentional biases in the context of depression (Peckham et
al., 2010). In some studies p values above .05, whereas in
other studies, p values below .05 were found, without a clear
explanation as to when to expect significant results and when
not.
An important limitation of the current study that could
explain the results, is the recruited sample. A high
functioning student sample was recruited. Though we could
observe a reasonable amount of variability in depression
scores, the sample may have been too healthy to detect
attentional biases related to depressive symptomatology. A
next step is to apply this approach to data obtained in a sample
of more severely depressed participants.
We believe the modelling approach demonstrated here, has
a number of advantages that might prove useful in helping to
