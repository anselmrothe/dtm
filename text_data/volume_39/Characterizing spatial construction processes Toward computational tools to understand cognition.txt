construction strategies may be related to perceptual or
semantic groupings of the blocks within the structure. The
sub-parts which the builder chooses to construct, and the
order in which they are created may be driven by the
builder’s perceptual parsing of the model being copied.
More generally, there may be systematic commonalities in
the construction paths that builders use, and these may vary
depending on the builder’s level of skill.
