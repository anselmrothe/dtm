may otherwise get trapped in local optima. With this in mind,
adults may have more difficulty discovering unusual causal
relationships because their search is too focused and too close
to their initial guesses to accommodate distant ideas.
   The purpose of our current studies is to test the hypothesis
that belief updating in adults is exploitation-biased. To ac-
complish this, we designed a task encouraging participants to
generate a particular initial hypothesis about a novel causal
relationship. Evidence that contradicted this hypothesis was
then presented, causing participants to modify their beliefs.
