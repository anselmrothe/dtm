examined in Experiment 1.
  Consistent with the maximum cross-correlation results
above, when the artificial agent slave system was coupled to
the live human actor master system in Experiment 2, most
combinations of feedback delays and coupling strengths
were associated with the artificial agent lagging behind the
human actor (see Fig. 3). There was in fact relatively more
anticipation than lagging at the longest feedback delay in
Experiment 2 (i.e., 399.90 ms), but the overall stability the
phase relationships at this delay was reduced in comparison
to the shorter delays. It is important to keep in mind that
both the IRP frequency distributions and the maximum
cross-correlation analysis represent average phase and
temporal relationships between the artificial agent and the
master system to which it is coupled. Furthermore, a
participant-wise examination revealed that the artificial
agent achieved anticipation for three of the eight
participants in the 1.5 coupling strength condition, and five
of the nine participants in the 2.0 coupling strength
condition. This provides strong support for the idea that the
kind of artificial agent developed and tested here can
produce adaptive, prospectively coordinated behavior              Figure 3: Distribution of average instantaneous relative
