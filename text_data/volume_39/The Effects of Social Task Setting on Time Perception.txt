Statistical Analysis
Collected data was analyzed in three different sections: Time
Reproduction, the Simon Task and the Questionnaire. For the
time reproduction, 3x3 mixed ANOVAs with social task
setting (individual, cooperative, competitive) as a between-
subjects variable and duration (short, medium, long) as a
within-subjects variable were conducted on three dependent
measures: Duration Ratio (Reproduced Duration/Objective
Duration), Absolute Error/Actual Duration and Coefficient of           Figure 1: Mean Ratio of Reproduced/Objective Duration

The Simon Task
The analysis of the Simon task revealed that congruency had
a significant effect (F(1,87)=101.03, p<.001, ηp2=.54).
Response times were significantly shorter in the congruent
condition (M=525.66, SE=2.77) in comparison to the
incongruent condition (M=533.21, SE=2.79) (see Figure 3).
This difference amounts to the “Simon effect”. Task setting
