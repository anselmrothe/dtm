tional probabilities of two states, rather than representing the
entire joint distribution. That calculating conditional prob-
abilities only requires consideration of the node’s Markov
blanket further aids efficiency (Koller & Friedman, 2009).
    The model thus far is simply an efficient MH model for es-
timating a causal graph’s joint distribution. Importantly, how-
ever, we introduce a bias in the starting point for sampling: It
