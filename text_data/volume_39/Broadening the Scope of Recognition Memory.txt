Pre-Experimental Recognition Results from the pre-
experimental recognition task are presented in Figure 2.
From visual inspection of Figure 2, two patterns are
apparent. First, the probability of judging city names as
recognized from outside the laboratory increased as a
function of environmental frequency. Second, the
probability that participants judged city names as
recognized from outside the laboratory was slightly higher
for studied city names than for unstudied city names.
Additionally, it appears that the influence of a study
exposure was relatively consistent across varying degrees of
environmental frequency. To test the influence of both
factors (study status and environmental frequency), a
multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted to fit
pre-experimental recognition judgements using study status
and environmental frequency as predictors. A test of the
