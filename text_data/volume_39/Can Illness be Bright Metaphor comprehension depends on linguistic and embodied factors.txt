Abstract
Conceptual representations in language processing employ
both linguistic distributional and embodied information. Here,
we aim to demonstrate the roles of these two components in
metaphor processing. The linguistic component is captured by
linguistic distributional frequency (LDF), that is, how often
the constituent words appear together in context. The
embodied component, on the other hand, refers to how easy it
is to generate an embodied simulation, operationalised by a
previous norming study. In the current study, we looked at the
interplay of these components in metaphor processing, and
investigated their roles at different depths of processing in
two experiments. Thus, we required participants to engage in
shallow processing (Experiment 1: Sensibility Judgement), or
deep processing (Experiment 2: Interpretation Generation).
Results showed that the increase of both variables made it
more likely to accept a metaphor. However, whereas ease of
simulation (EoS) contributed to the speed of processing at
both levels of depth, LDF only affected the speed in shallow
processing. Specifically, LDF acted as a heuristic, both to
speed up responses to accept metaphors as sensible when the
frequency is high, and to flag up potentially unsuccessful
processing when it is low. Overall, these results support views
of language processing that emphasise the importance of both
linguistic and embodied components according to task goals.

Traditional views of metaphor processing
In a metaphoric expression, a word or a phrase (the source)
is applied to an object or an action (the target) to which it
cannot be literally applied. In the expression “a bright
student”, a student is not an object to which the visual
property of bright is usually applied. Nevertheless, we can
comprehend it effortlessly meaning “clever or intelligent
students”. How is this comprehension achieved? Many
factors have been implicated, namely the familiarity,
conventionality and aptness of a metaphor. These factors
can not only affect the speed of processing (Giora, 2007;
Pierce & Chiappe, 2008), but conventionality and aptness
are also suggested to determine the mechanism of
processing, whether by comparison or by categorisation
(Bowdle & Gentner, 2005; Jones & Estes, 2006).
However, when it comes to understanding exactly how
these three factors affect metaphor comprehension, they
have problems with their theoretical specificity, and
subsequently their operationalisation. Familiarity and
conventionality are often used interchangeably, and they

face the same problem concerning their operational
definitions. They are sometimes assumed to refer to how
often people have encountered the metaphoric expression
itself (e.g., how often is “bright” used to describe “students”?
e.g., Cardillo, Watson, Schmidt, Kranjec, & Chatterjee,
2012; Roncero & de Almeida, 2014a) and sometimes to
how accustomed people are to relating the expression to its
metaphoric meaning (e.g., “bright” meaning intelligent and
quick-witted: Campbell & Raney, 2015; Mashal, Faust,
Hendler, & Jung-Beeman, 2009), but these are two very
different and dissociable theoretical constructs. A particular
linguistic expression might be encountered reasonably often
but remain poorly understood (e.g., purple prose), or a
metaphoric meaning might be encountered reasonably often
via a different expression to the one supplied (e.g.,
“Solution can be bright”).
Aptness also has received different definitions. It is
sometimes assumed to reflect a very general, high-level
quality or goodness of a metaphor and is often
operationalised as such (Haught, 2014), whereas at other
times represents a much more low-level specification of
how well the metaphoric meaning (e.g., intelligent and
quick-witted) fits or overlaps with the target (e.g., “student”:
Chiappe & Kennedy, 1999). In addition, aptness appears to
be theoretically confounded with familiarity and
conventionality. Only apt metaphors are likely to become
conventionalised or familiar, as a metaphor that does not
work well is unlikely to become widely used by speakers of
a language. Because familiarity and conventionality depend
on usage patterns of metaphors across a language, and usage
patterns depend to some extent on aptness, it means that
there is a core dependency between the factors that is not
trivial to disentangle. Indeed, ratings of aptness and
familiarity are highly correlated (r = .73-.82: Campbell &
Raney, 2015; Roncero & de Almeida, 2014a), as are ratings
of aptness and corpus frequency counts of the metaphoric
expression (r = .41-.57: Roncero & de Almeida, 2014b;
Thibodeau & Durgin, 2011).
In summary, familiarity, conventionality and aptness have
all been shown to affect metaphor processing. However,
they have several theoretical and operational problems that
mean they have limited utility in enhancing our
understanding of what makes a metaphor easier to process.
Rather than continuing to vary and refine how these factors
are conceptualised, we propose a different approach to seek
clearer predictors of metaphor processing that (a) are

2604

theoretically and operationally distinct, and (b) are able to
independently account for speed and accuracy performance
in metaphor processing.

Grounded views of language processing
Research in conceptual representation has tended to
operate in parallel to that of traditional metaphor processing,
and therefore takes quite a different perspective on how
access to meaning takes place. Essentially, two components
are employed in the mental representation of meaning when
people process language (Barsalou, Santos, Simmons, &
Wilson, 2008; Connell & Lynott, 2014). The first
component relies on the statistical, distributional pattern of
how words co-occur across contexts (Landauer & Dumais,
1997). The second type of representation is the embodied
(also known as the grounded, sensorimotor or situated)
component, which relies on the process of simulation; that is
the partial reactivation of past perceptual, motor, affective,
introspective and other experiences (Barsalou, 1999).
Together, the linguistic and embodied components can
explain language processing better than either alone (e.g.,
Andrews, Vigliocco, & Vinson, 2009). In particular,
research in the grounded linguistic-embodied approach has
demonstrated that the linguistic distributional information
provides a powerful tool for superficial language processing
because activity of the linguistic component peaks earlier
than that of the embodied simulation component (Louwerse
& Jeuniaux, 2008). People are more likely to rely on the
embodied component when deeper processing is specifically
cued in the task; but people will be reliant upon the
linguistic component to generate a good-enough
approximation (Ferreira, Bailey, & Ferraro, 2002) when
shallow processing can suffice.
In line with these arguments, Connell and Lynott (2013)
proposed that information from the linguistic component
could act as a cognitive triage mechanism during language
processing by providing a guide to whether it is worth
expending effort on costly embodied simulation. If the
linguistic component indicates that future processing is
likely to fail (e.g., the words rarely co-occur in the same
context and so their combined meaning might not be
simulated successfully), then the processing cold be
abandoned before any more cognitive effort is expended by
the embodied component. On the other hand, if the
linguistic component indicates that future processing is
likely to succeed (e.g., the words often co-occur in the same
context and so their combined meaning can probably be
simulated successfully), then it could either inform a
response immediately (i.e., based on the linguistic shortcut
alone) or allow the embodied component to continue
developing a detailed simulation of meaning.
Connell and Lynott's proposal can be applied directly to
the study of metaphor processing, because the interplay of
the linguistic and embodied components, and the role of the
linguistic shortcut as a cognitive triage mechanism, operate
in theory across all types of language comprehension. In this
study, we asked participants to process metaphors that

systematically varied on these two dimensions. The
linguistic component is quantified by linguistic
distributional frequency (LDF), that is how often constituent
words (“bright” and “student”) of a metaphor co-occur in a
large corpus.
The embodied component, on the other hand, is
operationalised by ease of simulation (EoS), a new normed
metric that quantifies how easy it is to come to a mental
representation of a metaphor (Liu, Connell, & Lynott, 2016).
This metric was extracted using a principle components
analysis from the ratings on the sensibility (how much sense
the sentence make if read or heard), usability (how easy it is
to use it in conversation or writing), and imaginability (how
easy it is to describe the concept) in the norming study.
When combined into a single measure, these ratings offer a
proxy for how easy it is to simulate a concept. That is, if
people find it easy to make sense of and use the metaphor,
as well as imagine the concept, they would find it easy to
generate embodied simulations.
Although LDF and EoS may correlate to a certain degree,
we expected them to play distinctive roles in metaphor
processing after the common variance between them is
removed. Both variables would independently affect the
acceptance rate and speed of metaphor processing.
Specifically, increase in both variables would make it more
likely and faster for people to accept a metaphor, and
meanwhile slower to reject the very metaphor. More
crucially, participants performed one of two tasks: a
sensibility judgement task (Experiment 1), which required
relatively shallower processing because participants made
only yes/no response; or an interpretation-generation task
(Experiment 2), which was deeper because they specified
the meaning verbally. We predicted that EoS would play a
greater role in deep processing or when people accepted
metaphors because it indicated successful simulation, while
LDF should play a larger role in shallow processing
especially when people rejected a metaphor as not being
sensible.

Experiment 1: Sensibility Judgement Task
Method
Participants Twenty-eight participants took part (five male
and 23 female), all of whom were students at Lancaster
University and native speakers of English with mean age of
19.1 years (SD = 1.1). The sample size was determined
beforehand to achieve the same level of variability as the
conceptual combination study in Connell and Lynott (2013).
Materials We used a total of 452 metaphoric sentences
taken from Liu et al., (2016). All sentences took the form
“Noun can be adjective” (e.g., Student can be bright), and
were composed of 113 perceptual adjectives (e.g., bright:
Lynott & Connell, 2009), each paired with four nouns that
were capable of eliciting metaphoric meanings that vary
independently on the following two dimensions (see
examples in Table 1):

as dependent variables.

EoS for each sentence ranged from easy to difficult (M =
0.00, SD = 1.00), and was calculated in a novel norming
study by Liu et al. (2016). The scores were a single
principle component extracted from ratings of sensibility,
imaginability and usability of the metaphors. LDF for each
sentence ranged from low to high (M = 2.95, SD = 0.97),
and was calculated as the log of the summed bi- to fivegram frequencies of the sentence’s noun and adjective in the
Google Web1T Corpus (Brants & Franz, 2006). To take the
metaphor “Students can be bright” as an example, the LDF
was the log of the sum of the frequencies of “student …
bright” and “bright … student” with zero, one, two, and
three intervening words.
The sentences were split into four lists, where each
adjective appeared only once per list, and the distribution of
easy/difficult to simulate and high/low distributional
frequency was equal across lists (EoS: F(3, 440) = 1.70, p
= .166; LDF: F(3, 440) = 0.43, p = .734). Each participant
saw only one list.
Procedure Participants read one sentence in each trial and
decided whether or not the sentence made sense. All trials
had the same structure. Participants first saw a fixation cross
for 1000 ms, followed by the noun for 500 ms, followed by
the phrase “can be” for 500 ms, and then followed by the
adjective. The adjective remained onscreen until participants
made a response. Participants pressed either the comma key
(“,”) if they judged that the sentence made sense; or the full
stop key (“.”) if they judged that it did not make sense. The
response could be made without a time limit; and
participants were told explicitly that there were no right or
wrong answers to the question. Both the response decisions
(“yes” to accept the metaphor as sensible; or “no” to reject

Design and Analysis Response decisions were analysed in
a mixed effects logistic regression (binomial distribution
with logit link), with response as the dependent variable
(coded as 1 for “yes”, accepting the metaphor as sensible;
and 0 for “no”, rejecting the metaphor as nonsensical),
participants and items as crossed random factors, and LDF,
EoS, and their interaction as fixed factors. We only
modelled random intercept because models with random
slope failed to converge.
Response times (RTs) were analysed using mixed effects
linear regressions, firstly in an omnibus analysis with
crossed random factors of participants and items, and fixed
factors of response, LDF, EoS, and their interactions. Then,
we ran separate analyses on acceptance (“yes”) and
rejection (“no”) responses because we expect the effects of
the fixed factors to be opposite for “yes’ and “no” responses.
While the increase in LDF and EoS should make it faster to
accept a metaphor, it should make it slower to reject a
metaphor.

Results and Discussion
All participants had mean response times within 3SD of the
overall mean and so all were included in analysis. Two trials
were removed because of motor error (RT < 200ms).
Furthermore, individual trials with RT more than 3SD from
each participant’s mean per response decision were removed
as outliers: 1.33% of “yes” responses and 2.20% of “no”
responses.
Among 3105 valid trials, 1413 (45.51%) were accepted as
sensible (“yes” responses) and 1692 (54.59%) were rejected
as nonsensical (“no” responses). Logistic regression showed
evidence for net suppression. This means that while
metaphors with the “yes” response had a higher mean LDF
than those with the “no” response (i.e. the higher LDF was,
the more likely it should be to respond “yes”), the effect of
LDF in the mixed effects logistic regression turned out
negative (i.e., the higher LDF was, the less likely to respond
“yes”). This suggested that LDF enhanced the effect of

EoS by explaining the residuals of EoS rather than the
variance of response decision. In order to establish the
true relationships between response decision and our
independent variables, we therefore removed the shared
variance between LDF and EoS (currently correlating at r
= .27) by orthogonalising the variables using a principal
components analysis with varimax rotation and Kaisar
normalization on a covariance matrix (Glantz & Slinker,
2000). What this did was to create two new orthogonal
variables (r = 0), each correlating highly with one original
variable (r = .99). These two new variables were thus
named orthogonal EoS and orthogonal LDF. We re-ran
the logistic regression with them and obtained results as
follows (further analyses all used orthogonal variables).
The logistic regression with orthogonal variables
showed that both variables had a positive effect on
response decision. As the EoS increased by one unit, the
odds to accept a metaphor as sensible increased 3.42
times (z(3101) = 25.03, p < .001, 1.23). As the LDF
increased, the odds to accept a metaphor increased with a
marginally significant effect (1.084 times, z(3101) = 1.88,
p = .06, .
RT was also analysed using orthogonal variables. Table
2 shows full results of the omnibus analysis. Overall, EoS
had a positive effect on RT (M = 1139ms, SD = 587ms),
and it critically interacted negatively with response
decision, suggesting that the direction of the EoS effect
differed by the response type, and was greater for “yes”
than “no” responses. LDF had no overall main effect, but
interacted with response decision to indicate that the
direction of LDF differed for “yes” and “no” RTs.
Since we had separate hypotheses for “yes” and “no”
RTs, we divided the dataset by response decision and
analysed their RTs separately. Results are given in Table
3. For “yes” responses (i.e. metaphors that were accepted
as sensible; RT: M = 1150ms, SD = 589ms), the easier a
metaphor was to simulate, the less time people took to
accept it as sensible. Also, the more often the words in a
metaphor co-occurred in language, the faster people were
to accept it as sensible.
For “no” responses (RT: M = 1114ms, SD = 603ms),

the effects ran in the opposite direction (Table 3). As
predicted, people were faster to reject metaphors that
were normally regarded as difficult to simulate.
Furthermore, it interacted with LDF positively, such that
the effect of EoS was reduced when LDF was low (the
for the interaction term was positive).

Experiment 2: Interpretation Generation
Task
Method
In this study, we asked 40 participants (native speakers of
English, 11 males, age: M = 19.65, SD = 2.08) to judge
whether they could think of a meaning for the metaphoric
sentences instead of judging their sensibility. The
procedure was the same as Experiment 1, except that
participants needed to provide their interpretation of the
sentences after they responded “yes”. To reduce the
possibility of fatigue, each participant saw half (56-57) of
the items of Experiment 1.

Results and Discussion
Data cleaning was performed as in Experiment 1.
Furthermore, we also identified accept (“yes”) trials with
invalid interpretations (e.g., blank, “I don’t know”). Two
participants were excluded from analysis for providing
more than 50% invalid interpretations. Amongst the
remaining participants, 2.33% of interpretations were
identified as invalid. For individual trials, 2.10% of “yes”
responses and 2.00% of “no” responses were identified as
outliers.
Among 2103 valid trials, 1302 (61.91%) were accepted
as interpretable whereas 801 (38.09%) were rejected as
uninterpretable. The logistic regression showed that both
EoS and LDF had positive effects on response decision.
For every unit of increase in EoS, the odds of accepting a
metaphor as interpretable increased 2.826 times (z(2099)
= 17.49, p < .001, ; and for every unit of increase
in LDF, the odds of accepting a metaphor increased 1.286

Linear regression of RT across both responses found no
overall effects of either EoS or LDF (see Table 4). However,
EoS interacted negatively with response decision, indicating
the effect of EoS were in opposite directions for “yes” and
“no” responses. Results separated by response decision are
given in Table 5. As predicted, for “yes” responses (RT: M
= 3083ms, SD = 2638ms), EoS had a negative effect,
meaning that people were faster to accept a metaphor as
interpretable when it was typically considered easy to
simulate compared to difficult to simulate. LDF did not
affect the speed of interpretation, nor was there an
interaction. Also as predicted, for “no” responses (RT: M =
2436ms, SD = 2105ms), people were faster to reject a
metaphor as uninterpretable when it was normally
considered difficult to simulate. LDF did not affect rejection
speed, nor did it interact with EoS.
Since we had specific hypothesis with regards to the
depth of processing, we examine such task differences
further in cross-experiment analyses (0 coded for sensibility
judgement task, and 1 for interpretation generation). As
expected, the likelihood of accepting versus rejecting a
metaphor varied by task: the odds to accept a metaphor
increased 3.24 times in deep interpretation generation
compared to shallow sensibility judgement; (z(5200) = 3.39,

p = .001, . As for response time, EoS interacted
with task, showing that the effect is larger for deep
interpretation generation than for shallow sensibility
judgement, as predicted (“Yes”: t(2461.2) = -6.39, p < .001,

The interaction between EoS and LDF also varied across
tasks (t(1933.3) = -2.10, p = .036, which was
larger for shallow than deep processing.

General Discussion
Our goal in taking this grounded approach was to move the
investigation of metaphor processing beyond the traditional
factors of familiarity, conventionality, and aptness, which –
while having a long history of use – have been increasingly
criticised for theoretical and operational problems that limit
their utility in explaining what makes one metaphor easier
to understand than another. Indeed, our study generated
complex results that could not be accounted for by
traditional theories with single factors.
The current study shows for the first time that both
linguistic component (based on linguistic distributional
frequency) and embodied component (based on ease of
simulation norms) affect metaphor comprehension
independently. Their roles are statistically distinct from each

2608

other after we managed to remove their common variance
with a principle components analysis. Whereas ease of
simulation often had a large effect overall and was more
prominent for the “yes” response because that was when
simulation
was
eventually
successful;
linguistic
distributional frequency represents a relatively coarsegrained, but nonetheless highly useful, approximation of
whether a particular source and target have previously
formed a metaphor. It informs people’s responses, not only
making acceptance more likely and faster when the words
are likely to constitute a meaningful representation, but also
flags up potentially unsuccessful simulation to be rejected
right away without further processing when distributional
frequency is low. Our findings are consistent with the
grounded views which suggest that conceptual
representation relies on both embodied simulation and
linguistic distributional pattern ((Barsalou et al., 2008;
Connell & Lynott, 2014; Louwerse & Jeuniaux, 2008).
However, against predictions, the main effect of linguistic
distributional frequency did not differ between shallow and
deep processing tasks according to the cross-experiment
analysis (i.e., linguistic distributional frequency itself did
not interact with task). This null effect could be because the
tasks disincentivised using the linguistic shortcut by
allowing people as much time as needed to make a response.
That is, they had unlimited time resource to form a mental
representation using the embodied component. In future
research, we will impose time constraints on the task in
order to further examine the utility of linguistic
distributional information during metaphor processing, and
provide an additional test of the linguistic shortcut
hypothesis.
