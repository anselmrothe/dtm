                          Introduction
Time perception is essential for human survival. It is a multi-
layered process which covers a wide range of timescales,
from microsecond estimation to the maintaining of the cir-
cadian rhythm. However, there is still a lack of consensus on
the mechanisms behind temporal perception.
   Researchers have proposed several qualitative and quanti-
tative models to explain the data obtained in various tempo-
ral judgement experiments (Jeffress, 1948; Machado, Mal-
heiro, & Erlhagen, 2009; Oprisan & Buhusi, 2011), with In-
ternal Clock Theory being one of the most widely accepted
ones. It suggests that our perception of time highly relies
on the clock speed. Akin to an internal clock, the theory of              Figure 1: Information-processing model for Scalar Ex-

take the probability of a stimulus duration being labeled as

subtracted from 1, i.e. pI = 1 − (pL + pS).
   If the probabilities of the 2 reference memory density dis-
tributions at the stimulus duration are approximately equal,
then the model responds either ‘short’ or ‘long’ with an equal
probability. Otherwise, a choice is made if a given stimulus
is long, short or intermediate depending upon the values of
their respective probability distributions, pL, pS and pI. If the
stimulus is determined to be either the short or the long ref-
erence duration, then the model responds ‘short’ or ‘long’,
respectively. If the stimulus is deemed to be ‘intermediate’,
the model proceeds to step 2.
