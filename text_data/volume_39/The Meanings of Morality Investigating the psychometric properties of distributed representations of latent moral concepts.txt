Abstract: Peopleâ€™s beliefs about what is morally right and wrong vary widely between individuals, contexts, and cultures;
however it is thought that they are governed by core latent constructs. While there is evidence that these constructs are reflected
in natural language, this requires further testing. We demonstrate that the structure of moral values in natural discourse can be
modeled by applying factor analyses to distributed representations of morally relevant terms learned by a neural network. We
first demonstrate that robust latent constructs can be estimated from the covariance of distributed representations of construct
exemplars. We then test whether the factor structure proposed by Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) is reflected in natural
language. Finally, we conduct a bottom-up investigation of the structure of moral values in natural language using freeresponses reported by participants. Ultimately, we find evidence that the representation of moral values in natural language
partially corresponds to MFT.
