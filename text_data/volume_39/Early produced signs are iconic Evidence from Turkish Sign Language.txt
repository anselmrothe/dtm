As part of another study (Taşçı & Sumer, in prep), 4 deaf
signers of TID (Mage = 32.3) were shown a total of 328

think these signs are. Here, the iconicity was defined as
the similarity between the linguistic form (i.e., sign) and
the entity that it refers to, including both the perceptual
and/or action-based properties. In another session, 5 deaf
signers (Mage = 33.4), were asked how familiar they think
these signs are. Both iconicity and familiarity ratings
were on a scale of 1 (not at all iconic/familiar) to 7
