Comparing distributions of truth value judgments to
spatial descriptions: Stimulus set 1. Figure 3 presents a
subset of containment and support items side by side and
respectively shows participants’ average rates of use of in or
on (i.e., proportion of descriptions using in or on) in the
spatial description task (top black bars) and average truth-
value acceptance rates (i.e., proportion of “True”
judgments) on the truth-value judgment task (bottom white
bars). Truth-value acceptance rates were greater than or
equal to rates of expression use for all but 5 containment
items and all but 2 support items2.
   We tested whether measures of spatial expression
meaning and spatial expression use show similar
distributional signatures across the same spatial scenes. Our
reasoning was as follows: if participants are using the same
knowledge in similar ways to make judgments about spatial
expression meaning and decisions about expression use,
then the resulting pattern of truth-value judgments for in and
on should systematically relate to the pattern of in and on
use in descriptions of the same scenes. That is, scenes that
are frequently described with in or on should also show                        Figure 3. Patterns of expression use and truth-value
