STM Performance Index 1: Memory Accuracy Score
We adopted MAS as one index of STM performance. It mea-
sures the probability for which a color can be accurately rec-
ognized. Since FS is continuous in our study, it is necessary
to take MAS also as continuous. We defined the MAS of a
test color as the percentage of the trials where the subjects
correctly recognized the color.
STM Performance Index 2: Error Distance Score The
EDS is adopted as another index of STM performance. EDS
measures the expected error extent in the case of misrecog-
nition. As in Heider (1972)’s and Roberson et al. (2000)’s
studies, the EDS for a test color is defined as the mean of the
color differences between the test color and the colors mis-
taken for the test color in the incorrect recognition trials.        Figure 3: (A)Relationship between Focality Score and Mem-
