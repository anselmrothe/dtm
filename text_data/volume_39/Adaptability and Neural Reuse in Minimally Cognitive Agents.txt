Increased adaptation over time
As most work on evolving minimally cognitive behaviors fo-
cuses on one task, we set out to test whether evidence for
adaptation could be observed in populations under changing
conditions. That is, does learning one task help a population
adapt to new tasks over time?

swaps in 2500 generations. The first 4 are labeled for the
sake of discussion; A1 indicates the first time the popula-
tion achieves fitness threshold for Task A, B1 indicates the
first time population reaches threshold for Task B, etc. This
trajectory shows evidence of adaptation. As can be seen,
the population starts off close to random behavior (0.5) and
rapidly improves performance at the first task Task A: circle-

the population surpasses the established fitness threshold, the
