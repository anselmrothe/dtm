Introduction

non-primed condition) for younger children and elder
people (see review Chapman et al., 1994). On the other
hand, various studies, investigating processes of different
types of relations in semantic priming tasks, revealed that
younger children show priming effects if words are directly
associated only, and not if they exclusively provide a
category relation (e.g. McCauley et al., 1976). So far,
empirical evidence points towards a greater facilitation by
functional/associative relations in comparison to pure
semantic relations in children, but also an increasing
sensitivity for thematic and taxonomic relationships over
age (Arias-Trejo & Plunkett, 2013). In line with this,
younger children tend to freely associate words that have a
syntagmatic relation from mere common occurrence in
sentences relation (e.g. “good” and “boy”) rather than a
paradigmatic relation due to the same form class (e.g.
“good” and “bad”) in comparison to older children and
adults (e.g. White, 1985; Woodrow & Lowell, 1916). This
effect is also known as the syntagmatic-paradigmatic shift
that occurs in an age range between 5 and 9 years (e.g.
Brown & Berko, 1960; Entwisle, 1966, Nelson, 1977).

Starting with pioneer work of Meyer and Schvaneveldt
(1971) a wide range of studies revealed that a target word
(e.g. “chair”) is processed faster and more accurate when a
semantically associated prime word (e.g. “table”) was
presented before (e.g. Bentin et al., 1985; Neely, 1976).
Interestingly, studies differentiating between various types
of associations (e.g. Becker, 1980; Lucas, 2000; McNamara,
2005) and/or individual differences like age (e.g. review
Chapman et al., 1994, McCauley et al., 1976) revealed
inconsistent results with regard to the size and direction of
the semantic priming effect. From a developmental
perspective, the presence (or absence) of the semantic
priming effect may be an indicator of the development and
organization of semantic knowledge (e.g. Lucas, 2000;
McCauley et al., 1976; Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971).
On the one hand, recent research revealed greater semantic
priming effects (i.e. greater difference between primed and

To our knowledge, however, the relative reliance on
syntagmatic and/or paradigmatic information has not yet
been addressed during visual word recognition. As German
children start reading at the age of 6, we hypothesized that
word-decoding abilities sufficient for syntagmatic effects
should be apparent around the age of 7 years, i.e. in the 2nd
grade, while a stronger reliance on paradigmatic information
should be observable around the age of 9, i.e. in the 4 th
grade. So far, most semantic priming studies used free
association performance of adults to predict semantic
priming (e.g., Lucas, 2000), though already Jung (1905)
stated that free associations are diagnostic for
interindividual differences. Therefore, it is questionable
whether its usage as an independent variable for the study of
children is appropriate (see Hofmann & Jacobs , 2014). To
derive a semantic long-term memory structure from

Abstract
The Associative Read-Out Model (AROM) suggests that
associations between words can be defined by the log likelihood
that they occur together more often in sentences than predicted by
their single-word frequency. Moreover, semantic relations can be
defined by associative spreading across many common associates.
Here, we addressed developmental effects of associative and
semantic priming. Thus, we manipulated sentence-co-occurrencebased direct (syntagmatic) and common (paradigmatic)
associations between prime and target words in 2nd and 4th graders.
Syntagmatic associations decreased response times and error rates
in both, 2nd and 4th graders. Paradigmatic associations increased
errors rates in 2nd graders, whereas they decreased errors rates in
4th graders. These results suggest that 2nd graders profit from
syntagmatic, i.e. contiguity-based associations, while a benefit
from paradigmatic-semantic relationship probably develops from
generalizing across many of these simple associations.

experience with a sample of text (Hofmann et al., 2011), a
recent interactive activation model (IAM; McClelland &
Rumelhart, 1981) relies on co-occurrence statistics. The
Associative Read-Out Model (AROM, Hofmann et al.,
2011) is the first IAM with an implemented semantic layer.
It defines two words as associated, if they co-occur more
often together in sentences than predicted by their single
occurrence frequency (Dunning, 1993; Quasthoff et al.,
2006). Thus, it reflects a symbolic Hebbian learning
approach (Hebb, 1949) by suggesting higher association
strengths for words that are occurring more often together
than predicted by the frequency-driven orthographic
activation.
The AROM already successfully predicted behavioral and
electrophysiological data for tasks, in which memory is
explicitly required. Hofmann et al. (2011) showed that the
correct identification of studied words as well as the false
recognition of non-studied words is significantly higher for
words with many associations in a recognition memory task.
This result has recently been extended by Stuellein et al.
(2016) in an EEG study by showing significant response
time, P200 and N400 effects for words with many
associations. It was an open question, however, to what
extend these results were induced by pure direct
associations and/or indirect associations like semantic
feature overlap (Stuellein et al., 2016). As the AROM
defines words as associated by the frequency of their
common occurrence, it is in line with localist theories
proposing direct associative links between symbolic
representations to capture the meaning of a word (e.g.,
Anderson, 1983; Collins and Loftus, 1975). Whereas
distributed models define the meaning of a word by a
distribution across subsymbolic ‘hidden’ units (e.g.
McClelland and Rogers, 2003), this assumption is in line
with other co-occurrence based models, defining the
meaning of a word by latent factors determining with which
words they co-occur (e.g. Landauer and Dumais, 1997). In
the tradition of distributed models, one can assume that
words that often occur together in similar sentence contexts
might share similar semantic features. In line with the idea,
that the meaning of a word is determined by its surrounding
context (Firth, 1957; Harris, 1951), common associates of
two words can possibly be considered as common features
(Hofmann and Jacobs, 2014). As a consequence, a more
complex AROM, that would be able to simulate the
dynamic co-activation of such semantic features, was
discussed to be a plausible option to accommodate both
perspectives (Stuellein et al., 2016).
In a recent study, Roelke et al. (2016, subm.) also tested the
AROM in an implicit memory task. During primed lexical
decision, a full factorial manipulation of direct association
(strong/no) and the number of common associates
(many/no) of prime and target revealed strong effects in
adult participants. Prime and target words with direct and
many common associates facilitated visual word
recognition. In contrast, we also have preliminary evidence

of inhibitory priming effects at a very long SOA (Schmidt,
2015). These results are in line with recent studies, showing
only facilitating effects for pure associative relations and
inhibitory or facilitatory effects for semantic relations that
are dependent on the time that the prime is processed (e.g.
see Plaut & Booth, 2000).

The present study
To investigate whether the AROM can be used to address
the syntagmatic-paradigmatic shift by relying on direct
(associative, syntagmatic) and indirect (semantic,
paradigmatic) relations, we tested 2 and 4 grade students
from two German elementary schools, using primed lexical
decision. In line with recent results, we expected smaller
semantic priming effects for younger children for semantic
(indirect) relations. Furthermore, we expected greater
semantic priming effects for associative (direct) relations in
comparison to semantic (indirect) relations for all children,
because these depend on an abstraction of experience-based
knowledge.

Second grade. Behavioral data were collected for 95 2
grade students of two primary schools in Solingen,
Germany. Two students did not complete the experiment
due to the task difficulty. Another eleven participants had to
be excluded because of reading/writing disorders and two
participants because of lacking German skills. The mean age
of the remaining 75 students (female=45) was 7.46 years
(SD=.502). According to their parents, 62 (82.7%)
participants had learned German as their first language.
Three children (4%) learned Turkish as their first language,
followed by Italian (N=2, 2.7 %) and Russian (N=2, 2.7%).
The remaining students came from a variety of linguistic
background. For one student, data for the native language
was missing.

Fourth Grade. Behavioral data were collected for 86 4
grade students of two primary schools in Solingen,
Germany. Ten students had to be excluded because of
reading/writing disorders. The mean age of the remaining 76
students (female=52) was 9.54 years (SD=.738). According
to their parents, 62 participants (81.6%) had learned German

Procedure

Corpora. The word stimuli were taken from the word
corpus “childLex”, which is based on approximately 5000
German books for children between 6 and 12 years
(Schroeder et al., 2015; status: September 2014). The books
vary in length and content with about 5000 to 15,000
words per book. We used words that were among the list for
6 to 10 year old children. As the childLex corpus is not
openly available for analyses, co-occurrence statistics were
taken from the German corpus of the “Wortschatz” project
(status: December 2006; Quasthoff et al., 2006). This corpus
is largely composed of online newspaper (1992-2006).
Based on 800 million tokens and 43 million sentences, two
words were considered to be directly associated when they
co-occurred more often together in sentences than predicted
by their single occurrence frequency (Dunning, 1993).
Indirect associations were defined as the number of
common direct associates.

Cover story. The instruction was embedded in a cover
story, adapted from a children’s lexical decision task by
Richter et al. (2013). Children were asked to help an
extraterrestrial named Reli, who came to earth to learn the
language of the earthlings, to distinguish between real words
and nonwords (Target). To further explain the appearance of
the prime words, students were told that another
extraterrestrial named Gudra also wanted to learn the
language of the earthlings (Prime). Students were told that
other children were helping Gudra, so that they had to read
her word but that they did not have to react.

Stimuli. The stimulus set consisted of 160 primes and 160
targets. The 160 primes and 80 targets were German nouns.
The remaining 80 targets consisted of 40 pronounceable
pseudowords and 40 random letter strings. Pseudowords
were created by changing one to three consonants of real
nouns. 80 targets were German nouns that were split into
four word conditions in a 2x2 design with the factors direct
association (high vs. low) and indirect relation (high vs.
low). Prime and target were considered to provide a low
direct association, when they were not associated at all
(association strength=0) and as high directly associated,
when they were beyond a 2,5%-quantile criterion
(association strength > 3) of all possible stimuli (N=6,975;
cf. Hofmann et al., 2011, for a formal definition of
association strength). They were considered to provide a
low indirect relation, when they had less than 65 common
associates (below a 2,5%-quantile criterion of all possible
stimuli) and were considered to provide a high indirect
association, when they had more than 300 common
associates (beyond a 2,5%-quantile criterion of all possible
stimuli; cf. Bordag, 2007, for counts of common associates).
From the childLex corpus, the word features frequency,
word length and Orthographic Levenstein Distance
(Yarkoni et al., 2008) were counterbalanced between the
four word conditions for prime and target words to rule out
confounding effects (condition differences p > .05). Raw
Lemma-Frequency was log10 transformed and words below
and beyond a 2,5%-quantile frequency criterion of all
possible stimuli were excluded. Word and nonword length
was limited from 3 to 6 letters. Before counterbalancing to
rule out confounding variables, a manual examination of the
stimulus set excluded inappropriate words for children (e.g.
those with sexual content), prime and target pairs with the
same first letter and compounds (e.g. “snowball”).

Semantic Priming Task. The semantic priming task was
performed by groups of eight to ten students at the same
time in a quiet room, separated from the rest of the class.
Before the experiment started, the time course of the
experiment was written on the blackboard and the task was
explained to the children in front of the class. Each student
worked on his/her own on a separate laptop. Students were
asked to put on headphones and to leave on the headphones
during the whole task. Before the task started, a detailed
instruction was presented once more in a videoclip with the
extraterrestrial Reli.
First a fixation cross was presented for 1000 ms on the
screen. Then a prime word was presented in grey letters for
600 ms. The students were asked to read the prime but not
to press a button. After the prime word, a blank screen
appeared for 200 ms, after which the target word was
presented in black letters. Students were asked to press a
green button with their right forefinger on the keyboard
(“K”), if the presented stimulus was a real word and to press
a red button with their left forefinger on the keyboard (“D”)
if the presented stimulus was a nonword. The target word
stayed on the screen until the student pressed one of the two
buttons. Following another blank screen for 500 ms, the
word “Bereit?” (‘ready?’) was presented in red letters on the
screen and students were asked to press a yellow button
(“space”) with one of their thumbs on the keyboard, if they
wanted to go to the next trial (s. Figure 1).
To get used to the task, five exercise trials were presented at
the beginning. For the exercise trials, feedback was
provided whether the response was correct or not. For the
main task, no feedback was provided. During the main task,
two breaks were included, each after 56-57 trials. The
students decided on their own by pressing the yellow button
when to continue with the main task.

high directly associated (M=3.50, SD=1.90) led to fewer
errors (t=-9.89, p=.000) than words that were low directly
associated (M=5.71, SD=2.60). For 4th graders high directly
associated words (M=1.74, SD=1.24) led also to
significantly fewer errors (t=-12.32, p=.000) than words that
were low directly associated (M=3.95, SD=2.08).
Furthermore, for 2nd graders words with many common
associates (M=4.84, SD=2.29) led to significantly more
errors (t=2.481, p=.015) than words with few common
associates (M=4.37, SD=2.16). Whereas for 4th graders
words with many common associates (M=2.68, SD=1.82)
led to significantly fewer errors (t=-2.116, p=.038) than
words with few common associates (M=3.01, SD=1.48).
Figure 1: Time course of the experiment
At the beginning of the main task and after every break two
“icebreaker trials” were included, that were excluded from
data analyses. For every participant, the order of the
presented prime-target pairs was randomized. Students were
asked to react as fast and as accurate as possible.
Data Analysis. Results were analyzed using general linear
mixed-effect models with the fixed effects grade (2nd vs. 4th
class), direct association (low vs. high) and indirect
association (low vs. high), their interaction terms and the
random intercepts subject and item. The dependent variables
were accuracy and response times. For accuracy analysis we
used binary logistic regression and for response time
analysis we used linear model. Because the degrees of
freedom are not exactly known in LMM analyses, we chose
2 standard errors as significance criterion (i.e. t >= 2; cf.
Baayen et al., 2008, footnote 1; Masson & Kliegl, 2013).
Incorrect responses and those plus/minus a 3 standard
deviation criterion from average for each subject and
condition were excluded from response time analyses. We
only report main effects and interactions between the
experimental factors that are significant. When models
revealed significant interactions between at least two of the
experimental factors, post-hoc t-tests were conducted.

Response time
Grade and direct association led to a significant
contribution to the model (all t ‘s>=2). The positive effects
of grade (β=1.103,t= 8.99, SE=.12) and direct association
(β=0.19, t= 3.06, SE=.08) indicate that 4th grade students
responded faster than 2nd grade students and in general
students responded faster for words that were directly
associated (s. Figure 3).

Accuracy
Grade and direct association and the significant interactions
grade*direct association and grade*indirect association led
to significant contributions to the model (all t‘s>= 2). The
positive effects of grade (β=1.273, t=7.08, SE=.18) and
direct association (β=1.191, t=3.12, SE=.382) indicate that
direct associations increased accuracy, and that 4 grade
students made fewer mistakes than 2 grade students (s. also
Figure 2). The analysis also revealed a significant
interaction between direct associations and grade (β=0.360, t=-2.95, SE=.122). Moreover, we obtained an
interaction of indirect association and grade (β=-0.395,
t=-3.33 SE=.119).

AROM thus may capture individual differences such as age
by differential associative excitation and inhibition scaling
parameters within the semantic representation layer.
The syntagmatic-paradigmatic shift in children is well
known (e.g. Entwisle, 1966). De Saussure’s (1959) coined
the term “syntagmatic” as an associative relation between
words that typically co-occur in a linear combination (cf.
Hofmann & Jacobs, 2014). He further proposes a second
type of relation, i.e. that words are associated when “they
have something in common” (1959, p. 123). In
computational linguistics, the number of common associates
is used to define paradigmatic relations: “For example, the
semantic similarity of the words red and blue can be derived
from the fact that they both frequently co-occur with words
like color, flower, dress, car, dark, bright, beautiful, and so
forth” (Rapp, 2002, p. 1). We think that simple withinsentence co-occurrence provides an intelligible, transparent
and performance-independent explanation of differential
effects during reading development.

Discussion
To test whether the AROM can account for a developmental
shift from associative-syntagmatic (direct) to semanticparadigmatic (indirect) relations during visual word
recognition, we analyzed the performance of 75 2 grade
and 76 4 grade children of two German elementary schools
in a semantic priming task. Direct (syntagmatic)
associations decreased errors in 2 graders as well as in 4
grade students. The analysis of indirect (paradigmatic)
relations revealed a significant interaction of grade and
paradigmatic associations: while paradigmatic associations
led to inhibitory effects in 2nd graders (more errors), they led
to facilitating effects in 4th graders (fewer errors). Thus,
children may develop the ability to generalize across
common associations between the second and the fourth
grade.

Our results fit into a reading development model, in which
category knowledge is gradually abstracted and develops
from functional, event-based knowledge. Response
differences may result from the addition from new
structures within an associative network, instead of a
complete reorganization (e.g. McCauley et al., 1976).
Consistent with this, Nelson (1977) assumed that children
first represent semantic knowledge as spatial or temporal
scripts (e.g. “eating lunch”) and gradually abstract and
define categories from this script-based knowledge.
Our results also show that the Associative Read-Out Model
(Hofmann et al., 2011) is sufficient to define both,
associative-syntagmatic and semantic-paradigmatic
perspectives by co-occurrence statistics, and thus provides a
computational window into developmental effects of visual
word recognition. Future more explicit simulations with an

We are aware of the fact, that the priming effects might also
be driven by factors like positional-syntactic information
(e.g. Hofmann, Biemann, & Remus, 2017). Thus, future
studies may also investigate the influence of syntactic
information by using not only simple nouns from the word
corpora, but also words from other syntactic classes or
prime-target pairs spanning differential word classes (e.g.,
verbs, adjectives etc.). Further studies may also investigate
whether computational models that reduce the amount of
latent semantic dimensions can provide generalization
capabilities that may account for more variance than the
simple amount of common associates (e.g. Landauer &
Dumais, 1997).
