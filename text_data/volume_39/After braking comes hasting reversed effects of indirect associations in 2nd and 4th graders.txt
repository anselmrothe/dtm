class), direct association (low vs. high) and indirect
association (low vs. high), their interaction terms and the
random intercepts subject and item. The dependent variables
were accuracy and response times. For accuracy analysis we
used binary logistic regression and for response time
analysis we used linear model. Because the degrees of
freedom are not exactly known in LMM analyses, we chose
2 standard errors as significance criterion (i.e. t >= 2; cf.
Baayen et al., 2008, footnote 1; Masson & Kliegl, 2013).
Incorrect responses and those plus/minus a 3 standard
deviation criterion from average for each subject and
condition were excluded from response time analyses. We
only report main effects and interactions between the
experimental factors that are significant. When models
revealed significant interactions between at least two of the
experimental factors, post-hoc t-tests were conducted.
