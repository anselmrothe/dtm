   Experiment 1 included easy and difficult sets of questions
in each domain. Mirroring this design would be difficult for
algebraic equation solving because skills are likely to vary
widely across participants. Instead, we divided the partici-
pants into two groups based on a median split of their per-
ceived difficulty. Perceived difficulty was measured by tak-
ing perceived difficulty for the self minus perceived difficulty
for other participants. The easy group perceived the task as
easier for them than for others (N = 18, Mdifficulty = −1.28)
and the hard group perceived the task as harder for them than
for others (N = 21, Mdifficulty = 2.52). In the easy group,
