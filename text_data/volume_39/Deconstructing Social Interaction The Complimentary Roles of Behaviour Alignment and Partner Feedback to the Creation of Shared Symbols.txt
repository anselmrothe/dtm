Abstract
This paper experimentally tests the contribution of two
distinct aspects of social interaction to the creation of
shared symbols: behaviour alignment and concurrent
partner feedback. Pairs of participants (N= 120, or 60
pairs) completed an experimental-semiotic game,
similar to Pictionary, in which they tried to communicate
a range of recurring meanings to a partner by drawing
on a shared whiteboard (without speaking or using
numbers of letters in their drawings). The opportunity
for sign alignment and/or concurrent partner feedback
was manipulated in a full factorial design. Each process
made a distinct contribution to the evolution of shared
symbols:
sign
alignment
directly
influenced
communication success, and concurrent partner
feedback drove sign simplification and symbolization.
These complimentary processes led to the interactive
evolution
of
effective
and
efficient
human
communication systems.

Introduction
Human cognition and behaviour is dominated by
symbol use, evident from our everyday use of numeric
and linguistic systems. But where do these symbols
come from? This question is presented by Harnad
(1990) as the symbol grounding problem: how shared
meanings can arise from arbitrary symbols in the
absence of a pre-established shared symbol system.
A solution to the symbol grounding problem was
offered by Peirce (1931), who suggested that symbols
evolved from iconic signs that share a non-arbitrary
correspondence between the sign and its meaning.
This icon-to-symbol transition has been convincingly
demonstrated in experimental-semiotic communication
games. These experiments examine the creation of
novel human communication systems under controlled
laboratory conditions (for reviews see Fay, Ellison, &
Garrod, 2014; Galantucci, 2017; Tamariz, 2017). They
do this by using a paradigm in which human
participants communicate without using their existing
shared language. Typically, participants communicate
in a novel modality, for example, through drawing
(Galantucci, 2005; Garrod, Fay, Lee, Oberlander, &
MacLeod, 2007; Healy, Swoboda, Umata, & King,
2007; Roberts, Lewandowski, & Galantucci, 2015) or

by gesture (Christensen, Fusaroli, & Tylén, 2016; Fay,
Arbib, & Garrod, 2013; Schouwstra & de Swart, 2014;
Stolk, Verhagen, & Toni, 2016) and the experimenters
examine how the communication systems arise and
evolve over repeated interactions.
A key finding is the importance of iconic signs and
social interaction to the creation of shared symbols
(Galantucci, 2005; Garrod et al., 2007). In Garrod et
al. (2007), pairs of participants tried to communicate a
set of recurring meanings to their partner by drawing
on a shared whiteboard. Like the game Pictionary,
participants were not allowed to speak or use letters or
numbers in their drawings. This procedure forced
participants to create a novel communication system
from scratch. Over repeated interactions three things
happened: communication success improved, the
signs used were transformed from complex iconic
signs to simpler, more symbolic signs, and participants
increasingly used the same signs to communicate the
same meanings (i.e., their signs aligned; see Figure
1). This pattern, the creation of an effective inventory
of shared symbols, has been widely replicated
(Caldwell & Smith, 2012; Fay, Garrod, Roberts, &
Swoboda, 2010; Garrod, Fay, Rogers, Walker, &
Swoboda, 2010; Theisen, Oberlander, & Kirby, 2010).
These studies indicate that social interaction is
crucial to the creation of effective and efficient human
communication systems, but they are not clear on the
precise mechanisms driving these outcomes. To better
understand this, the present experiment isolates two
important aspects of social interaction – behaviour
alignment and concurrent partner feedback – and
investigates the contribution of each to the evolution of
shared symbols.
Pickering and Garrod (2004) argue that linguistic
alignment drives successful communication. While
there is a correlation between referential alignment
and communication success (Fay, Lister, Ellison, &
Goldin-Meadow, 2014; Fusaroli et al., 2012; Reitter &
Moore, 2014), the causal role of referential alignment
on communication success is unclear. If referential
alignment directly influences communication success,
then prohibiting interacting participants from aligning
their signs will lower communication success.
Concurrent partner feedback can take a variety of
forms. During conversation, listeners are co-narrators
who provide verbal feedback (e.g., saying “mhm” while
listening to a speaker) and visual feedback (e.g.,

1991

frowning or nodding), that improves the flow of
conversation (Bavelas, Coates, & Johnson, 2000;
Clark & Krych, 2004; Mein, Fay, & Page, 2016). Like
listeners in a conversation, participants engaged in an
experimental-semiotic game can signal their attention
and understanding by annotating their partner’s sign,
e.g., by adding a tick mark (see Figure 1). During
conversation listeners can indicate a communication
breakdown and initiate a repair (e.g., by asking the
speaker for clarification; Dingemanse et al., 2015;
Schegloff, 2000). In addition to these information
expansion requests, listeners can drive information
contraction by indicating their understanding (e.g., by
saying “yeah, yeah”). So, concurrent partner feedback
during an experimental-semiotic game may drive
communication
success
and
sign
simplification/symbolization.
The present experiment examined the influence of
sign alignment and concurrent partner feedback on
communication success and sign symbolization. It
also tested if each process operates independently or
if they interact.

Figure 1. Sign simplification and alignment for the
meaning ‘Museum’ across 6-games between a pair of
participants in the present experiment. Participants
alternated drawing and identifying roles from game to
game. At Game 1 Museum was communicated using
a complex iconic sign that included a dinosaur, an
exhibit space and two viewers. By Game 6 the sign
has lost much of its initial iconicity, evolving into a
simpler, more symbolic representation, communicated
by the dinosaur’s spine. In addition, partners’ signs
became increasingly similar, or aligned, across games.

Method
The experiment received approval from the University
of Western Australia Ethics Committee. All participants
viewed an information sheet before giving written
consent to take part in the study. The information
sheet and consent form were both approved by the
aforementioned Ethics Committee.

Participants
One-hundred and twenty undergraduate students (84
females) participated in exchange for course credit or
payment. Participants were tested in unacquainted
pairs in testing sessions lasting 1 hour. All participants
were free of any uncorrected visual impairment.

Task and Procedure
Participant tried to graphically communicate a series of
confusable meanings to their partner. Like the game
Pictionary, participants were prohibited from speaking
or using letters or numbers in their drawings. The
Director would draw each meaning from their ordered
list (16 targets plus 4 distractors; see Table 1 for a
complete listing) and their partner, the Matcher, would

try to identify each meaning from their randomly
ordered list of the same meanings.
The task was administered using a virtual
whiteboard tool (Healy, Swoboda, & King, 2002),
which recorded all drawing activity. Each participant
sat at a computer terminal where drawing input and
meaning selection was made via a standard mouse.
For the Director, each to-be-communicated meaning
was highlighted in white text on a dark background at
the top of the interface. Holding down the left mouse
button initiated drawing.
Director drawing was
restricted to black ink and Matcher drawing was
restricted to green ink (to distinguish between
participants). By clicking an erase button on the
interface participants were able to erase parts of the
drawing.
All drawing and erasing activity was
displayed simultaneously on the Director and
Matcher’s shared virtual whiteboards.
When the
matcher believed they had identified the director’s
intended meaning they clicked the relevant button at
the top of their interface, where there was a list of
buttons corresponding to the competing meanings.
Meaning selection brought the current trial to an end
and initiated the next trial. No time limit was imposed,
and participants were given no explicit feedback with
regard to their communication success. Participants
communicated remotely across networked computers
and were unaware of their partner’s identity.

communicated to Matchers (distractor meanings given

The experiment examined the contribution of
behaviour alignment and concurrent partner feedback
to communication success and sign symbolization.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of four
conditions that represented a combination of the
factors of interest: +Alignment +Feedback (N= 30, or
15 dyads), +Alignment -Feedback (N= 30, or 15
interacting), -Alignment +Feedback (N= 30, or 15
dyads) and -Alignment -Feedback (N= 30, or 15
dyads). In the -Alignment conditions participants were
instructed not to copy their partner’s drawings. They
were told they would have to use a different sign to
that used by their partner to communicate each
meaning. In the -Feedback conditions Matchers were
unable to provide within-trial feedback. Specifically,
they were unable to draw while acting as the Matcher
(this functionality was removed from the virtual
whiteboard tool). In this condition the Director clicked
a send button when they had finished their drawing.
Once done the list of competing meanings became
available for selection by the Matcher. Thus, Matchers
were unable to interrupt the Director’s communication
and bring the trial to an end.

Results
Participants followed the instructions not to align their
signs (manipulation check). Not being able to align
their signs reduced communication success.
By
contrast, eliminating the opportunity for concurrent
partner feedback did not directly affect communication
success. Concurrent partner feedback affected sign
simplification; when feedback was eliminated the signs
produced were more complex. Sign alignment also
affected sign simplification, but the effect was much
weaker compared to the effect of concurrent partner
feedback.
See Figure 2 for examples of sign
alignment and simplification in the different conditions.

Figure 2.
Sign alignment, simplification and
symbolization for the meaning ‘Parliament’ across 6games between participants in the different
experimental conditions. Participants instructed not to
copy their partner’s sign for each meaning did so: one
participant drew a building with a flag to communicate
‘Parliament’ and their partner drew a speaker at a
podium (-Alignment +Feedback condition); another
drew a parliamentary speaker with a hammer, and
their partner drew a series of buildings (-Alignment Feedback condition). When permitted to copy their
partner’s signs, sign alignment was observed: onto a
flag (+Alignment +Feedback condition), or people
seated around a table (+Alignment -Feedback
condition). These examples highlight the diversity of
signs used to communicate the same meaning in the
present study. Concurrent partner feedback had a
strong effect on sign simplification and symbolization:
with feedback the signs were dramatically simplified
across games (+Feedback conditions), and without
feedback they retained considerable sign complexity
(-Feedback conditions).

Manipulation Check: Sign Alignment
Participants in the -Alignment conditions were
instructed not to copy the drawings produced by their
partner. Sign alignment was quantified by rating the
similarity of pairs of drawings of the same meaning
from each pair (at Game 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6) on a
Likert scale from 0-9, where 0= very dissimilar and 9=
very similar (BW). 4800 pairs of drawings were rated
for similarity (16 meanings X 5 pairs of adjacent
games X 15 pairs X 4 conditions). Sign alignment
scores for the drawings produced in the different
conditions are shown in Figure 3. The results indicate
that participants followed the -Alignment instructions:
those permitted to copy their partner’s signs showed

increasing sign alignment across games, whereas
those not permitted to copy their partner’s signs
returned lower overall sign alignment scores that did
not change across games.
Drawing alignment scores were entered into a
mixed-design ANOVA that treated Alignment
(+Alignment, -Alignment) and Feedback (+Feedback,
-Feedback) as between-participant factors and Game
(1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6) as a within-participant factor.
This returned a statistically significant Alignment by
2
Game interaction [FLinear(1,56)= 50.849, p< 0.001, η p=
0.564]. The interaction effect is explained by the
increase in sign alignment scores across games in the
+Alignment conditions [FLinear(1,29)= 131.622, p<
2
0.001, η p= 0.819] and a null effect of Game in the
-Alignment conditions [FLinear(1,29)= 0.851, p= 0.364].
The Alignment manipulation worked.

each pair) for the different conditions across games
1-6. The horizontal dashed red line indicates neutral
sign alignment. The dark blue straight line is the linear
model fit and the light grey shaded area is the 95%
confidence interval.

No outliers were identified using the Interquartile
Range rule (Moore, McCabe, & Craig, 1993). Drawing
alignment scores were entered into a mixed-design
ANOVA that treated Alignment (+Alignment, Alignment)
and
Feedback
(+Feedback,
-Feedback) as between-participant factors and Game
(1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6) as a within-participant factor.
This returned a statistically significant Alignment by
2
Game interaction [FLinear(1,56)= 50.849, p< 0.001, η p=
0.564]. The interaction effect is explained by the
strong increase in sign alignment scores across
games in the +Alignment conditions [FLinear(1,29)=
2
131.622, p< 0.001, η p= 0.819] and a null effect of
Game in the -Alignment conditions [FLinear(1,29)=
0.851, p= 0.364].
The Alignment manipulation worked: participants
who were allowed to copy their partner’s drawings did
so, and increasingly did so across games, whereas
those who were prohibited from doing so did not copy
their partner’s drawings.

Communication Success
Communication success was operationalized as the
percentage of meanings accurately identified by the
Figure 4 shows the change in
Matcher.
communication success (%) across games 1-6 in the
different conditions. The results show an increase in
communication success across games in all
conditions, but the increase is stronger in the
+Alignment conditions compared to the -Alignment
conditions.
One outlier (0.28% of data) was identified using the
Interquartile Range rule (see Moore et al., 1993). This
value was replaced by next lowest value.
The
communication success scores were then entered into
the same mixed-design ANOVA used previously. This
returned a statistically significant Alignment by Game
2
interaction [FLinear(1,56)= 135.151, p< 0.001, η p=
0.707].
In all conditions communication success
improved across games: +Alignment conditions
2
[FLinear(1,29)= 117.268, p< 0.001, η p= 0.802] and
-Alignment conditions [FLinear(1,29)= 38.435, p< 0.001,
2
η p= 0.570]. However, the improvement in
communication success (differences score: game 6 game 1) was stronger in the +Alignment conditions
(M= 24.17, SD= 12.031) compared to the -Alignment
conditions (M= 13.96, SD= 13.993), t(58)= 3.030,
p=0.004, d= 0.782. The same pattern of results was
returned when the communication success data was
analyzed using logistic mixed effects modeling.
Sign alignment improved communication success,
establishing a causal link between behaviour
alignment and communication success. By contrast,
concurrent partner feedback did not directly influence
communication success [p= 0.871].

for each pair) for the different conditions across games
1-6. The dark blue straight line is the linear model fit
and the light grey shaded area is the 95% confidence
interval.

Sign Simplification and Symbolization
Following Garrod et al., (2007) simpler signs were
considered to be more symbolic. Sign complexity was
measured using Pelli et al.’s (2006) information

theoretic measure of perimetric complexity [Perimetric
2
complexity = (inside + outside perimeter) /ink area].
Previous work indicates this to be an effective scalefree measure of drawing complexity (Fay et al., 2010;
Garrod et al., 2007; Tamariz & Kirby, 2014). Sign
complexity scores for the drawings produced in the
different conditions are shown in Figure 5. Sign
complexity tended to decrease across games in all
conditions, but sign complexity was lower in the
+Feedback conditions compared to the -Feedback
conditions.

Figure 5. Change in sign complexity (plotted for each
pair) for the different conditions across games 1-6.
The dark blue straight line is the linear model fit and
the light grey shaded area is the 95% confidence
interval.

Ten outliers (2.78% of data) were identified using
the Interquartile Range rule. These values were
replaced by the next highest value.
The sign
complexity scores were then entered into the same
mixed-design ANOVA used previously. This returned
a statistically significant three-way Alignment by
Feedback by Game interaction [FLinear(1,56)= 4.140, p=
2
0.047, η p= 0.069]. To understand the three-way
interaction separate Alignment by Game ANOVAs
were carried out for each level of Feedback. For the
+Feedback conditions this returned a main effect of
2
Game [FLinear(1,28)= 73.809, p< 0.001, η p= 0.725] with
no other effects reaching statistical significance (ps>
0.304). So, both +Feedback conditions showed a
similarly strong decrease in sign complexity scores
across games, and there was no statistical evidence
that sign alignment affected sign symbolization. A
different pattern was returned by the -Feedback
conditions. ANOVA returned a statistically significant
Alignment by Game interaction [FLinear(1,28)= 6.608,
p< 0.016, η2p= 0.191]. This interaction effect is
explained by the statistically significant decrease in
sign complexity scores across games in the
+Alignment -Feedback condition [FLinear(1,14)= 34.912,
p< 0.016, η2p= 0.714] and the null effect of Game in
the -Alignment -Feedback condition [FLinear(1,14)=
2.825, p= 0.115]. So, in the absence of concurrent
partner feedback, sign alignment reduced sign

complexity. Without either interactive process there
was no statistical evidence of a reduction in sign
complexity across games.
Receiving concurrent partner feedback was
important to sign simplification and symbolization. In
the absence of concurrent partner feedback sign
alignment reduced sign complexity, but not to the
extent of concurrent partner feedback.

Discussion
The present study investigated the precise role played
by two distinct aspects of social interaction to the
evolution
of
effective
and
efficient
human
communication systems: behaviour alignment and
concurrent partner feedback.
By experimentally
manipulating the opportunity for behaviour alignment
and concurrent partner feedback in a full factorial
design, the experiment demonstrated that each
process made a distinct contribution to the evolution of
shared symbols: sign alignment directly influenced
communication success and concurrent partner
feedback drove sign simplification and symbolization.
See Lister and Fay (in press) for a theoretical model of
this process. Together, these complimentary
processes explained the interactive evolution of
effective and efficient human communication systems.
Our findings provide a solution the symbol grounding
problem (Harnad, 1990). Complex iconic signs ground
shared meanings. Once grounded, social interaction
drives sign simplification and alignment, the
mechanisms through which effective and efficient
shared symbols arise. This explanation offers a
convincing candidate process through which iconic
signs evolve into symbols, as originally proposed by
Charles Sanders Peirce over 100 years ago.
Other-initiated repairs are a frequent feature of
conversation, and similar repair mechanisms are seen
across a range of different languages (Dingemanse et
al., 2015). Repairs – from a generic ‘huh’, to specific
information requests – signal trouble and correct
breakdowns in communication (Schegloff, 2000;
Schegloff, Jefferson, & Sacks, 1977). Other-initiated
repairs were a frequent feature of communication in
the +Feedback conditions, especially in the early
games of the task (25.83%, 17.92%, 13.75%, 11.25%,
7.91%, 2.91% of trials at Game 1-6). Yet, there was
no evidence that this feedback directly affected
communication success (19.16%-point improvement in
communication success from game 1 to 6 with partner
feedback, and a 19.95%-point improvement in
communication success from game 1 to 6 without
partner feedback (collapsed across the alignment
conditions). By contrast, concurrent partner feedback
was crucial to sign simplification and symbolization.
Why might other-initiated repairs not directly affect
communication success? A simple answer is that
people may not be sensitive to problems in
communication in the first place. This was examined
in a study in which conversation partners, who
communicated via text-chat, were swapped with
participants engaged in a separate and unrelated
conversation
(Galantucci
&
Roberts,
2014).
Participants failed to notice their conversation partner
had changed (beyond chance level), despite the
incoherent change in topic. This finding suggests that

communication is noisy and error-prone, and that
people tend to be insensitive to communication
problems. Perhaps our task is too simple to be able to
detect the positive influence of other-initiated repairs
on communication success. Against this, our
experimental paradigm was sensitive to the positive
influence of behaviour alignment on communication
success.
Our experimental findings demonstrate that
behaviour alignment directly influenced communication
success.
By contrast, there was no statistical
evidence that other-initiated repairs directly affected
communication success.
This pattern of results
supports models of dialogue that downplay the role of
high-level cognitive processes, and stress the
importance of behaviour alignment, via low-level
processes
such
as
priming,
to
successful
communication (Garrod & Pickering, 2004; Pickering &
Garrod, 2004). In the present study, although partner
feedback did not directly affect communication
success, it proved crucial to sign simplification and
symbolization, which improved the smooth and
efficient flow of communication (see also Bavelas et
al., 2000; Mein et al., 2016).
