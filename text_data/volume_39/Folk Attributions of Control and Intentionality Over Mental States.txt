Abstract
Influential theories in social psychology, philosophy, and
linguistics assume that ordinary people judge many mental
states as outside voluntary control, yet few studies have directly
investigated these claims. We report four studies suggesting
that, contrary to several prominent models, ordinary people
attribute at least moderate intentional control to others over a
wide variety of mental states. Furthermore, it appears that
perceived control may vary systematically according to mental
state type (e.g. emotions vs. desires vs. beliefs). These results
point to several important directions for future research in
behavior explanation and moral judgment.
Keywords: mental states; control; intentionality; agency

Introduction
Mental states are not just used to explain and predict others’
observable behavior, they are also often treated much like
behaviors themselves in that we talk about them, care about
them, and try to influence them (Frankfurt, 2004). For
instance, when we learn that someone doesn’t like us or
respect us, it hurts and we feel angry (Leary, Springer, Negel,
Ansell, & Evans, 1998). When we dislike certain attitudes,
either our own or someone else’s, we try to change them
(DeMarree, Wheeler, Briñol, & Petty, 2014). And when
we’re exposed to someone’s highly immoral emotions,
desires, and thoughts, we form negative impressions of that
person and try to avoid them (Ames & Johar, 2009; Gromet,
Goodwin, & Goodman, 2016; Cohen & Rozin, 2001).
Despite the importance of mental state evaluation and
regulation in social life, very little research has studied how
ordinary people think about others’ agency over their own
minds. This omission is particularly striking in light of years
of research demonstrating that perceptions of behavioral
control predict judgments of blame and responsibility,
feelings of anger or pity, and helping or punishing behavior
(see, Alicke, 2000; Malle, Guglielmo, & Monroe, 2014;
Weiner, 1995 for reviews).
One possible reason for this omission is a long-held
assumption, based on early work in linguistics, that mental
states are perceived as involuntary. In one of the first
investigations on this topic, Katz and Postal (1964) argued,
based on the observation that mental state verbs seem to be
ungrammatical in the imperative form (e.g. compare “Want
this pear!” and “Pick up this pear!”), that “being in such
psychological states as belief, understanding, wanting and
hoping is not subject to a person’s will” (p. 77; see also Miller
& Johnson-Laird, 1978). Despite other work arguing that
many mental states can be used in the imperative form (e.g.
Huddleston, 1970), many linguists continued to assume that

mental states are involuntary (e.g., Brown & Fish, 1983;
Corrigan, 1988).
This work also influenced social psychology. For instance,
Gilovich and Regan (1986) assumed that, unlike actions,
mental states “do not necessarily involve any choice on the
part of the person from among alternatives; they just happen”
(p. 349). Similarly, Malle and Knobe (1997a) took as given
that “prototypical actions… are both intentional and
observable, whereas prototypical experiences (e.g. ‘Ben is
excited’) are both unintentional and unobservable” (p. 289;
emphasis added). These claims about ordinary attributions of
intentionality and voluntariness play an important role in
psychological models of behavior explanation. For instance,
Malle & Knobe (1997a) argued that people will be less
motivated to try and explain others’ mental states because
they are unintentional. Gilovich & Regan (1986) argued that,
because mental states are involuntary and uncontrollable,
people offer more dispositional (as opposed to situational)
explanations for them (see also Lock & Pennington, 1982).
Finally, Malle (2004)’s model of behavior explanation posits
that people provide mechanistic cause explanations (as
opposed to reason explanations) for emotions, desires,
beliefs, and other mental states, on the premise that ordinary
people judge these as unintentional.
Scholars in philosophy and anthropology also frequently
make assumptions about ordinary people’s judgments of
mental state voluntarism, but they often differentiate between
mental states types. In his ‘folk model of mind’, D’Andrade
(1987) claimed, similarly to Katz and Postal (1964), that
people view desires as entirely involuntary and
uncontrollable. However, D’Andrade (1987) also claimed
that people view emotions as somewhat controllable and
beliefs as highly controllable. A similar pattern emerges in
philosophical theories. For instance, the idea that ordinary
people judge beliefs as voluntary is echoed in Alston (1988),
who invoked this point to explain why people blame each
other for unjustified beliefs, while the idea that people view
desires and other attitudes as involuntary is common in moral
philosophy (see, e.g. Adams, 1985; Smith, 2008).
Despite the ubiquity of claims about the perceived
controllability of mental states, only a handful of studies have
been conducted which directly ask people about how they
perceive them, and the evidence from these studies conflicts.
In one study, Malle and Knobe (1997b) asked participants to
rate the intentionality of 20 behaviors, three of which were
mental states (e.g. “Anne was in a great mood”). Each of
those mental states was rated low in intentionality (e.g. M =
2.54 on a 1-7 scale). In contrast, Schlesinger (1992) asked
people to rate how much control (Studies 1-4, 6) or

1842

intentionality (Study 5) the experiencer of a mental state had
over that state and found that people attributed a moderately
high degree of control and intentionality (e.g. M = 4.58 on a
1-7 scale, Study 6). However, Schlesinger (1992) relied on
scenarios that were interpersonal and highly abstract (e.g. “A
fears B”), making it unclear whether the results reflect
prototypical attributional processes.
In light of this, we sought to test how much control and
intentionality people typically attribute to others over their
mental states. We improved over prior studies by testing a
wide range of mental states and, following the possibility
raised by D’Andrade (1987) and others, testing for
differences between mental state categories. In the studies
below, we also include observable behaviors including
intentional acts (e.g. talk, avoid), accidents (e.g. slip, fall),
and uncontrollable behaviors (e.g. sneeze, shiver), as foils.
These foils acted as benchmarks, allowing us to test how
judgments of mental states compared with judgments of
prototypical controllable and uncontrollable behaviors, while
also ensuring that participants used the control measure
concepts in a predictable way.

Study 1
The purpose of Study 1 was to measure prototypical
judgments of control for a variety of mental states, and to
compare these judgments with those for clearly intentional,
unintentional, and uncontrollable behaviors. To obtain
ecologically valid materials, we solicited vignettes from one
sample of our population (University of Pennsylvania
undergraduates), selected frequent examples, and then used
them in a rating task for a separate sample from the same
population.

Methods
Stimulus generation and selection. We solicited stimuli for
43 items in total. These items consisted of 28 mental states,
including four beliefs (believe that, conclude that, feel that,
think that), four desires (crave, desire, hope, want), four
emotions (anger, anxiety, embarrassment, happiness), four
intentions (goal, intend, plan, resolve), four deliberations
(consider, deliberate, speculate, think about), four
evaluations (value, love, hate, appreciate), two imaginations
(imagine, visualize), and two memory events (forget,
remember). In addition to these 28 mental states, we included
five intentional acts (play with, eat, say, search for, avoid),
five accidents (fall off of, trip over, slip on, run into, drop),
and five uncontrollable behaviors (sneeze, yawn, sweat,
shiver, faint) as our foils.
80 University of Pennsylvania students participated (57
female) in a sentence completion task for course credit.
Participants were provided with sentence fragments
containing an ambiguous subject and a mental (or behavioral)
verb, but no object (e.g. "He believed that…", "She
wanted…", "He intended to…"). They were instructed to
complete each sentence fragment in a way that made sense
given the words provided and to avoid humor. The mental
states were split across five lists and combined with

observable behaviors and 12-13 filler trials. Participants were
randomly assigned to one of these lists, yielding 13-17
contents per item.
As expected, many of the topics participants wrote about
were relevant to their lives as undergraduate students,
including concerns about school (e.g. "She felt anxious about
her upcoming exam", "He planned to do better on the next
test"), romantic relationships (e.g. "She felt angry with her
boyfriend", "She thought that she wasn’t good enough for
him"), and food (e.g. "He craved chocolate", "She thought
about the lunch she would be having soon"). Similar
responses appeared across item categories.
We selected five completions for each of the 28 mental
states and 15 behavior foils, yielding 215 scenarios total,
based on the frequency of similar completions. For items that
produced few or no duplicate responses, we selected
responses so as to maximize the diversity of content.
Main rating task. 143 University of Pennsylvania students
(94 female) were recruited for an experiment about
“understanding others’ behavior” and completed the task for
course credit.
The 215 scenarios were distributed across five lists. Each
list contained one scenario from each of the 28 mental states
and 15 behaviors yielding 43 trials total. Scenarios were
presented on separate pages in a random order. For each trial
participants responded to eight questions which, to avoid
possible order effects, were presented in a new random order
for each trial.
Four questions assessed how much agency participants
attributed to the agent for the ascribed mental state. Two of
these questions assessed general control: (1) How much
control the agent had over that behavior; and (2) Whether, if
desired, the agent could have done otherwise. The other two
probed intentionality: (3) Whether the agent acted
intentionally; and (4) Whether the agent chose to
act/think/feel (etc.) that way.
Two questions probed participants’ evaluations of the
mental state, including (5) How good or bad the agent’s
behavior was; and (6) Whether the agent should have
behaved in the manner described. Two final questions probed
judgments of agent themselves: (7) How responsible the
agent was for the behavior or mental state; and (8) How
revealing it was of the agent. All questions used a 7-point
rating scale.
To minimize ambiguity, all questions contained explicit
reference to the mental or physical content (e.g., "How much
control did she have over believing that she did well on the
exam?”). At the end of the experiment, participants reported
demographic variables including age, sex, political
orientation, religiosity, and religious affiliation.

Results
We combined our two control (1-2, rs = 0.74 – 0.81), and two
intentionality (3-4, rs = 0.83 – 0.89) measures into single
measures of control and intentionality (Table 1 shows means
and standard deviations for each behavior and mental state

scenarios (color) from Study 1. Each shape represents the mean one of the five scenarios.
category). To test degrees of agency, we ran a series of
mixed-effect linear models comparing mental state categories
to uncontrolled, accidental, or intentional behaviors, on bysubject means for each category.
Participants used the control concepts expected: accidents
were seen as more controlled (b = 0.78, SE = 0.11, t = 7.26,
p < 0.001) but not more intentional (b = -0.15, SE = 0.11, t
= -1.39, p = 0. 165) than uncontrollable behaviors. With two
exceptions, mental states were seen as more controlled and
intentional than the uncontrollable and unintentional
behaviors (ps < 0.001). Only intentions were not see as less
controlled (p = 0.338) or intentional (p = 0.832) than
intentional action foils (see Figure 1).
We also conducted a set of exploratory analyses to test
whether any mental state categories were significantly
different from one another. We conducted a regression
comparing each mental state category to its adjacent category
based on the overall control and intentionality means. Results
showed that, on average, most mental state category ratings
were different from their adjacent category: emotions were
less intentional than desires (b = 0.79, SE = 0.08, t = 10.07, p

< 0.001), desires were less intentional than beliefs (b = 0.39,
SE = 0.08, t = 4.92, p < 0.001). Beliefs and evaluations were
not significantly different from each other (b = 0.11, SE =
0.08, t = 1.42, p = 0.157), however evaluations were different
from deliberations (b = 0.44, SE = 0.08, t = 5.58, p < 0.001).
This pattern was replicated in participants’ control ratings.
Finally, we examined item-level means for each of the 28
mental state concepts and found that judgments of control and
intentionality were highly correlated with one another (r(26)
= 0.95), and with judgments of responsibility (r(26) = 0.98
and r(26) = 0.92, respectively).

Discussion
Results from this study provide evidence that, contrary to the
theories cited above, many ordinary mental states are
perceived to be moderately controllable and intentional. It
also suggests that perceived agency might differ as a function
of the type of mental state: emotions were judged as less
voluntary than desires, beliefs, and other states.
However, this study has several notable shortcomings.
First, the mental state scenarios were presented without the
immediate context in which they occurred. It is possible that
when possible proximate or situational causes for mental
states are made salient, perceived control and choice is
diminished. Second, the nature of our design was such that
the content of the mental states was not held constant across
mental state type: desires tended to be “about” different
things than beliefs, evaluations, and so on. It is therefore
possible that differences in control were due to what the
mental states were about. Study 2 was designed to address
these limitations.

Study 2
Study 2 used a set of experimenter-generated stimuli to
investigate judgments of three different measures of

1844

voluntariness with more detailed and comparable vignettes.
Because control measures were divided between subjects,
Study 2 comprised three separate experiments: Study 2a
investigated judgments of intentional choice, Study 2b
investigated general control, and Study 2c investigated the
ability to choose to stop thinking, feeling, or wanting
something once it has started.
We predicted that, despite the additional constraints
imposed in this experiment (see below), participants would
still view mental states as moderately voluntary – more
controllable than passive behaviors such as coughing or
sweating – but not as fully controllable as intentional actions
and, second, that there would be a step-wise increase in
perceived control between emotions, desires, beliefs, and
thoughts.

As this example illustrates, the context prior to the
manipulation was held constant, and the attitudinal content of
each mental state (and the intentional behavior) was also held
as constant as possible (e.g., in the item above, a negative and
retaliatory attitude towards the professor is conveyed in each
case). There was, of course, no such content for the
uncontrollable foils (shivering, sneezing, coughing, etc.). We
varied the kind of emotion experienced by the agent in the
scenario: across the 30 sets, the emotion condition featured
the agent feeling either angry, sad, afraid, excited, or pleased.
Given 30 scenarios, each of which split into six behavior
conditions, there were 180 items in the whole experiment.
Design. The items were distributed across six lists (of 30
items each) using a Latin-square design. Each list had one
item category from each of the 30 scenarios, yielding a total
of five trials within each list for each item category. We
balanced the distribution of emotion trials so that each of the
five different emotions appeared in each list.

Methods
Participants. A total of 442 participants were recruited from
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to participate in Study 2. 146
individuals (65 female, 81 male; mean age = 35) participated
in Study 2a (“Choice”), 149 (66 Female, 78 Male, 5
unreported; mean age = 34) participated in 2b (“Control”),
and the remaining 147 (60 Female, 85 Male, 2 unreported;
mean age = 35) participated in 2c (“Choose to stop”). No
participants were excluded.
Stimuli. To generate contexts, we constructed 30 scenarios
describing someone in an ordinary or believable situation
(such as repairing a bike, photographing a wedding, walking
down the street, and so on). Unlike Study 1, each scenario
provided a great deal of context about the person and
situation leading up to the mental state or behavior. Our
primary manipulation was the last element of each scenario,
which was either (1) an observable uncontrollable reaction,
(2) an emotion, (3) a desire, (4) a belief, (5) thinking or
ruminating on some idea, or (6) an observable intentional
action. Below is one of the 30 scenarios with each of the six
conditions:
Katy is nearing the end of her third year in college. She's
studying chemistry and biology in order to eventually apply
to medical school. Any low grade will hurt her chances at
getting into the top medical schools. Today, however, she
struggled through the final exam in her chemistry class.
She did not complete it in time and had to guess on the
entire last page of questions.
Walking out of the exam, Katy…
1. begins shivering in the cold. (uncontrollable reaction)
2. feels angry at her professor. (emotion)
3. wants to leave her professor a poor course evaluation.
(desire)
4. believes that her professor deserves a poor course
evaluation. (belief)
5. thinks about leaving her professor a poor course
evaluation. (thinking)
6. fills out a negative course evaluation on her phone.
(intentional act)

Dependent measures. In Study 2a, the main dependent
variable was whether the agent chose the particular mental
state he/she had at the end of the story. Participants indicated
their answer on a rating scale ranging from 1 (definitely did
not choose) to 7 (definitely did choose). As in Study 1, the
full content of each item was included in each question and
was italicized (e.g. “Did Katy choose to feel angry at her
professor?”).
Study 2b measured perceptions of how much control the
agent had over whether he/she had the particular mental
state (or over the behavior). For instance, in the Katy vignette
above, participants were asked “How much control did Katy
have over whether she felt angry at her professor?” on a scale
from 1 (no control at all) to 7 (complete control).
Finally, 2c, measured perceptions of the degree to which
the agent could stop the particular mental state (or behavior)
once it had started. In the Katy vignette above, participants
were asked “Can Katy choose to stop feeling angry at her
professor?” on a scale from 1 (definitely can not choose) to 7
(definitely can choose).
Procedure. At the beginning of the experiment participants
were randomly assigned to one of the six stimulus lists.
Participants were provided brief instructions that they would
read 30 stories about different characters and answer a
question about a behavior that the character performed. Each
trial was presented on a separate page in a new random order
for each participant. At the end of the study, participants
filled out a brief demographics questionnaire. No other data
was collected.

Results
All analyses were performed by running a linear mixed-effect
model (LMEM) regressing ratings on the within-subject,
within-scenario behavior manipulation. We included random
intercepts for participant and scenario ratings, as well as

random slopes for by-subject and by-scenario variation in the
effect of condition. For each control measure, Intentionality,
Control, and Stopping, we ran three sets of analyses. One
analysis compared the means of the four mental state
categories to the uncontrollable behavior foil (dummy coded
as the reference level); one analysis compared the means of
the four mental state categories to the intentional act behavior
foil; and finally one analysis compared mental state
categories to each other following our hypothesized stepwise increase in control through emotions, desires, beliefs,
and thinking. See Figure 2 for condition means and standard
error across control measures.
2a: Choice. Replicating results from Study 1, emotions (M =
3.95, SD = 2.08), desires (M = 5.48, SD = 2.08), beliefs (M
= 5.43, SD = 1.73), and thinking (M = 5.29, SD = 1.77) were
all judged significantly more intentional than uncontrollable
reactions (M = 1.67, SD = 1.37; ps < 0.001). These states
were also all judged significantly less chosen than intentional
acts (M = 6.45, SD = 1.13; ps < 0.001). Also replicating Study
1, emotions were rated as less chosen than desires (b = 1.534,
SE = 0.08, t = 19.243, p < 0.001) but, contrary to
expectations, there were no differences between desires and
beliefs or beliefs and thinking (ps > 0.07).
2b: Control. Emotions (M = 4.26, SD = 1.44), desires (M =
4.96, SD = 1.85), beliefs (M = 5.09, SD = 1.72), and thinking
(M = 5.00, SD = 1.81) were all judged significantly more
controllable than uncontrollable reactions (M = 2.09, SD =
1.44; ps < 0.001) and significantly less controllable than
intentional acts (M = 6.32, SD = 1.23; ps < 0.001). Similar to
Study 2a, we observed a significant difference between
emotions and desires (b = 0.692, SE = 0.076, t = 9.125, p <
0.001), but not between desires, beliefs, or thinking (ps >
0.07).
2c: Choosing to Stop. Again, Emotions (M = 4.44, SD =
1.99), desires (M = 4.74, SD = 1.98), beliefs (M = 4.77, SD =
1.93), and thinking (M = 5.08, SD = 1.84) were all judged
significantly easier to stop than uncontrollable reactions (M

= 2.03, SD = 1.58; ps < 0.001) and significantly harder to stop
than intentional acts (M = 6.08, SD = 1.54; ps < 0.001).
Participants judged emotions as more difficult to stop than
desires (b = 0.306, SE = 0.084, t = 3.662, p < 0.001), and
beliefs more difficult to stop than thinking (b = 0.305, SE =
0.084, t = 3.638, p < 0.001) but did not distinguish between
beliefs and desires (b = 0.03, SE = 0.084, t = 0.359, p = 0.72).
Discussion
Study 2 replicated the main findings from Study 1: people
attribute moderate to high agency to others over their
emotions, desires, beliefs, and deliberative thoughts, whether
that agency is conceptualized as “choice”, general “control”,
or an ability to “choose to stop”. This finding replicated in
spite of more explicit portrayals of relevant situational
constraints. We also replicated the finding that this control is
not perceived as complete: individuals were granted less
agency over all mental states (even traditionally “active”
processes such as thinking) compared to observable
intentional acts.
We also found that emotions were perceived as less
voluntary than desires. Unexpectedly, once holding mental
state content constant, the other differences in perceived
agency, namely, those between desires and beliefs, and
between beliefs and thinking, did not replicate except in the
“choose to stop” condition. This may reflect the improved
design in this study (i.e., the fact that background context and
focal content were held constant), but suggests that some
variation in general control may come from the kinds of
content different mental states are usually about.

General Discussion
Our results pose a challenge to a common assumption in
linguistics, anthropology, and social psychology, namely that
people view others’ mental states as largely uncontrollable.
Contrary to this assumption, we report that people judge
many mental states to be quite controllable: they clearly do
not perceive mental states as just happening (cf. Gilovich &
Regan, 1986), completely outside voluntary control (cf. Katz

1846

& Postal, 1964), nor as uniformly unintentional (cf. Malle &
Knobe, 1997a).
In line with models like those proposed by D’Andrade
(1987), our results also suggest that people attribute different
degrees of voluntary control to different mental state
categories (even holding context and content constant).
However, as D’Andrade (1987) never empirically tested his
model, his specific predictions were wrong: for instance, we
found that people viewed desires as moderately controllable,
more controllable, on average, than emotions, whereas
D’Andrade (1987) posited that desires were uncontrollable
(while emotions were partially controllable). Future work
should investigate the sources of variation in control both
between (e.g. why beliefs easier are to control than
emotions), and within mental state categories (e.g., why
particular beliefs differ in their perceived controllability).
Finally, a great deal of work has shown that people are held
accountable for their moral wrongs (e.g. Alicke, 2000; Malle
et al, 2014). To date, however, notwithstanding some related
work inferring poor character from knowledge of noxious
mental states (see, e.g. Ames & Johar, 2009; Gromet et al.,
2016), no one has investigated the possibility that people hold
each other accountable (i.e., blameworthy) for their immoral
beliefs, desires, or emotions. Given that people apparently do
attribute agency to others over everyday mental states, and
control predicted judgments of responsibility in Study 1,
future work should investigate whether these results replicate
for immoral mental states, and whether perceived agency
predicts blame, anger, and punishment.
To conclude: assumptions about the perceived agency of
mental states are common, yet direct empirical investigations
are rare. Across several studies, we found that these
assumptions fail to track ordinary judgments of the
controllability of mental states. Accordingly, our results may
have important implications for a range of debates in social
and cognitive psychology, and open up new questions about
the sources of variation in perceptions of mental control.
