   The schema induction account assumes that analogical
comparison abstracts one’s stimulus representation, i.e.,
relational commonalities are highlighted, and mismatches of
features are ignored. To further test this account it is
important to examine the representation formed from the
comparison independently from the test of retrieval. Gentner
et al. (Experiment 1; 2009) used a post-retrieval transfer
task to confirm participant representations, but scoring was
based on how well participants’ descriptions matched a
target schema, not directly analyzing the schema used by the
participants. Hofstadter’s (1995) letter-string proportional

                   them again. There was only a typo in the word ‘Elash’, so only the
                   letter ‘E’ was changed from the letter ‘E’, to the letter ‘F’, correcting
                   the word ‘Elash’ to ‘Flash’.

Transfer response
   Responses were coded through the schema they
presumably expressed. As in Burns (1996), letter-string
responses generated by two or fewer participants were
collapsed into the category Other. Figure 4 shows the
structural hierarchy of the three prototypical responses to
the letter-string analogy task. Participant response of
DSSNNN was considered a Surface response, since it only
takes into account the C changing into D. Participant
responses of CSSOOO, CSSNNO, CSTNNO were collapsed
into category First-order, since they all use the first-order
principle of succession. Participant response of CSSNNNN
was considered Higher-order, since it takes into the higher-
order correspondence of numerical representation. Table 3
shows the frequencies of these responses for each schema
condition.
   A chi-square test was conducted of letter-string response
by schema condition. Letter-string response had four levels:
surface, first-order, higher-order, and other. Schema
condition had three levels: surface schema, first-order

longer delay between source story encoding and the
retrieval phase. Further, it is not clear what exact role the
explicit principle played in cuing the source stories. In
general, it seems that explicit principles are not sufficient to
induce a schema, but do seem to facilitate induction. Thus,
future replications should systematically manipulate the
explicit principle and its inclusion with comparison to
determine its role as a retrieval cue for the far analogical
retrieval.
  Relational priming is sometimes used to explain
analogical retrieval effects (Holyoak, 2012). It is unlikely to
explain all of the present retrieval results because most
relational priming effects are demonstrated using individual
word pairs of highly familiar relations. There is little
evidence to suggest that a higher-order relation can be
primed in the same way, and the participants in our study
had little to no previous experience with the specific
