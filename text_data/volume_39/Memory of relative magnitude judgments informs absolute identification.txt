Memory of relative magnitude judgments informs absolute identification

Abstract: The question of whether people store absolute magnitude information or relative local comparisons of magnitudes
has remained unanswered despite persistent efforts over the last three decades to resolve it. Absolute identification is one of the
most rigorous experimental benchmarks for evaluating theories of magnitude representation. We characterize difficulties with
both absolute and relative accounts of magnitude representation and propose an alternative account that potentially resolves
these difficulties. We postulate that people store neither long-term internal referents for stimuli, not binary comparisons of
size between successive stimuli. Rather, they obtain probabilistic judgments of size differences between successive stimuli
and encode these for future use, within the course of identification trials. We set up a Bayesian ideal observer model for the
identification task using this representation of magnitude and propose a memory-sampling based approximation for solving it.
Simulations suggest that the model adequately captures human behavior patterns in absolute identification.
