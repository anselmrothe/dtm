Results and Discussion
Because the study was conducted online without
experimenter supervision, we first inspected the data in order
to identify potential compliance issues. For each participant,
we calculated the median response time during both study
phases. The sample’s median response time to complete the
study phase was 10.5 seconds per problem (max: 22.9
sec./problem; min: 0.73 sec./problem). We calculated the
10th and the 90th percentiles for the distribution of median
response times, 3.3 sec./problem and 16 sec./problem
respectively, and used these values as a measure of non-
compliance in the task. Responding too fast (faster than the
10th percentile) is likely due to participants who are not           Figure 1: Results for the Test Phase of Experiment 1. Dotted lines
