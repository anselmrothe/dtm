Abstract

(Carvalho & Goldstone, 2014). The Sequential Attention
Theory (Carvalho & Goldstone, 2015), proposes a
mechanism through which attention and encoding during
blocked study are progressively directed towards the
similarities among successive items belonging to the same
category whereas attention and encoding during interleaved
study are progressively directed towards the differences
between successive items belonging to different categories.
Because of this influence on cognitive processing, Carvalho
and Goldstone (2015) propose that the sequence of study can
accelerate or delay learning, depending on whether the
constraints created by the sequence of study match those of
the encoding situation (e.g., interleaved study in situations
critically hinging on the encoding of differences between
concepts, such as the study of highly similar concepts), or
mismatch it (e.g., blocked study in the same situations).
In this work, we aim to extend these results to demonstrate
that different encoding experiences will result in different
representations that will be more or less appropriate
depending on the requirements of the testing situation. Our
proposal is as follows: because different information is
encoded with different sequences of study, different
sequences of study potentiate different representations of
what was studied. More specifically, encoding the
differences between concepts through interleaved study will
tend to lead to the creation of interrelated concepts whose
representations are contrasted away from each other by
emphasizing or exaggerating their distinctive characteristic
relative to each other (Corneille et al., 2006; Goldstone,
1996). Conversely, blocking will tend to lead to encodings of
the similarities within each concept that will, in turn, create
relatively isolated, stand-alone, representations (Goldstone,
1996).
These different representations, once created, are suited for
different uses. Although an interrelated representation of two
concepts will be helpful in a new context in which
discriminating the previously learned concepts is important,
isolated representations of the same concepts may not be as
useful. Conversely, an isolated representation of a concept
will include more information about all the properties of that
concept, whether or not they serve to distinguish it from the
other learned concepts, making it ideal for situations in which
these details are relevant, such as when the concept must be
differentiated from other new concepts possessing new
distinctive features.
Students often create flashcards as a study and self-testing
tool (Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012). These flashcards might

Previous research has shown that the sequence in which
concepts are studied changes how well they are learned. In a
series of experiments featuring naturalistic concepts
(psychology concepts) and naïve learners, we extend previous
research by showing that the sequence of study changes the
representation the learner creates of the study materials.
Interleaved study leads to the creation of relatively interrelated
concepts that are represented by contrast to each other and
based on discriminating properties. Blocked study, instead,
leads to the creation of relatively isolated concepts that are
represented in terms of their central and characteristic
properties. The relative benefits of these representations
depend on whether the test of conceptual knowledge requires
contrastive or characteristic information. These results argue
for the integrated investigation of the benefits of different
sequences of study as depending on the characteristics of the
study and testing situation as a whole.

Introduction
The sequence of study while learning concepts changes what
is learned and how well it is learned. Therefore, it is perhaps
not surprising that understanding how students should
organize their study to promote learning has emerged as a
major area of active interest in educational and cognitive
science research. Previous research has focused on how
different sequences might improve learning (Birnbaum et al.,
2013), and how the benefits of different sequences might
interact with different study conditions (Carvalho &
Goldstone, 2015), materials (Carvalho & Goldstone, 2014),
individual characteristics (Sana et al., 2016), or selfregulation (Carvalho et al., 2016).
When hard-to-discriminate concepts are studied in an
interleaved fashion, by alternating the study of the different
concepts, learning is improved compared to when different
concepts are studied in separate blocks (Kornell & Bjork,
2008). However, the benefit of interleaved study is not
universal. For example, it has been shown that when studying
concepts that have high within-category diversity in their
properties (for example, the category mammal which
includes bats, cows, and whales), studying each concept in
separate blocks can result in better learning (Carvalho &
Goldstone, 2014). This apparent inconsistency lead to the
proposal that different sequences of study emphasize
different properties of the studied materials and thus might be
more appropriate for different types of concept learning tasks

include a definition or an example of a concept on one side
of the card and the correct response on the other. When
studying using examples, students might choose to study all
the cards from one concept in a block or to interleave cards
from different concepts. One important question, then, is if
different sequences of examples will influence students’
performance for different types of tests – a question that, to
the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed before.
This is not only an important question at the theoretical level
– to know the representational differences created by
different sequences – but also at the practical level because
changing the sequence of study materials is an easy and cheap
intervention that might have substantial influences on
learning outcomes (Dunlosky et al., 2013). In fact, previous
researchers have emphatically advocated presenting
information interleaved whenever possible, warning students
about the perils of blocked study (e.g., Bjork, Dunlosky, &
Kornell, 2013), and it has been suggested as an important
factor of which all new instructors should be aware (Deans
for Impact, 2015).
For this purpose, we developed two experiments in which
learners studied concepts of psychology (e.g., “Hindsight
bias”; Rawson et al., 2015) in one of the sequences and were
then tested in different situations, similar to common study
practices by students. Importantly, some of the tests required
discrimination between different concepts (e.g., multiplechoice test), whereas others required an independent
representation of each concept (e.g., writing a definition). We
consider writing a definition to require an independent
representation because these definitions can be expressed
without referring to other learned concepts. For example, a
participant could write a definition for “availability heuristic”
without having learned or remembered any of the other
presented concepts (Goldstone, 1996). We predict that for
tests that emphasize isolated, independent knowledge of the
properties of each concept, such as writing a definition,
participants will perform better following blocked study.
Conversely, for tests that require discriminating different
concepts, i.e., those that involve choosing between several
options, participants will perform better with interleaved
study.

issues (see below for details). The demographic
characteristics of participants in the overall sample are
presented in Table 1.
Stimuli. We used a stimulus set of introductory concepts and
examples created by Rawson et al. (2015). The stimuli
included 10 concepts taught in Introductory Psychology and
10 example situations for each concept, collected from
textbooks of Introductory Psychology. The concepts were
divided into two groups by relatedness. Each group contained
unrelated concepts only, whereas across groups pairs of
related concepts existed (see Table 2). Relatedness of the
concepts was judged by the authors by comparing the
definitions of the concepts and confirmed by analyzing the
pattern of errors in multiple-choice questions without
feedback in a pilot study. Previous research looking at
sequence of study using these materials used this concept
grouping as well (Rawson et al., 2015).

Design and Procedure. This Experiment had two conditions
manipulated within-subject: Study Sequence (Blocked vs.
Interleaved) and Type of Test (Multiple-Choice Test vs.
Definition Match Test vs. Write Definitions Test).
The experiment had three phases: pretest, study and test.
Participants completed one pretest, two study phases and two
tests phases in the following order: Pretest – Study 1 – Test 1
– Study 2 – Test 2. The first and second study phases were
the same in every aspect except for the sequence of study and
the concepts studied. One study phase was interleaved and
the other blocked (order counterbalanced across
participants). A different group of to-be-learned concepts was
used in each study phase. In the interleaved condition learners
studied an example of each concept before studying the same
concept again (e.g., ABCABC…). Conversely, in the blocked
condition learners studied all examples of each concept
before starting a new concept (e.g., AABBCC…). Moreover,
the test phase only tested the concepts learned in the
immediately preceding study phase. Between each study and
test phase participants completed a distractor task by
watching a 4-minute video on an unrelated topic and
answering a question about that video.
During the pretest phase participants were told that they
would be presented with several psychology concepts that

knowing the concepts was not an issue for the study, would
not impact their eligibility or payment, and that they should
be honest in their responses. On each trial, the name of a
concept was presented and participants had to rate on a scale
from 1 (“Not familiar at all”) to 7 (“Very familiar”) how
familiar they were with that concept. Following each rating,
participants were asked to provide an example of that
concept, or enter “I don’t know” if they did not know any.
Participants completed the pretest for the ten to-be-studied
concepts across both study phases.
Following the completion of the pretest, participants
completed the study phase. During the study phase,
participants studied examples of situations depicting each of
five concepts, one at a time and were asked to choose the
name of the concept they thought the example instantiated.
Participants were given feedback after each response. During
study, participants studied five examples of each of the five
concepts.
During the test phase, participants completed three types of
tests: Multiple-Choice, Writing Definitions and Match
Definitions, always in that order. The Multiple-Choice test
used the same procedure as the study phase with new
examples and without feedback. In the Writing Definitions,
test participants were shown the name of each of the concepts
studied one at a time and asked to write the best definition
possible for that concept, based on what they had learned in
the previous study phase. In the Match Definitions test
participants were presented with the textbook definition of
each concept, one a time, and asked to identify what concept
that definition belonged to by pressing the corresponding
button on the screen. The order of trials within each of the
tests was randomized across participants. None of the test
phase tasks had any time limit.

Pretest. To analyze the data from the pretest we calculated
25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the ratings (see Table 3).
As can be seen, most participants showed little or no
knowledge of the to-be-studied concepts (mean of
approximately 2 in a 1-7 scale). The provided examples
further confirmed this interpretation.

Study Phase. Mean performance during the blocked study
phase was 72% (SEM = 5%), whereas during interleaved
study it was 67% (SEM = 5%). This difference was not
statistically significant, F (1,20) = 1.95, p =.169, ŋ2G = .012.
Test Phase. Two trained coders, blind to condition
assignment, rated as correct or incorrect each of the written
definitions. These two coders agreed 87% of the time and
inter-coder reliability was high, Cohen’s Kappa = .725, p <
.0001. Disagreements were resolved by a third coder, also
blind to condition assignment of the responses.
Performance for the test phase is depicted in Figure 1. As
can be seen in the figure, the type of tests varied in their level
of difficulty, with participants performing better in the
Definitions Match test and worse in the Write Definitions
test, F (2,42) = 17.62, p = < .0001, ŋ2G = 0.151. Although
there was no overall main effect of study sequence F (2,42)
= 1.36, p = .256, ŋ2G= .006, there was a significant interaction
between type of test and study sequence, F (2, 42) = 5.26, p
= .022, ŋ2G = .022.

Results and Discussion
Because the study was conducted online without
experimenter supervision, we first inspected the data in order
to identify potential compliance issues. For each participant,
we calculated the median response time during both study
phases. The sample’s median response time to complete the
study phase was 10.5 seconds per problem (max: 22.9
sec./problem; min: 0.73 sec./problem). We calculated the
10th and the 90th percentiles for the distribution of median
response times, 3.3 sec./problem and 16 sec./problem
respectively, and used these values as a measure of noncompliance in the task. Responding too fast (faster than the
10th percentile) is likely due to participants who are not
reading the problems and just advancing through the
experiment quickly; similarly, longer response times (above
that of the 90th percentile) are likely due to potentially
distracted participants. Six participants were identified based
on this analysis and their data were excluded from further
analyses.
All the analyses below are ANCOVA analyses including
average pretest score and counterbalancing condition as
covariates.

mean.

To further investigate this interaction, we compared the
effect of type of study sequence on each of the tests by
calculating the difference in performance following blocked
and interleaved study for each type of test (interleaved –
blocked). The difference in performance between the two
conditions varied across type of test, F (2, 42) = 5.10, p =
.011, ŋ2G = .110. Planned contrasts using FDR correction
indicate that the effect of study sequence was significantly

200

different when comparing the Write Definitions test (M = .15, SEM = .06) with the Multiple-Choice test (M = .009,
SEM = .03), p = .033, and the Match Definitions test (M =
.02, SEM = .05), p = .040, but not when comparing the
Multiple Choice and the Match Definitions tests, p = .844.
These results are consistent with our proposal that blocked
study encourages learners to develop independent, standalone representations rather than highlighting diagnostic
features (i.e., those that discriminate between the concepts).
Interleaved study emphasizes features that discriminate
between concepts, which would be more helpful for a
subsequent categorization task than a task that requires
generation of stand-alone definition of the concept.

differences between concepts, whereas these differences
would not be likely to be highlighted in the previous
experiment.
In sum, when similar items are studied in the same session,
there are several reasons to believe that performance would
benefit from interleaved study, even when the test requires
learners to write definitions. However, when similar items are
studied in separate sessions, as in Experiment 1, blocked
study would promote best performance in a test requiring
isolated representations, such as writing definitions.
To test this, we used a procedure similar to how students
often organize their study. In most natural situations students
are likely to randomly assign the topics to be studied to a
study session or to follow the sequence of their textbook or
instructor. Therefore, in this experiment we randomly
assigned concepts to being studied either interleaved or
blocked, instead of using different pre-defined groups of
concepts that guarantee low between-category overlap as in
the previous experiment. This results in a situation where
similar concepts might be studied together or separately. We
compare performance on multiple-choice and writing
definitions tests following blocked or interleaved study in
each one of these situations.

Experiment 2
Our main proposal in this paper is that blocked study creates
relatively independent representations of each concept
studied which emphasizes the concept’s characteristic
features. These independent representations include more
details from each concept than what is fostered by the
relatively interrelated representations created during
interleaved study. In the context of studying examples of
different concepts, we proposed that blocked study allows
learners to more successfully write definitions of the concepts
because a definition requires the type of knowledge that
blocked study promotes; it is generally possible to write good
definitions for the learned psychology concepts without
mentioning other psychology concepts learned at the same
time. Consistent with this hypothesis, Experiment 1 showed
that following blocked rather than interleaved study, learners
were more successful at writing definitions of concepts, but
the groups did not differ on classifying examples.
However, when two concepts are highly related (e.g., footin-the-door and door-in-the-face technique) their definitions
can be aptly construed in relation to each other. If they are
studied together, one central feature to include in the
definition is the feature that discriminates them. Thus, the fact
that in the previous experiments learners studied in the same
session concepts that were dissimilar from each other and
varied in many properties (see Table 2) might have
contributed to the pattern of results seen. Would studying
similar concepts together change the pattern of results
observed?
Studying related concepts together changes the learning
task in at least three critical ways. First, studying similar
concepts in the same session might result in the necessity to
discriminate between similar situations in order to find the
subtle differences between the two types of concepts. It has
been shown before that the interrelated representations
promoted by interleaved study are likely to improve learning
in these situations of learning highly similar concepts
(Carvalho & Goldstone, 2014). Second, the features that
discriminate these related concepts are also characteristic
features of the concept, unlike what is the case when the
concepts are dissimilar (see Table 2). This means that
interleaved study could promote representations appropriate
for a writing definitions test through identification of

Method
Participants. A group of 36 people completed the
experiment following recruitment through Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk (https://www.mturk.com/). Data from 3
participants were excluded due to self-reported previous
participation in another study with the same materials. Data
from an additional 8 participants were excluded from
analyses because of possible compliance issues (see below
for details). The final sample included 25 participants. Table
1 includes the demographic characteristics of participants in
the overall sample.
Stimuli and Procedure. In this experiment, we used the
same set of materials as in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2,
but concepts were randomly assigned to be studied
interleaved or blocked. Thus, in this experiment we did not
force related concepts to be studied in separate phases.
The procedure was similar to the procedure used in
Experiment 1 except for the following differences.
Participants studied only eight concepts, four interleaved and
four blocked. During study, participants saw four situations
depicting each one of the concepts. After study, participants
played a game of Tetris for 30 seconds.
The test phase included only a multiple-choice test and a
writing definitions test, always presented in that order.
During the multiple-choice test participants saw a total of
four novel examples of the concepts studied, presented one at
a time, and were asked to indicate which concept it
illustrated.

Results and Discussion
We identified potentially non-compliant participants using
the participants’ response times during study. The sample’s
median response time to complete the study phase was 8.4

201

seconds per problem (max: 22.8 sec./problem; min: 0.47
sec./problem). The 10th and 90th percentiles for the
distribution of median response times were 2.6 sec./problem
and 16 sec./problem respectively. Eight participants were
identified as outliers based on their falling outside of this
range and their data were excluded from further analyses.
In all the analyses presented below, mean pretest score and
counterbalancing condition were included as covariates.
Pretest. As in the previous experiments, participants showed
little to no pre-training knowledge of the to-be-studied
concepts (see Table 3).
Study Phase. Mean performance during the blocked study
phase was 79% (SEM = 2.5%), while during interleaved
study it was 73% (SEM = 4%). However, this difference was
not statistically significant, F (1,25) = 2.65, p = .116, ŋ2G =
0.04.

As we saw in the previous experiments, overall learners
performed better on the Multiple-Choice test than when
writing definitions, Wald F (1, 33.842) = 91.68, p < .0001.
Similarly, the sequence of study had no overall effect on
performance, Wald F (1, 33.948) < 1. No interaction was
found between these two variables, Wald F (1,92.007) < 1.
However, the relatedness between concepts presented in
the same sequence influenced performance. Overall, when
participants studied the two related concepts in the same
sequence their performance was lower (M = 46.52%, SEM =
1.50%) than when related concepts were not in the same
sequence (M = 62.41%, SEM = 1.04%), Wald F (1, 24.284)
= 15.60, p = .0006. Item relatedness also interacted with
sequence of study and type of test, Wald F (1, 98.522) = 6.83,
p = .010.
To further analyze this interaction, we explored the test
results for each type of test separately. For the MultipleChoice test, only the effect of relatedness reached statistical
significance, Wald F (1, 24.264) = 9.43, p = .005. However,
for the Writing Definitions test, in addition to a significant
effect of item relatedness, Wald F (1, 25.649) = 9.81, p =
.004, we also found a significant interaction between item
relatedness and sequence of study, Wald F (1, 29.282) = 6.71,
p = .015 (see right panel of Figure 5). As predicted by the
results of Carvalho and Goldstone (2014), the relative
relatedness between items modulates the relative benefit of
each sequence for the Writing Definitions test. Moreover,
consistent with the results of Experiment 1, we see that when
similar items are not studied in the same sequence,
performance in the Write Definitions test benefits from
blocked study, although this effect was only marginally
significant, t (35) = 1.90, p = .066, d = 0.317.

Test Phase. Two trained coders, blind to condition
assignment, rated as correct or incorrect each of the Written
Definitions provided. The two coders agreed 84% of the time
and inter-coder reliability was high, Cohen’s Kappa = .611, p
< .0001. Disagreements were resolved by a third coder, also
blind to the condition assignment of the responses.
To analyze the results from the two tests used in this
experiment we classified each concept based on whether it
had been studied blocked or interleaved and whether its
related concept (see Table 2) had been studied in the same
sequence or in different sequences. When both related
concepts were studied in the same phase and in the same
sequence (e.g., “foot-in-the-door technique”, “door-in-theface technique” studied blocked), they were both classified as
“Blocked” and “Same Sequence.” However, when only one
of the related concepts was studied, or the two related
concepts were studied in different phases/sequences, both
were marked “Different Sequences.”
This classification of the concepts resulted in empty cells
for participants who did not have both concepts studied in the
Same Sequence and concepts studied in Different Sequences
for both interleaved and blocked study. Because traditional
repeated-measures ANOVA does not allow for the existence
of empty cells and we wanted to maximize the inclusion of
all data collected, here we used mixed model analyses and
report Wald F tests and respective p-values using KenwardRoger’s approximation (Kenward & Roger, 1997). The
results are depicted in Figure 2.

General Discussion
Overall, the results presented here show that the different
sequences of study affect performance differently for
different types of test. Studying examples of different
concepts in a blocked sequence improves performance in a
test requiring learners to provide a definition of the concept
studied, whereas for other tests there is no difference in
performance between the two sequences of study.
Consistently with previous research, we have argued that
this pattern of results is related to the acquisition of different
knowledge with each sequence. Whereas blocked study
results in the creation of a relatively isolated representations
(i.e., a stand-alone, independent representation of each
concept), interleaved study results in interrelated
representations (i.e., focusing on how a concept differs from
other(s) studied at the same time; Corneille et al., 2006;
Goldstone, 1996). Going one step further, these different
representations are likely to be the result of differences in the
underlying attentional and encoding processes (Carvalho &
Goldstone 2015). The information attended to and encoded
during study will dictate what type of representation is
brought to a new situation and therefore what is available at
test.

Moreover, we also saw that the effect of study sequence is
modulated by whether discrimination based on subtle
differences is necessary or not during study or test, such as is
the case with the related concepts presented together in
Experiment 2. We argued that this is the result of the
pressures of the study and testing situation: when studying
related concepts, interleaved study (and the interrelated
representations it promotes) helps learners determine what
discriminates between closely related concepts. This
interpretation is consistent with the results of Carvalho and
Goldstone (2014) showing that when learners studied similar
categories, interleaved study improved learning, whereas
when studying dissimilar categories, blocked study improved
learning. Although the sample sizes used in the studies
reported here might seem small, it is important to note that all
critical comparisons were within-subject manipulations
which increases the analytic power and that the effect sizes
reported here are large and in line with previous similar
research.
In sum, the two main contributions of the present work are
as follow; first, it goes beyond existing demonstrations that
blocking is better/worse than interleaving by showing how
sequence affects what is learned by creating different
representations given the same content. Second, it provides
evidence for the context-dependent nature of learning and
how the benefits of each sequence depend on the learning
situation. This evidence adds to previous demonstrations that
the best sequence of study depends on the type of material
being studied (Carvalho & Goldstone, 2014; Patel et al.,
2016), the type of study task (Carvalho & Goldstone, 2015;
Rawson et al., 2015), and whether students actively decide
how to organize their study (Carvalho et al., 2016). These
results also show the importance of developing theories of
why one intervention is better than another. We have
proposed a theory based on the similarities of the materials
being learned and the nature of the task. When concepts are
similar to each other, learners prioritize learning
discriminating features. Writing definitions generally
benefits from stand-alone representations unless the concepts
being defined are similar to each other and benefit by being
contrasted. The study of how an intervention interacts with
the learning situation, we would argue, has the potential to
not only provide a fuller understanding of how learning takes
place, but also provide richer, more precise,
recommendations for practice (Jonassen, 1982).
