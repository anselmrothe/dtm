   Analogical and causal reasoning theories both seek to explain        Inference and Similarity
   patterns of inductive inference. Researchers have claimed that
   reasoning scenarios incorporating aspects of both analogical         Similarity plays an important role in SMT. While simple

   2008). This paper takes an opposing position, arguing that fea-
   tures of analogical models make correct claims about infer-          central to the content of analogical inferences (Gentner &
   ence patterns found among causal analogies, including analo-         Markman, 1997). Relational similarity is assessed by a pro-

   higher-order relations are not guided by the transfer of prob-
   abilistic information about a cause from base to target. We          higher-order constraining relations govern lower-order rela-

The current paper challenges recent claims that standard the-
ories of analogy (such as structure-mapping theory; Gentner,
1983, 1989) cannot explain analogical inferences that incor-
porate causal relations. Holyoak and colleagues (Holyoak et
al., 2010; Lee & Holyoak, 2008) contend that causal analo-
gies require a different kind of process from typical analo-
gies. Specifically, they claim that structure-mapping the-
ory (SMT)—and more broadly, all extant models of anal-
ogy—fail to predict people’s inferences for causal analogies
that involve both generative and preventative causal relations.
In their view, causal analogies require models of analogy
that incorporate the basic elements of causal models (Lee &
Holyoak, 2008).
   We maintain that in causal analogies, the mapping between
analogs is done by the same structure-mapping processes as
in other domains. Assuming that the mapping yields can-
didate inferences in the target, normal causal reasoning pro-
cesses then occur in the target to arrive at further conclusions.       Figure 1: The causal systems in Lee & Holyoak (2008). G
