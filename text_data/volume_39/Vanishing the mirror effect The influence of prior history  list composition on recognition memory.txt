comprised of more rare letters, and more uncommon
combinations of letters (Estes & Maddox, 2002; Malmberg et
al. 2002)—and belong to much sparser orthographic
neighborhoods, with both fewer and rarer neighbors (Landauer
& Streeter, 1973).
   In a random selection of words, LF items will also be more
semantically distinctive than their HF counterparts. This is
guaranteed by the distributional properties of the lexicon—
specifically the fact that LF words are drawn from a much
larger sample than their HF counterparts (using a 1 per million
word cutoff, 80% of all words can be classified as low
frequency; van Heuven et al. 2014). As a result, LF items will
be less semantically similar to one another, on average, than HF
items. A variety of measures of semantic richness attest to this:
LF words have fewer closer associates (Deese, 1960; Balota et
al., 2004), fewer close semantic neighbors (Pexman et al.,
2008), and more sparse network connectivity (Steyvers &
Tenenbaum, 2005).
   While HF items are better differentiated in memory, they are

1 This conclusion fits well with the finding that word frequency effects in recognition are closely related to list composition. Systematically varying
the frequency of targets and foils in pure list conditions neatly illustrates this point. While a list of LF targets is similarly well-discriminated when
paired with a set of HF or LF foils, foil-frequency dramatically affects discrimination of HF targets. When paired with LF foils, the error rate is
close to zero; when paired with other HF foils, the error rate far exceeds that of LF targets (Underwood & Freund, 1970). In line with this, raising
the proportion of HF items on a list increases the magnitude of the WFE (Dorfman & Glanzer, 1988; Malmberg & Murnane, 2002).

semantic categories should disproportionately amplify item
noise for LF items, by increasing the semantic and orthographic
confusability of targets and distractors (Figure 1).
   To create reading materials for the comprehension task, short
passages were excerpted from the collected works of the
notable Columbian author, Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
Specifically, for each word on each of the lists, a passage
containing that word was identified and paired with a true
statement that synthesized the sentence in which the word had
occurred. Affirming the statement as true relied on correct
comprehension of the word. Additionally, 20 control passages,
which contained no critical items, were selected and paired
with a false statement. Each critical word appeared in only one
of all possible paragraphs, and only once in that paragraph.
   To gauge how pre-exposure affected recognition accuracy             Figure 2: Control item performance for correct RT (right panel) and

Procedure In the first stage of the experiment, subjects
completed a self-paced reading comprehension task in which
they read a series of short passages and, following each
paragraph, were presented with a short statement and asked to
determine whether it was true or false. Subjects then moved to
a different experiment room to complete a 20-minute distractor
task, in which they solved a series of tangram puzzles. They
then returned to the original room to complete the list
recognition task.
   At study, 160 words were presented on a computer monitor
for 1s each, separated by a 100 ms ISI. At test, subjects were
presented with a new set of items, and asked to judge whether a        Figure 3. The effect of prior reading exposure on critical items, as

Order of presentation for passages and for list items was
randomized.
Results Looking first to the control items, which were drawn
from tightly clustered semantic categories, but did not vary in
their exposure history: Welch two-sample t-tests confirmed that

significantly different (p>.5), and the speed of correct
rejections was slower for LF foils, both by items
