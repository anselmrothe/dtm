lexical flexibility affected participants’ guesses about the
extension of the object name – e.g., by making them more
likely to privilege shared material as basis for extension in
the flexibility conditions – using a forced-choice task (Study
1) and a more open-ended sorting task (Study 2).

unambiguous condition they were given different labels. A

participants learn distinct material and object senses of a
flexible word, or instead a single vague meaning
encompassing both objects and materials.

participants use a prior sense of the word to constrain their
interpretation of a new word sense, they should be more
likely to override a shape bias–which typically arises when a
count noun labels a rigid object (Landau et al., 1988)–and
choose the material-match object in the flexibility condition.
   The material vs. object condition was conducted to test
whether participants who learned that the material and
object were given the same word (e.g., when both were
labeled gup) in fact learned two distinct senses of the word
(as opposed to a single word that can label both materials
and objects). To test this, at test participants were asked to
choose between the material-match object and a pile of the
material. We reasoned that if subjects had learned a novel
object sense of the critical word, they would choose the                 Figure 2: Percentage of trials in Experiment 1 in which children

Catch trials Finally, participants completed three catch
trials at the end of the task to ensure that they had sustained
their attention throughout the study. In these trials, the
experimenter labeled a novel object with a novel word, and
then asked participants to point to which of two subsequent
objects could be labeled by the word. One of the choice
objects was identical, and the other differed in shape and
material. Participants who failed to correctly respond on at
least two out of the three catch trials were excluded.

Our results are consistent with the idea that the meaning of
one word sense guides children’s guesses about subsequent                Figure 3: Percentage of trials that adults chose the material-match

One possibility left open by the results of Experiment 1 is
whether children in the flexibility condition might have
chosen to extend the novel label for the object only to other
items that matched in both material and shape, had they not
been forced to choose between a material match and shape
match (a limitation of the 2-alternative-forced-choice task
used in Experiment 1).
                        Experiment 2
Here, we employed a more open-ended task, giving
participants more choice in how they determined the
extension of the newly-learned words. 4-year-olds and
adults were taught a label for a novel material and a label
for a novel standard object, just as in the flexibility and
unambiguous conditions of Experiment 1. Then, participants
were shown an array of new objects that varied in shape,
material, and size from the standard object, and were asked
to classify which of these additional objects could be labeled
by the same word as the word for the standard object (Fig.
4). As in Experiment 1, we varied whether the newly-
learned object and newly-learned material shared a label.
Using this method, we were interested in whether                  Figure 4: An example test trial from Experiment 2. Participants

stirred the material with the spoon and then scooped and/or
stretched the material, and took some material out of the jar

indeed a material). The name of the material varied
