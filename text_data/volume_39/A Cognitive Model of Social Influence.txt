Abstract
We describe two different cognitive process models of a well
known experiment on social influence (Salganik, Dodds, &
Watts, 2006). One model, the social influence model,
reproduced the choices that participants took by modeling
both the cognitive processes the participant engaged in and
the social influences that the participant saw. The second
model, the pure cognitive model, used only cognitive
capabilities and did not model any social influences that the
participant saw. Somewhat surprisingly, the two models
showed no difference in quality of fit (the pure cognitive
model actually fit slightly better than the social influence
model), suggesting that social influence models should take
cognitive functions into account in their theories.
Keywords: Cognitive models, social influence, cognitive
architectures

Introduction
People are routinely influenced by other people: this is the
crux of social influence. There are many factors that can
impact social influence, including the popularity of others
(Cialdini, Reno, & Kallgren, 1990; Latane, 1981), authority
or expertise (Cialdini et al., 1990; Milgram, 1963), and
culture (Milgram, 1963). While each of these factors can
have a large impact in different situations, a fourth factor,
visibility -- seeing what others have done or are doing -seems to be among the most important (Cialdini et al.,
1990).
Most models of social influence describe the effect in
terms of social constructs (e.g., conformity, peer pressure,
etc.) and/or networks of people (e.g., families or friends),
and that cognition has a relatively minor explanatory role.
For example, MacCoun (2012, in press) has proposed a
very successful model of social influence called the uBOP
(unidirectional burden of proof). The model itself is a
mathematical model in the form
p = m / (1 + exp[c(S/T - b)])

where p is the probability that an individual chooses an
option, m is a ceiling parameter, S is the number of people
advocating one option, T is the number of advocates
advocating a second option, b denotes where an individual
is more likely to adopt the group’s decision and c reflects
the difficulty to make a decision (steepness). This model
can successfully characterize the classic Milgram (1969)
and Asch (1951) studies with few changes in parameters
(MacCoun, 2012; MacCoun, in press).
Social network models have also been used to model
social influences. Social networks consist of nodes (people)
who are linked through some form of interdependency
(family, friends, beliefs, etc.). Social networks have been
very successful at differentiating the effects of social ties
from other external influences and have been applied to
explain phenomena as diverse as smoking (Christakis &
Fowler, 2008) and obesity (Christakis & Fowler, 2007).
Social network models typically use graph theoretic or
network models or statistical models (e.g., structural
modeling or autoregression).
Cognition in all of these models serves, at best, a purely
functional role: people perceive others' actions or remember
actions that others have performed, but the theoretical power
comes from social or network constructs. The uBOP model
can be used to describe both individuals and groups, but has
nothing that could be considered a cognitive process. Social
network models describe relationships and membership
rather than an individual's cognitive activities. The fact that
there are few (if any) cognitive processes in these models is,
perhaps, not surprising: most of the existing models are not
process models. We believe that cognition is a large
component of most social behavior and will explore this
issue by developing a cognitive process model of a wellknown social influences study (Salganik et al., 2006;
Salganik & Watts, 2009).
Salganik and colleagues investigated the effects of social
influence in a cultural market with a novel paradigm

3362

(Salganik et al., 2006; Salganik & Watts, 2009). Salganik et
al. created an artificial music market where participants
could listen and download previously unknown songs.
Salganik and colleagues created independent instantiations,
or worlds, where the markets could grow without influence
from other worlds; this was a between subjects
manipulation. Individuals in each world could only be
influenced by individuals in their own world. This approach
allowed the authors to explore how social influences
develop over time in different situations. Across two
experiments, they looked at two conditions, an independent
world and a social influence world. Participants in the
independent world made decisions about what songs to
listen to based only on the names of the bands and the song,
while in the social influence worlds, participants could also
see how many times each song had been downloaded by
previous participants. In their first experiment, they found a
modest social influences effect, but in their second
experiment they found a very strong social influences effect.
We describe and model the second experiment.

Method (Salganik et al., 2006)
A complete description of the experiment can be found in
Salganik et al. (2006) and Salganik and Watts (2009).

Participants
There were 7192 participants recruited from a music
website (Bolt). There were approximately 700 participants
in each of eight social influence worlds and approximately
1400 participants in the independent world.1 Participants
logged onto the website and various times over 83 days.

Figure 1: A screenshot of the social influence world,
taken from Salganik and Watts (2009).
Participants were able to click any song on the list to
listen to it. While the song was playing, participants were
asked to rate the song on a 1-5 scale where 1 was “I hate it”
and 5 was “I love it.” After rating the song, participants
could download the song and then could go back to the
primary display so they could listen, rate, and download
more songs if they chose. Participants were able to
download as many of the 48 songs as they wished, but they
had to listen to them and rate them before they could
download each song.
Each of the social worlds began in a random state, so each
social world could evolve based on the participants’
behavior in that specific world.

Measures

Setup and Procedure
48 Songs were presented in a single column and sorted by
the number of downloads for the social influence worlds
and in a random order for the independent world. The
display was updated as every participant downloaded songs.
Additionally, the social influence world displays contained
information about the number of downloads each song had
received; this information was dynamically updated as the
experiment progressed; see Figure 1.

There were several different variables that the authors coded
in the data. The number of songs each participant listened
to and the number of downloads that were made was
recorded. The popularity of individual songs was also
recorded. One of the most informative variables that was
recorded was how often participants listened to a song at a
specific rank (regardless of what song it was). When each
participant examined songs, each song had a specific market
rank (the song with the most downloads had a market rank
of #1).

Results and Discussion
Salganik et al. reported that participants listened to an
average of 3.6 songs and downloaded an average of 1.4
songs. Figure 2 shows the probability that a participant
would listen to a song based on its rank market share. Note
that all the social influence worlds will be combined for this
and all further analyses, as reported in Salganik et al.

The participant size was unbalanced because the original
authors were concerned about unpredictability. For our purposes it
should not impact our results.

Figure 2: The probability that a participant would listen
to a song based on its rank market share for both the
independent and social influence conditions in Salganik et
al.’s experiment.
As Figure 2 suggests, the independent condition was
mostly flat, with no strong effect of either social influence
or of song quality. However, the social influence conditions
showed a very strong effect of social influence: the top
ranked song had a 45% chance of being listened to, while
the average song had only a 5% chance of being listened to.
There is also an interesting “hipster” effect when the song
that was ranked last got listened to a great deal more than
average.
Salganik et al. suggest that these results “confirm that the
popularity of the songs affected participants’ choices and
generally led them to listen to the more popular songs—a
result that is consistent with the large literature on social
influence and conformity” (Salganik & Dobbs, 2009, p.
447). They also show that while specific songs were
considered better than others, the social influence condition
had a substantial effect on the success of the songs.
As suggested earlier, most models of social influence are
not cognitive process models. So we developed a cognitive
process model of the individuals in this experiment in order
to examine the effect of cognition and social influence. By
developing a process model, we were able to create two
slightly different models: a social influence model and a
pure cognitive model. By developing the two models, we
will be able to determine how much better the social
influence model fits the data beyond the pure cognitive
model and thus determine the importance of social influence
over basic cognitive factors. The models were developed
using the ACT-R architecture.

ACT-R is a hybrid symbolic/sub-symbolic production-based
system (Anderson et al., 2004; Anderson, 2007). ACT-R
consists of a number of modules, buffers, and a central
pattern matcher. Modules in ACT-R contain a relatively
specific cognitive faculty usually associated with a specific
region of the brain. For each module, there are one or more
buffers that communicate directly with that module as an
interface to the rest of ACT-R. At any point in time, there
may be at most one item in any individual buffer; thus, the
module’s job is to decide what and when to put a symbolic
object into a buffer. The pattern matcher uses the contents of
the buffer to match specific productions.
ACT-R uses if-then rules (productions) that will fire when
their preconditions are met by matching the contents of the
buffers. If there is more than one production that can fire,
the one with the highest utility (production strength) will
fire. Each production can change either internal state (e.g.,
buffer contents) or perform an action (e.g., click on a
button).
ACT-R interfaces with the outside world through the
visual module, the aural module, the motor module, and the
vocal module. The architecture supports other faculties
through intentional, imaginal, temporal and declarative
modules.

High Level Description of the Social Influences
Model
There are three components to each model: search,
consideration, and decision-making. Each component has
different productions that instantiate the specific goal.
There model is a pure performance model: there is no
learning in the model.
Search ACT-R has a theory about visual attention (Byrne &
Anderson, 1998), which this model follows. In brief, the
model searches for an unattended song, then moves its
visual attention to that song and then encodes the
information about the song. The model determines which
song to search for in one of four ways:
(1) The model begins at the top of the display to search
for an unattended song. This is typical ACT-R
behavior for searching.
(2) The model finds a random song and attends to it.
(3) The model starts at the bottom of the display to
search for an unattended song. This is the “hipster”
component of the model.
(4) Stop searching completely and finish.
All four of these rules are in competition any time the
model has a goal to look for a song. Note that if we were in
a different culture where reading occurred in a different
direction, the model would need to take those preferences
into account. Also note that sometimes the model will have
a goal to search for a new song and then give up;
participants also began the study and stopped the
experiment before listening to any songs.

3364

Consideration After a song has been attended to and
encoded, the model next determines whether that song
should be listened to or not. It has three options:
(1) The model decides that the song “looks interesting”
so it decides to listen to it. We assume that people
have some preference for the name of the band or
the name of the song; this is a simple version of
that preference process.
(2) The model decides that the song “looks terrible” so
it decides not to listen to it. Again, this is a simple
way to model the preferences that people have.
(3) The song is listened to based on its rank. The
probability is a very simple 1/rank. There are
other, more sophisticated versions of selection
based on group behavior (Mullen, 1983), but this
simple version suffices for this model. Note that
this is where social influence occurs in this model.
All three of these rules are in competition any time the
model has a goal for considering whether to listen to the
song. If the model decides not to listen to a song, it
searches for another song.
Decision-making If the model does listen to a song, it must
next decide whether to download it. The decision to
download is very straightforward: there is a 50% chance the
model will decide it should download the song. If it does
download the song, the world is updated; if it does not
download the song the world is not updated in any way, but
the model then searches for another song.

A series of sample experimental model runs
For the following example, three models are run in the same
world; the social influences model is being run in the social
influences condition.
We assume that each model
corresponds to a single simulated participant. The world is
updated based on what each model does in the world, and
the world is displayed appropriately based on what others
have done.
The first thing that the model does in an experiment is to
search for a song. The first model in the experiment stops
searching and no updating occurs.
The second model in the experiment starts at the top of
the list of songs; the first song on the list is unattended, so it
encodes it and considers whether to listen to it. The model
decides that it will listen to it and then must decide if it
should download it. There is a 50% chance the model will
download it, which it does in this case. This song now
becomes the most popular with rank 1 and for future
participants it will show as the top song on the display. The
model then searches for another song, again decides to
search from the top and finds the second song, which is the
top unattended song. The second song does not look
interesting, so the model does not listen to it (and thus does
not download it, either). The model next searches for
another song, but then stops searching and this model is
finished.

The third model sees the previously downloaded song in
the first slot. The model, however, chooses a random song
from the list and decides to listen and download it. The
model next starts at the bottom of the display and looks for
an unattended song. The model will listen to this song based
on its rank, which is currently 48; so it has approximately a
2% chance of listening to the song. Luckily, for this run the
model will listen to it, so that song now is tied for rank 1,
and all future models will evaluate appropriately. After
2000 model runs, the simulation is stopped and the
simulated world is reported.
The run just described was based on the social influences
model. In this model, social influence occurs during the
consideration stage.2
The pure cognitive model was
identical to the social influences model, except it did not
have pay attention to any social influence. Without social
influences, the model simply considers a song based on
whether it is “interesting” or “terrible.”
For all models, we kept most of the ACT-R parameter
defaults. The parameters that were changed include a
production noise parameter (.4, which is within a normal
range for this parameter) to provide some stocasticity and
the aforementioned 50% probability for downloading a
specific song. Parameter fits were run using the social
influence model and those same parameters were also used
for the pure cognitive model.

Model fit
First, it is possible to examine how many listens and
downloads each model performed and compare them to the
experimental data. On average, there were 3.6 listens per
participant in the experimental data; both models made 3.2
listens. Comparably, there were an average of 1.4
downloads per participant; both models had 1.6.
Figure 3 shows the fit of the independent condition; both
models provide the same results. As Figure 3 suggests, the
fit is quite good, with the model data overlapping a great
deal with the experimental data. Calculating an R2 is
uninformative because both the data and the model are flat.
RMSD for this model is .02, which demonstrates quite a
good fit.

2
Note that social influence also could have occurred at other
places in the model (e.g., search). However, preliminary testing
showed that the model actually fit worse when social influence
occurred in a stage other than consideration.

Figure 3: Data and model of the independent condition.
Figure 4 shows the fit for the social influence model and
Figure 5 shows the fit for the pure cognitive model. As is
evident from Figures 4 and 5, they both show quite a good
fit; Table 1 shows the quantitative fit statistics. The social
influence model had a very strong fit in both R2 and RMSE.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, the pure cognitive model
had a slightly better R2 fit and a comparable RMSE fit. We
can conclude from these analyses that the social influence
model does not fit better than the pure cognitive model.

Figure 4: Experimental data from the social influence
condition and the social influence model.

We described a process model of a well-known experiment
on social influence (Salganik et al., 2006; Salganik & Watts,
2009). The experiment showed that when people had access
to what others had done, it greatly influenced their behavior,
consistent with current theories on social influence (Cialdini
et al., 1990; MacCoun, 2012). We built two slightly
different cognitive process models that perform the
perceptual and cognitive steps in the experiment. Both the
social influence model and the pure cognitive model fit the
data extremely well. However, somewhat surprisingly, the
pure cognitive model fit the experimental data slightly better
than the social influence model. We interpret these results
as showing that for this experiment, the effect of social
influence is very small: a pure cognitive model was able to
fit the data at least as well (if not slightly better) than the
social influence model.
It was a bit surprising that the pure cognitive model and
the social influence model shared so much overlap: this is
almost assuredly one of the reasons for the similarity in the
two models. This should not come as a big surprise,
however: this type of task of searching and selecting
objects on a computer screen is a classic cognitive task that

3366

has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically
many times.
It could be argued that during the search phase, the
scanning down rule is also a social influence rule since
participants knew that songs were ranked from top to
bottom in order of the number of downloads. However, we
would argue that scanning from the top to the bottom of a
list is more a cognitive and cultural function than a social
influence function. Many other researchers have shown that
people in the US search for objects approximately top-down
and left-to-right on computer interfaces (Byrne, Anderson,
Douglass, & Matessa, 1999; Norman, 1991; Schunn &
Anderson, 1999).
Note that we are not saying that people are not influenced
by social influence. There are many experiments and
models that show the importance of social influence. For
example, Cialdini et al. (1990) found that when there was
evidence that other people had littered, individuals were
more likely to litter than when there was evidence that
people had not littered. Many other classic experiments
have shown the importance of social influence (Asch, 1951;
Milgram, 1963)
The model presented here does, however, highlight the
importance of cognitive processes in explaining at least
some social influence effects. We believe that providing a
process level description of cognitive and social behavior
will lead to a better understanding of how social influences
impact people’s behavior. Specificially, we can isolate
those processes that may result from cognitive aspects of the
task from those processes that result from social influence.
