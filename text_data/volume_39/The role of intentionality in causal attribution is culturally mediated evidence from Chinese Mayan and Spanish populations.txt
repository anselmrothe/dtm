Abstract

of the former (cf. Van & Valin & Wilkins 1996: 315-316)].
However, cross-cultural research since the 1990s has
uncovered evidence suggesting that internal dispositions
such as volition and intentions do not play the same role in
attributions of causality across cultures. Much of this
research has focused on a contrast (treated as binary)
between two types of societies that are said to differ from
one another in terms of the relative prominence of
individual agency and group agency in their members’
cognition. American culture has been said to downplay
collective agency in favor of individual agency. We assume
that our Spanish participants exhibit the same trait. In
contrast, group agency is hypothesized to play a relatively
more prominent role in Chinese culture.
For example, in one classic study, Morris & Peng (1994)
examined reports of similar crimes in Chinese- and Englishlanguage newspapers, showing that the former paid
relatively more attention to explanatory factors in the
situational context of the crime while the latter spent more
time discussing the perpetrator’s presumed disposition.
Similar patterns have been reported, with varying theoretical
conclusions, by Chiu et al (2000); Choi & Nisbett (1998),
Choi et al (1999), Maddux & Yuki (2006); Menon et al
(1999), and Peng & Knowles (2003), inter alia.
If the attribution of responsibility and causality is indeed
influenced by culture-specific folk theories of agency, then
such folk theories may also influence the role of agency in
the grammars of different languages. We are currently
laying the groundwork for a large-scale crosslinguistic study
of the representation of causality in the grammars of
languages spoken around the world. In preparation for this
effort, we decided to directly investigate the role of
intentionality in causal attributions in three populations:
Mandarin Chinese speakers from Mainland China, Spanish
speakers from Spain, and Yucatec Maya speakers from
Mexico. Mayans practice a traditional Mesoamerican
horticulturalist society surrounded by a Western-dominated
Spanish-speaking society and transitioning into the Age of

Speakers of Mandarin, Spanish, and Yucatec Maya watched
videos of two actors involved in a causal chain initiated by
one of them. After watching each video, participants divided
10 tokens into piles indicating their assignment of
responsibility for the resulting event. There was a significant
interaction between intentionality and population: causer and
causee intentionality made a significant difference only for
the Spanish and Yucatec participants, but not for the Chinese
participants. This is in line with previous findings suggesting
that internal dispositions play a lesser role in responsibility
attribution in societies in which attention to individual agency
is far more common than attention to group agency.

Introduction
Linguistic theories of the mapping between meaning and
syntactic form in language have long recognized the key
role of agency and causality. In verbal representations of
causal chains, causality and agency determine the
assignment of grammatical relations such as subject and
object, voice (active/passive), case marking, and a host of
other properties (e.g., Croft 1987; Dowty 1991; Foley &
Van Valin 1984; among many others). Yet, much of this
work implicitly treats causality and agency as universal
notions – even in crosslinguistic research (e.g., Comrie
1981; Dixon 2000; Shibatani 2002). Meanwhile, a growing
body of work in the field of social psychology calls the
universality of these notions very much into question.
Take, for example, the nexus between responsibility and
intentionality. Much theoretical work on agentivity in
language assumes that prototypical agents are volitional and
that nonvolitional causers are either atypical agents or not
agents at all (Dowty 1991; Lakoff 1977; Van Valin &
Wilkins 1996; inter alia). [We assume in the following that
volitional actions require a choice on the actor’s part and
intentional actions require a plan; the latter are thus a subset

Globalization. Their inclusion in our study allows us to open
up the investigation beyond the egocentric-sociocentric
dichotomy of the debate on ‘dispositionalism’ and
‘situationalism’ in social psychology, but also to compare
our findings to those reported in Le Guen et al (2015),
whose sample includes Yucatecans as well.
Le Guen et al (2015) investigated the role of concepts of
chance and coincidence in causal attributions among four
populations, comparing Tseltal and Yucatec Mayans, urban
Mexicans of non-indigenous descent, and Germans. They
based their stimuli on Alicke’s (2000) ‘Culpable Control
Model’, which distinguishes three components of
responsibility: whether the causer intended their immediate
action (‘IA’), whether they intended the final outcome
(‘IO’), and whether there is a causal relation between the
action and the outcome (‘AO’). The distinction between
IA and IO informed our stimulus design as well. Le
Guen et al found that intentionality had a greater effect on
the Mayan participants’ attributions of causality than on
those of the German and Mexican populations. By way of
interpretation, they tacitly point toward the tradition of
anthropological research identifying elements of ‘magical
thinking’ in traditional non-Western cultures (e.g., EvansPritchard 1937).

training clips and three of the test items were cut from news
reports, a home video show, and a movie. The remaining
videos were taped with students and faculty of the
University at Buffalo Linguistics Department staging the
actions and events. The mean duration of the test videos was
8.05 seconds (SD 4.56s). They were shown to the
participants on laptop computers.
The test items are described in Table 1 in terms of the
action/event involving the Causee. These actions/events can
all in one way or another be understood as caused by the
Causer – in some cases via a physical impact on Causee; in
others via a reflexive/uncontrolled or deliberate
psychological response to the Causer’s behavior or as a
response to a gestural command by Causer. Three
intentionality variables are represented as well: whether
Causer intended their action (IA), whether Causer
intended the outcomes of the chain (IO), and whether
Causee acted intentionally/volitionally.1

Method
Speakers of Mandarin, Spanish, and Yucatec Maya watched
videos of two actors involved in a chain of events that
culminates in a resulting event. In each case, the chain is
initiated by one actor, dubbed the Causer in the following.
The second actor is affected by the Causer’s action and may
or may not in turn affect a third, inanimate, entity. This
second actor is labeled the Causee After watching each
video, participants divided 10 tokens into piles indicating
their assignment of responsibility for the resulting event.
Piles represented ‘Causer’, ‘Causee’, and 'Neither'.

Participants
12 speakers of Yucatec Maya, 16 Mandarin speakers, and
20 Spanish speakers were recruited from and tested at sites
in Barcelona and Murcia, Spain, at Beihang University in
Beijing, China, and in the village of Yaxley, Quintana Roo,
Mexico. The Chinese participants included 8 women and 8
men aged 19-40 (M = 27.46, SD = 4.98). Spanish
participants included 12 women and 8 men aged 18-55 (M =
28, SD = 12.92). The Yucatec participants included 5
women and 7 men aged 18-76 (M = 44, SD = 16.83).
Participants completed the tasks in about 45 minutes and
were compensated 100 pesos (approximately $5 USD), 8
euros (approximately $9 USD), and a cup of coffee,
respectively (all Mandarin participants were students of the
school of foreign languages at Beihang University).

Items that are represented in terms of the same description and
configuration of variables in Table 1 differed from one another in
terms of 1) the use of an instrument by the Causee, 2) for
unintentional Causees, the medium of interaction between the
Causer and the Causee (physical (e.g., pushing) vs non-physical
(e.g., yelling loudly to startle) manipulation). The impact of these
further variables has not yet been analyzed.

Materials
The experiment comprised a training phase involving 10
video clips and a test phase with 24 video clips. Four of the

344

one another in the top row and the 'neither' circle was drawn
below them.

Procedure
Preparation. Prior to working with participants, researchers
established how to convey the concept of responsibility in
the target language. A complication of concern was the
potential for negative implications of 'blame'. To avoid
participant confusion over assigning blame to a neutral
event, researchers explained that participants should think of
assigning responsibility in terms of explaining the events to
someone who wanted to know what happened and why. For
video clips depicting one character involuntarily initiating a
causal chain, participants had to decide between prioritizing
intentionality or control in the assignment of responsibility.
This provided data on cross-cultural differences on how
these two factors were weighed.
Before the training phase, the task was explained to
participants in their native language. Participants were asked
to indicate which actor in each video was responsible for the
resulting event and reminded that they could distribute
responsibility between all three piles, two piles, or just one
pile so long as the distribution of tokens at the end of each
trial was proportional to the amount of responsibility of each
actor. After this explanation, the participant watched the 10
training videos.

Figure 2: Causee knocked into cups by causer with cart

Training. The purpose of the training phase was to allow
the participants to gradually familiarize themselves with the
rationale of the ratings procedure. For this reason, it was
designed to initiate training with six scenes in which the
assignment of responsibility seemed straightforward
(collaborative action; no involvement of either actor; or one
actor involved while the other was not), followed by four
items similar in structure to the test items, where
responsibility assignment is more competitive, at the end.
For each of the first three videos, the experimenter would
demonstrate by playing the video, and apportioning the
tokens in the appropriate way, and then would explain why
they did so. Next, the experimenter would invite the
participant to use the tokens to rate responsibility in each of
the remaining seven scenes. The experimenter would play a
clip, establish which circle on the paper represented each
actor in the video, replay the video and ask the participant to
distribute the tokens. The experimenter would correct any
confusion about allocating the tokens and verified that the
participant understood the task.

Intentionality was indicated by obvious body language on
the part of the actor, including whether or not they looked at
the causee or touched them with their hands in a manner that
appeared to be controlled. For example, in an 'unintentional'
clip, a Causer walks into a room without looking at the
causee and loudly sneezes, which causes a startled Causee
to tear a piece of paper. In the contrasting 'intentional' clip,
the Causer looks at the Causee and deliberately pushes
them, causing them to tear the paper. Four of the training
items featured scenes that fit the same parameters as the test
items. The remaining six items featured actions on which
the two actors collaborate, events that occurred without the
involvement of either actor, and events in which one actor
destroyed an object while the other looked on.
Participants were given 10 identical tokens, which
consisted of small glass stones or other objects of similar
size. To prevent confusion about the purpose of the task, no
tokens resembling currency were used. These tokens
represented total responsibility for end results in video clips
observed during the task, where each token symbolized 10%
of total responsibility. Participants were also given a sheet
of paper with three circles drawn on it. The leftmost circle
represented the actor who ended in the left-most position or
final frame of the video clip, the center circle represented
the other actor, and the right-most circle represented 'neither
actor.' Circles were arranged in a horizontal row, or in two
rows where the two circles representing actors were next to

Testing. The test items were presented in one of four
pseudo-randomized orders. Participants were randomly and
evenly distributed over these four orders.
During the test phase, participants watched the 24 test
clips. After each clip, experimenter and participant
established which circle would represent each actor in the
video and then played the video a second time. The
participant was then asked to distribute responsibility for the
final outcome of the clip between the actors. Responses

345

were recorded in a spreadsheet. Experimenters did not
question participant understanding of video clips or correct
token distribution during this portion of the experiment.
After watching the 24 clips, the participant viewed each clip
again and provided a verbal description of the action in the
video. The sessions were video recorded in their entirety.

A linear mixed effects regression model was fitted, using
the lme4 package in R and treating the Causer responsibility
rating as dependent variable. The rating was treated as a
continuous rather than ordinal (categorical) variable since
the participants expressed it through the proportional
allocation of the tokens rather than through labeled
categories. As fixed factors were included Population, IA,
IO, Causee Intentionality, and all binary interactions
between Population and the intentionality variables.
Random intercepts were added for participant and stimulus
clip (formula: CR.Responsibility ~ Population + IA +
IO + Intentionality.of.CE + Population * IA +
Population * IO + Population * Intentionality.of.CE + (1
| Participant.ID) + (1 | Clip.Code)). The three intentionality
variables were coded binarily.

Results
Exclusions
One response by a Mayan participant was accidentally
omitted from recording. There are no further missing
observations.

Predictions
If it is the case that East Asians pay relatively less attention
to internal dispositions of the causer and more to situational
factors in their causal attributions compared to Westerners,
as suggested by the line of research starting with Morris &
Peng (1994), both Causer intentionality and Causee
intentionality should play a less predictive role in the ratings
of the Chinese participants than in those of the Spanish
participants. On the other hand, Le Guen et al’s (2015)
findings suggest that Causer intentionality may play an even
greater role in the Yucatecans’ responsibility assignments
than in those of either of the other two groups.

Analysis
Figure 3 shows the mean Causer responsibility ratings by
population, suggesting small but significant differences
(Mandarin M = 7.37, SD = 2.09; Spanish M = 5.98, SD =
3.14; Yucatec M = 6.67, SD = 3.24). Figure 4 presents a
breakdown by Causer intentionality, suggesting that the
Mayan and Spanish participants, but not the Chinese
participants, assigned more responsibility to intentional than
to unintentional Causers, as predicted.

and Causer intentionality
Table 2 summarizes the effects. Due to the multitude of
models, the confidence level should be Bonferroni-adjusted
to p<.001. Effects outside this level should be ignored.
There were main effects of population and causee
intentionality and significant interactions between
population and the IA link and between population and
causee intentionality. There was neither a main effect of the
IO link nor did it feature in any significant interaction.
Collinearity of factors above .6 occurred exclusively
between the absence of IA and the absence of IO (to be
expected, as in the design of the items, the former entails the
latter, i.e., we did not include scenes in which an unintended
action accidentally yielded an intended outcome; cf. Table
1) and between some of the interactions and either their
component factors or interactions sharing a factor.

Discussion
The presence of an unintentional (nonvolitional) Causee
significantly boosted attribution of responsibility to the
causer across populations. This is of course eminently
plausible and thus can be seen as very basic support of
internal validity.
In line with what Figure 1 suggests, the Spanish and
Yucatec participants’ ratings were significantly lower than
those of the Chinese participants, although the differences

Figure 3: Mean Causer responsibility rating by population

were quite small. This effect is plausibly attributable to the
Spanish and Yucatecan participants having paid more
attention to the intentionality/volitionality of the Causee
than the Chinese participants, in line with the hypothesis
that intentionality plays a lesser role in the Chinese
participants’ attributions.

which an unintended action caused a certain result (which in
our stimuli was likewise unintended). In all instances, the
relevant actions of the Causer involved spontaneous bodily
functions (yawning, sneezing, losing balance, fainting).
Such acts caused the Spanish and Yucatec participants, but
not the Chinese participants, to rate the Causer’s
responsibility lower. In contrast, we found no significant
effect for scenes in which intended actions had unintended
consequences (e.g., causing somebody to leave the room by
singing poorly or causing somebody to knock down a cup
tower by running into them while dragging a cart backwards
into the room).

General discussion
We did not find greater sensitivity to intentionality among
our Mayan participants than among the other two groups.
There is thus no apparent evidence of remnants of ‘magical
thinking’ in our traditional non-Western population,
contrary to the findings of Le Guen et al (2015). However,
as predicted by a line of studies in social psychology, the
Chinese participants in our experiment appear to have been
less inclined to factor the intentionality of both the Causer
and the Causee into their attributions of responsibility than
the Spanish participants. To our knowledge, this has been
demonstrated here for the first time in terms of relative
responsibility distribution between competing actors.

Future research

Crucial for the evaluation of our predictions are the
interactions between population and the causer
intentionality variables. In line with our predictions, we
found that absence of the IA link – i.e., an unintended
action on the causer’s part – strongly positively interacted
with Chinese against Spanish as baseline and vice versa. In
other words, the Chinese participants’ responsibility scores
for unintentional causers were significantly higher than the
Spanish participants, in line with predictions. The relevant
interactions with Yucatec were not significant by the
Bonferroni criterion.
Turning to unintentional causees, this factor showed a
significant positive interaction with Spanish against Chinese
as baseline. The Spanish participants rated Causer
intentionality higher than the Chinese participants when the
Causee was unintentional. This suggests that the Spanish
participants paid more attention to the intentionality of the
causee than the Chinese participants did – again in line with
predictions. When Spanish was the baseline, significant
negative interactions with both Chinese and Yucatec were
found (and when Yucatec was the baseline, of course the
inverse positive interaction with Spanish materialized). This
suggests that the Spanish participants rated Causer
responsibility relatively higher when the Causee was acting
involuntarily than did the Yucatec participants. It thus
appears that Causee intentionality played a greater role for
the Spanish participants than for the Yucatecans.
The difference between the populations was specifically
located in scenes that lacked IA, in other words, scenes in

Whether our evidence of culture-specificity in causal
attributions submits to the explanatory mechanisms in
terms of folk theories of group agency vs. individual agency
and/or context sensitivity invoked in research tradition that
motivated the present study remains to be seen. A crucial
test will be the extension of the investigation to other
populations of the supposed ‘egocentric’ vs. ‘sociocentric’
types. We are currently preparing to test further populations.
A question we intend to take up in the next phase of our
investigation is whether the apparent difference in causal
attribution also manifests itself in the grammatical means
used when members of the different groups talk about
causality. It has often been observed that more agentive
causal chains tend to be represented more compactly in
language than less agentive ones. Thus, Sally made Floyd
knock over the cup tower implicates, but does not entail, that
Sally acted intentionally, whereas Sally bumped into Floyd
and he knocked over the cup tower does not (McCawley
1976). This predicts that members of sociocentric societies
may use relatively more compact representations of lowintentionality scenarios than members of egocentric
societies. If confirmed, this could suggest a relationship
between grammars and folk theories of agency.
For the treatment of agency in linguistic theories, two
responses to our findings are conceivable: retain a universal
notion of agency, which then plays a variable role in the
grammars of different languages, or replace it with culturespecific concepts of agency, which then would stand a
chance of playing a more uniform role across languages.
