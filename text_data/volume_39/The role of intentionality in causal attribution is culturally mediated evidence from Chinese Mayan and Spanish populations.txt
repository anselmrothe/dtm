If it is the case that East Asians pay relatively less attention
to internal dispositions of the causer and more to situational
factors in their causal attributions compared to Westerners,
as suggested by the line of research starting with Morris &
Peng (1994), both Causer intentionality and Causee
intentionality should play a less predictive role in the ratings
of the Chinese participants than in those of the Spanish
participants. On the other hand, Le Guen et al’s (2015)
findings suggest that Causer intentionality may play an even
greater role in the Yucatecans’ responsibility assignments
than in those of either of the other two groups.
