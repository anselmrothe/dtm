Data Analysis
The results of the experiment were analysed using a mixed
linear regression model including the factors of evidence vol-
ume, concentration condition and trait type. As the first test
block was intended to provide a baseline, being unaffected by
either volume or concentration, ratings from this round were
not included in the regression model. This was confirmed us-
ing independent t-tests, finding no significant difference be-
tween conditions in either congruent ratings (t(114) = .190, p
= .850) or incongruent ratings (t(114) = .296, p = .768) in the
first test block.
   The regression model showed significant effects for vol-
ume in both congruent (β = -2.23, t(5086) = 6.41, p < .001)
and incongruent ratings (β = 6.49, t(5086) = 15.6, p < .001),
