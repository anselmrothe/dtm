were calculated from the eye-fixation data.
Such measures allow a range of questions to be answered
about people’s search:
     1) Is search consistent with the manipulated order or
          do people switch between searching between
          information sets frequently when given the choice?
     2) How is search behavior affected by changes to the
          order and orientation?
     3) Does this search behavior map onto subsequent
          treatment evaluations?
Predictions: Three main predictions were made, based on
the literature presented above:
 Based on Bergus et al (2002), a recency effect is
    predicted. Thus, people should be more influenced by
    the information presented last.
 Despite simultaneous presentation, people will read
    information according to the manipulated order (i.e. in
    the order consistent with reading patterns).                  Irrespective of presentation order (orientation) after each

Time Proportion: Another potentially relevant variable in
determining people’s subsequent choices is the proportion
of time spent looking at the different types of information
(i.e. risk and benefits), which helps to represent a measure
of attention (i.e. amount of attention paid to each type of
information).
Using the interest areas that were preset into the eye-link
analysis software, this measure calculated the time spent
looking in each interest area. This was then transformed
into a proportion of time by dividing the time spent in the                Figure 3: The effect of order and orientation on looking
