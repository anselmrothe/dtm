Figure 1. The estimated effects of non-consent on one of the test measurements: the number of unique actions children performed
during the first minute of play. We tested whether the mean and the standard deviation measured from the consented group (1c, blue
bars) are unbiased estimates of the population. To do so, we separated the consented group according to the number of PQs parents
asked children during the observation prior to the test (1a). Parents who asked more PQs tended to have children who performed
more unique actions during the test. On the other hand, as shown in (1b), parents who asked more PQs also tended to consent their
children to participate (blue) rather than not consent (red). These two associations resulted in the simulated not-consented group to
have a lower mean than the consented group (1c), by an estimated effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.2. Compared to the population (purple
bars), focusing on the consented group may result in an overestimation of the mean and an underestimation of the standard deviation.
