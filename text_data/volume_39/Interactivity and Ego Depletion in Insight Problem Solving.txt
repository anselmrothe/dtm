having to inhibit word choice responses.
  During the second part of the experiment, all the
participants were shown a sheet of paper (size A4) on
which 17 digits were randomly printed. They were
instructed to add these numbers as quickly and accurately
as possible; however, participants had to keep their hands
palm down on the table top and hence the mental
arithmetic could not be supplemented or supported by
complementary actions, such as touching the printed
numbers of pointing at them.
  In the third and final part of the experiment participants
worked on the triangle of coins problem for five minutes;
half of the participants were allocated to the low
interactivity condition, half to the high interactivity
condition. The problem was illustrated on a 9x9 grid
printed on a sheet of paper: Columns were labelled with
letters (A-I) and rows with numbers (1-9). Ten tokens were
arrayed on that grid, each token labelled with an individual
letter (see Fig. 2); the solution to the problem involved
moving tokens R, W, A to cells E4, B7, and H7 to reorient
the triangle such that it pointed up rather than down.
Participants in the low interactivity condition worked on
the problem with hands palm down on the table top, and
voiced their proposed moves to the experimenter in groups
of three moves: They would name the token and then the
cell coordinate where it should be moved. The
experimenter noted the moves on a record sheet hidden
from the participants’ view, and provided feedback. It’s         Figure 2: The problem instructions in the low interactivity
