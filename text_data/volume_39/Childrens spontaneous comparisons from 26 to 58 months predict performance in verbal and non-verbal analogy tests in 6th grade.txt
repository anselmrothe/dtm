Abstract
Comparison supports the development of children’s analogical
reasoning. The evidence for this claim comes from laboratory studies. We describe spontaneous comparisons produced
by 24 typically developing children from 26 to 58 months.
Children tend to express similarity before expressing difference. They compare objects from the same category before
objects from different categories, make global comparisons before specific comparisons, and specify perceptual features of
similarity/difference before non-perceptual features. We then
investigate how a theoretically interesting subset of children’s
comparisons – those expressing a specific feature of similarity or difference – relates to analogical reasoning as measured
by verbal and non-verbal tests in 6th grade. The number of
specific comparisons children produce before 58 months predicts their scores on both tests, controlling for vocabulary at
54 months. The results provide naturalistic support for experimental findings on comparison development, and demonstrate
a strong relationship between children’s early comparisons and
their later analogical reasoning.

Introduction
Comparison – the process of jointly examining two objects
or events and assessing their similarities and differences – is
crucial in the development of children’s word learning, categorization, and analogical reasoning skills (Namy & Gentner, 2002; Gentner & Namy, 2006; Gentner, Anggoro, &
Klibanoff, 2011; Richland & Simms, 2015). Comparison
is an effective learning tool because it promotes structural
alignment: the mapping of two representations in a way
that enables the recognition of relational commonalities and
alignable differences. A large body of experimental work
shows that inviting children to compare exemplars helps them
to move beyond overall or global similarity to more specific
kinds of similarity, including similarity based on relational
commonalities, as in analogical reasoning (Loewenstein &
Gentner, 2001; Christie & Gentner, 2014; Gentner et al.,

2016). However, to get a full picture of the role of comparison in the development of children’s analogical reasoning skills, it is important to relate this experimental work
to children’s spontaneous behavior in a naturalistic environment. Previous work has shown that children spontaneously
produce comparative utterances from early in their language
development: for example, children spontaneously generate
metaphors from the age of around 2 (Winner, 1979) and are
able to explain them in terms of similarity (Billow, 1981).
However, the nature of the comparisons children produce is
not static over time, but follows a developmental trajectory.
Özçalışkan, Goldin-Meadow, Gentner, and Mylander (2009)
found that while children’s earliest comparisons tended to be
between objects that were similar to each other in many features, the acquisition of the word ‘like’ was associated with
an increase in the number of comparisons between objects
that only shared a single feature. These specific comparisons
are argued to be a more sophisticated stage in the development of children’s understanding of similarity than are global
comparisons (Smith, 1989; Gentner & Rattermann, 1991).
As such, the prevalence of specific comparisons in children’s
early speech could potentially be an index of their later analogical reasoning skill.
The current work has two aims: 1) a descriptive aim, to
characterize common patterns in the development of children’s spontaneous comparisons produced in naturalistic contexts in the home; 2) an inferential aim, to test the hypothesis that variation in children’s production of specific, singlefeature comparisons predicts variation in their scores on tests
of analogical ability given much later, in 6th grade.

Methods
Participants
24 children and their primary caregivers were drawn from a
larger sample of 64 families who participated in a longitudi-

coded for whether they expressed similarity (e.g. ‘go like a
elephant’) or difference (e.g. ‘I’m bigger than everybody!’).

nal study of language development (the same sample drawn
on by Özçalışkan et al., 2009). Families were recruited via
direct mailings to targeted zip codes and an advertisement in
a free monthly parenting magazine. Parents who responded
were interviewed regarding background characteristics, and
the final sample was selected to be representative of the
greater Chicago area in terms of race, ethnicity and income.
The sub-sample of 24 families in the current study was selected randomly, within the constraints of preserving the demographic spread of the original sample. Of the 24 children,
11 were male and 13 female; 18 were white (of whom 3 were
Hispanic), 3 were Black or African-American, and 3 were of
two or more races. The distribution of socio-economic status
across the 24 families was similar to that of the original sample, ranging from families with an income of under $15,000
where the primary caregiver had some high school education,
to families with an income of over $100,000 where the primary caregiver had an advanced degree.

Global or specific comparison. Comparisons were coded
for whether they expressed global similarity/difference (e.g.,
for Objects, ‘I have toys just like yours’; for Events, ‘they
both win’), or specific similarity/difference (e.g., for Objects,
‘red like the ladybug’; for Events, ‘I go a lot faster than when I
was three’). Comparisons could be specific even if the objects
compared were overall similar, e.g., ‘this [tree] is the tallest
[tree]’. We expect global comparisons to appear earlier than
specific comparisons (Smith, 1989; Gentner & Rattermann,
1991).

Procedure
Parents and children were visited in their homes and videotaped engaging in their normal daily activities for 90 minutes. Home visits began when the children were 14 months
old and continued at 4-month intervals, ending when the children were 58 months old (12 sessions in total).1 All child
speech, and all parent speech directed to the child, was transcribed. Transcription reliability was established by having a
second individual transcribe 20% of each transcriber’s tapes.
Reliability was at or above 95%.

Coding
Comparisons were coded from the transcripts of child speech
during the 12 sessions. The criterion for a comparison was
that the child expressed a similarity or difference between an
identifiable source and target. Sources and targets could be
objects or events. In cases where the source and target of
the comparison were unclear from the transcript alone, the
original video was consulted. For each identified comparison,
we coded the following:
Word. The word that made the utterance a comparison; e.g.
‘I’m a funny one like you’ would be coded as ‘like’.
Word category. Comparative words were classified into six
categories: like (the words ‘like’ and ‘alike’), same/different
(the words ‘same’ and ‘different’), comparative/superlative
(any comparative or superlative adjective, e.g., ‘bigger’,
‘best’), too (used either in contexts like ‘too big’ or contexts like ‘I’m dancing too’), match (e.g., ‘these match each
other’), and other.

Feature specified. Where a feature of similarity or difference was specified, this feature was coded. Features were
classified into 6 categories: Spatial (e.g., size, shape, distance, speed), Sensory (e.g., color, weight, taste, smell), Evaluative (e.g., goodness, prettiness, badness), Emotion (e.g., being tired, mad, scared), Preference (e.g., liking one thing better than another thing),2 and Other. Features were also classified as Perceptual (based on a readily perceptible attribute,
e.g. color, size) or Non-Perceptual (based on a more abstract,
not directly perceptible feature, e.g., preference, goodness).
Within or between-category comparison. Comparisons
were coded for whether the objects compared were from the
same or different superordinate categories. Superordinate
categories were taken from Özçalışkan et al. (2009), with
three additions to accommodate new data (in italics): people, animals, body parts, vehicles, clothing, furniture, appliances, kitchen utensils, tools, musical instruments, food,
plants, activity toys, places, decorations/crafts, words/letters,
and shapes.
In the case of events, the objects of interest were those
with corresponding roles in the two events. For example, if
the parent said she was going to use some yellow paint, and
the child said ‘think I’ll do yellow too’, the objects in corresponding roles (parent/child, and yellow paint/yellow paint)
are in the same superordinate categories (people and decorations/crafts, respectively). This would therefore be coded as
a within-category comparison. If the child said ‘I’m going to
act like a bee’, the objects in corresponding roles (child and
bee) are in different superordinate categories (people and animals); this would therefore be coded as a between-category
comparison. If children initially rely on overall similarity,
then within-category comparisons should emerge earlier than
between-category comparisons.
A total of 532 comparisons were codable under these
guidelines.

Object or event. Comparisons were coded for whether the
Source and Target were objects (e.g., ‘this [rug] look like a
skirt’) or events (e.g., ‘I win too’).

Later outcomes

1 Since no comparisons were produced before session 4 (26
months), graphs & analyses focus on sessions 5-12 (26-58 months).

2 Utterances using the word ‘favorite’ were not coded, since it
was not clear that children understood its meaning as comparative.

The same children were followed longitudinally as part of
an ongoing language development project. When the chil-

dren were in 6th grade (aged around 13 years), we administered two tests of analogical reasoning: the Verbal Analogies subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive
Abilities (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001), and a nonverbal test, Raven’s Progressive Matrices (Raven, 1938). The
Woodcock-Johnson Verbal Analogies is an orally administered test that consists of sets of paired items. The participant
has to fill in the missing item by abstracting the relation that
holds between the first pair. For example, the participant is
given the prompt ‘mother is to father, as sister is to...’, and
expected to fill in the missing term ‘brother’. Raven’s Progressive Matrices consists of a series of geometric analogy
problems. The participant is presented with a matrix that has
one entry missing and must select the correct entry from an
array of 6-8 choices. These two measures were taken as outcomes in our analyses.

and difference across sessions.

Comparison words
The most commonly used comparison word was ‘like’, followed by ‘too’, ‘bigger’, ‘same’, and ‘better’. Together, these
words accounted for 73% of the comparisons the children expressed. Table 1 shows counts and percentages for the word
categories detailed in the Methods.

Results
Onset and prevalence of comparisons
Children varied in the age at which they produced their first
comparison. For the purpose of this analysis, age of onset was
defined as children’s age during the session where they produced at least one comparison and also produced at least one
comparison during the immediately following session. Under this criterion, the earliest onset was at 26 months, and the
latest was at 50 months. The average age of onset was 36
months, with a standard deviation of 6 months. Comparisons
were relatively infrequent: they ranged from 0% to 2.2% of
a child’s utterances in a given session. However, the fact that
we reliably find comparisons even in short 90-minute sessions
suggest they are a robust feature of children’s early talk.

Figure 1 shows the frequencies of the 4 most prevalent
word categories over sessions. ‘Like’ is the first word
category to reliably emerge. While ‘like’ and comparatives/superlatives are overall more frequent, all word categories generally show an increase in use across sessions.

Expressing similarity and difference
Figure 2 shows the trend over sessions for expressing similarity versus difference. Similarity comparisons were more
numerous overall (346 to 186). The general trend was for
similarity comparisons to emerge earlier than difference comparisons, and to remain more numerous until the final session.
On a by-individual level, 20 out of 24 children produced a
similarity comparison before they produced a difference comparison; 1 produced a difference comparison before produc-

Features specified
The most frequently specified features were spatial or sensory; together, these accounted for 70% of the specific comparisons the children expressed. Table 2 shows overall counts

ing a similarity comparison; and 3 produced examples of both
simultaneously. This trend for similarities to precede differences was significant, χ2 = 27.25, p < .001.

Objects and events
While object comparisons were more numerous in general
(358 compared to 174 event comparisons), the overall trend
was for object and event comparisons to emerge at around the
same time. 11 out of 24 children produced an object comparison before they produced an event comparison; 8 produced
an event comparison before they produced an object comparison; and 5 produced examples of both simultaneously. The
trend in ordering was not significant, χ2 = 2.25, p = .32. Thus
it appears that from comparison onset, children are capable of
expressing comparisons between events as well as comparisons between objects.

Global and specific comparisons
The numbers of global and specific comparisons were
broadly equivalent: 249 global to 283 specific. Figure 3
shows the trend over sessions. Global comparisons appear
to be more numerous than specific comparisons in the first
two sessions; in subsequent sessions they are at equivalent
levels, until the final two sessions when specific comparisons
are higher. By individuals, as predicted, global comparisons
tended to precede specific comparisons: 14 of 24 children
produced a global comparison before they produced a specific comparison, while 5 produced a specific comparison before they produced a global comparison, and 5 produced both
in the same session. While not as strong as the tendency for
similarity to precede difference, this trend in ordering was
significant, χ2 = 6.75, p = .034.

More perceptual features (202) were specified than nonperceptual features (80). The overall trend was for perceptual features to be specified earlier: by individual, 16 children specified perceptual features before they specified nonperceptual features, 4 specified non-perceptual features before they specified perceptual features, and 4 did both in one
session. The trend for perceptual features to be specified first
was significant, χ2 = 12, p = .002.

Within- and between-category comparisons
Comparisons between objects in the same superordinate category (or between events involving objects in the same superordinate categories) were more numerous than comparisons
between different superordinate categories (421 compared to
133). As predicted, comparisons between objects in the same
category generally tended to precede comparisons between
objects in different categories. 14 of 24 children produced a
within-category comparison before a between-category comparison. 5 produced a between-category comparison first, and
5 children did both in one session. This trend in ordering was
significantly different from chance, χ2 = 6.75, p = .034.

Comparison type interactions
We also examined interactions between comparison types.
Firstly, we asked whether the children’s comparisons expressing similarity were more likely to specify a feature than
their comparisons expressing difference, or vice versa. 118
(34%) of similarity comparisons specified a feature of similarity, while 165 (89%) of difference comparisons specified a
feature of difference. Given their marginal totals, similarity
comparisons were less likely than expected to specify features, and difference comparisons were more likely than expected to specify features. This difference was significant,
χ2 = 145.38, p < .001.
We then asked whether comparisons involving objects in
the same superordinate category were more likely to express
similarity or difference, as opposed to comparisons involving
objects in different superordinate categories. Comparisons of
within-category objects, or events involving within-category

objects, were broadly as likely to express similarity as difference: 240 (60%) of these expressed similarity. On the other
hand, comparisons of between-category objects, or events involving between-category objects, were more likely to express similarity (105, or 80%) than difference. This trend was
significant, χ2 = 15.32, p < .001.

PPVT at 54 months. Specific comparisons remained a significant predictor after controlling for PPVT, although PPVT
had a larger effect. The adjusted R2 for the model was .64,
indicating that these two variables together explain around
two-thirds of the variance in Verbal Analogies score.
Table 3: Verbal Analogies model

Relation to later outcomes
We then tested the hypothesis motivated in the Introduction,
that the number of specific comparisons (expressing a single
feature of similarity or difference) that children made during
the 12 observational sessions would predict their performance
on tests of analogical reasoning in 6th grade.
Our outcome measures were the two analogy tests described in the Methods: the Woodcock-Johnson Verbal
Analogies test, and Raven’s Progressive Matrices. Both
a verbal and a non-verbal test were administered in order
to address the potential confound of language skill, which
could influence both children’s comparison production and
their verbal analogy test scores. To further account for language proficiency, we controlled for the child’s score on the
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III; Dunn & Dunn,
1997) at 54 months (the penultimate session of the 12 during
which comparisons were collected).
Figures 4 and 5 show scatterplots of the relationship between the number of specific comparisons the children produced during the pre-school observation sessions and their
6th grade scores on the Verbal Analogies and Raven’s Progressive Matrices tests, respectively.

Table 4 shows the results of the model predicting Raven’s

In this case, a likelihood ratio test showed that adding PPVT
did not improve the model, F(1) = 1.05, p = .318. The adjusted R2 for the model was .43, indicating that specific comparison count alone explains around 40% of the variance in
Raven’s Progressive Matrices scores.

Discussion
Children’s earliest comparisons tend to express global similarity between objects or events within the same superordi-

1076

nate category. Later in development, children begin to express difference, to specify features of comparison, and to
compare objects and events from different superordinate categories. Turning to the content of these comparisons, children are particularly motivated to comment first on similarities and differences in perceptual features such as size, color,
and speed, and later on evaluative features such as goodness,
prettiness, and their opposites.
While children are more likely to express global similarity
than specific similarity, most difference comparisons are specific rather than global. This finding suggests that children
are less motivated to comment on overall dissimilarity than
on overall similarity: differences are only interesting insofar
as they are specific. We also find that comparisons involving
objects in different superordinate categories tend to disproportionately express similarity, rather than difference, despite
these objects being a priori less similar to each other. This
seemingly counter-intuitive result backs up existing theory:
more similar objects are more likely to have salient, alignable
differences than objects which are dissimilar (Markman &
Gentner, 1993; Gelman, Raman, & Gentner, 2009).
The relationship we find between children’s early comparisons and their later analogical reasoning skill can potentially be interpreted in a number of ways. One possibility is
that children who make more specific comparisons gain more
practice in identifying dimensions of similarity or difference:
thus, making these comparisons directly helps build their analogical skills in ways that persist through later development.
Another possibility is that both our predictor variable (the
prevalence of specific comparisons in the pre-school years)
and our outcome variable (performance on verbal and nonverbal analogy tests in 6th grade) can be traced back to an
underlying variable such as intelligence. The current work
cannot tease these explanations apart. However, in future
work, we aim to code the comparisons parents produce during the sessions before their children start producing comparisons themselves. It will then be possible to use causal modeling to investigate the extent to which parent comparison input
predicts child comparison production, controlling for parent
IQ. If parent comparison input influences child production of
comparisons beyond a heritable IQ effect, this outcome could
potentially open the door for interventions aimed at boosting
children’s comparison production in the home by providing
them with particularly helpful kinds of input.
