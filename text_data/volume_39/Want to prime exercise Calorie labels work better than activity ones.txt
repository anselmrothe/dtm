Abstract
‘Activity-equivalent’ food labels are believed to encourage
consumers to partake in exercise. This may occur by semantic
priming, where featuring images of physical activity increases
the mental accessibility of the concept of exercise, making it
more ‘fluent’ and therefore more influential on people’s
behaviour. We tested how the format of labels (image vs.
text) and representation of energy (‘activity’ vs. ‘calorie)
affected mental accessibility of exercise in a word-fragment
completion task and participants’ behavioural intentions for
exercise (N = 142). Participants exposed to calorie labels
produced more exercise-related words and viewed an
imagined exercise scenario as shorter and more enjoyable.
Images led to higher intentions to exercise than text when
they described activities but they led to lower intentions to
exercise than text when they described calories. Findings
suggest that activity labels do not trigger more activity related
thoughts, but could increase exercise intentions only if
presented in pictorial format.

Introduction
Obesity is a serious global issue, with nearly 40% of the
world’s population as overweight or obese in 2014 (World
Health Organisation, 2016), a condition that is a major risk
factor for noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular
conditions and stroke (Grover et al., 2015). Physical
inactivity has been identified as a main contributor to the
obesity epidemic, due to the structure of work and transport
become more sedentary in nature (WHO, 2004). People
mostly agree explicitly that physical activity is good for
health, but in the UK, about 40% of adults still do not
achieve minimum recommended levels of physical activity
in their daily life (Craig & Mindell, 2012). While there may
be various reasons for this discrepancy between attitudes
and behaviour, closing the gap by increasing physical
activity remains an important applied challenge.
The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH, 2016)
recently proposed to target obesity in the UK by the
introduction of food labels that reflect the amount of
physical activity required to burn off calories in the food.
This label is intended to be easier to understand and to
nudge people into exercising more. In this project, we assess
which aspect of the new label would increase physical
activities. We propose some hypotheses about the effect of
using the concept of exercise instead of calories to represent
food energy, and presenting an image instead of a text. We
posit that mentioning exercise instead of calories could act
as a semantic prime that increases the accessibility of

activity-related thoughts (Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971) and
therefore the intention to engage in physical activities.
Compared to text, using an image may also influence the
meta-cognitive processes involved in processing the label.
Research suggests that the distinctive nature of pictures
enhance their recollection over words (Curran & Doyle,
2011), may generate more interactive information
processing (Domke, Perlmutter, & Spratt, 2002), and are
superior to words in activating conceptual understanding
(McBride & Dosher, 2002). Images of a concept are thus
more likely to increase its mental accessibility, priming it to
be processed more quickly, or more ‘fluently’ when next
encountered.
Concepts that have been activated are subsequently
perceived more easily (i.e. more fluent) and are better liked
(Winkielman, Schwarz, Reber, & Fazendeiro, 2000).
Factors that increase perceptual fluency, such as improved
clarity of presentation, also increase liking of stimuli
(Oppenheimer, 2008). Notably, exercise that was presented
in a passage with easy-to-read font (high fluency) was
estimated to take less effort to perform than when the font
was illegible (low fluency) and this influenced people’s
willingness to engage in it (Song & Schwarz, 2008).
Manipulating the accessibility of different options has
also shown positive effects on healthy related behaviours.
Environmental cues can increase the salience of healthy
choices and subtly prime people to view these options more
favourably (Marteau, 2011; Wilson, Buckley, Buckley, &
Bogomolova, 2016). For example, placing fruit instead of
chocolate snacks at supermarket checkouts increased
purchase of the healthier food options (Foster et al., 2014).
Featuring healthier sandwiches in a more prominent and
unhealthier ones in a less prominent spot on a menu made
people more likely to order the healthy sandwiches
(Wisdom, Downs, & Loewenstein, 2010).
In sum, variables that increase perceptual fluency (such as
familiarity and clarity) as well as variables that increase
conceptual fluency (such as exposure to associatively
related concepts) can influence the subjective ease with
which a stimulus can be processed. We therefore
hypothesised that image and activity labels would result in
greater mental availability of exercise than text and calorie
labels. Additionally, image and activity labels would result
in exercise being rated as less effortful and more enjoyable,
leading to greater willingness to engage in exercise
behaviours than with text and calorie labels.

and how enjoyable they thought it would be on a 5-point
Likert scale (1: not at all, 5: extremely).

One hundred and forty-two English-speaking participants
were recruited online through snowball sampling in the UK
and Singapore, and sharing through social networking sites
and online forums. Age ranged from 18 to 74 years (M =
40.30, SD = 15.47). Ethnicity was 58% Asian and 23%
percent white/Caucasian (19% other races). Body Mass
Index (BMI) estimates based on weight and height
categories of participants ranged from 15.82 to 43.51 (M =
22.501, SD = 4.66).

Exercise intentions In addition to direct questions about
their intentions to exercise (defined as a sustained period of
activity of at least 10 minutes) in the next week (likelihood
and duration), participants were also given a role-play
scenario where they could decide between a sedentary or
active option to carry out the scenario task. For example,
‘You leave your [2nd storey] flat and must go downstairs.
You can either take the lift or the stairs. Both are equally
accessible from your door. Which would you choose?’
Participants’ answers in this role-play scenario were scored
on a 6-point scale between sedentary and active options (1:
sedentary, 6: active). This was averaged to create an overall
score for active choices.

Participants

Materials1
Food labels We manipulated label format (image vs. text)
and energy representation (activity vs. calorie) to create four
labels as shown in Figure 1. The image labels were derived
from existing activity-label depictions that have been
proposed and tested in previous research (e.g. Swartz,
Dowray, Braxton, Mihas, & Viera, 2013; Van Kleef, Van
Trijp, Paeps, & Fernandez-Celemin, 2008). In order to keep
image quality consistent, we standardised the walking image
across both activity-image and calorie-image labels.
Equivalent activity values were calculated from the chosen
calorie value based on the mean weight of a UK individual
(70kg).

Procedure
The experiment was delivered online via Qualtrics survey
platform. Participants were randomly assigned to view one
of the four labels and they answered filler questions about
the labels to ensure that they processed it. Then the
participants took the word fragment completion task
presented as part of a separate study on language ability.
After this, they completed the measures for perceptions of
exercise, followed by the role-play and direct questions
about their exercise intentions. Finally, they provided
demographic information, which included scales assessing
attitudes towards health (Steptoe, Pollard, & Wardle, 1995)
and exercise (Courneya, Conner, & Rhodes, 2006).

Results
The dependent variables in the experiment were analysed in
a MANOVA with energy representation and label format as
independent variables.

Figure 1: Labels used as stimuli.
Word fragment completion task Participants read 17 word
fragments, of which 12 could be completed with either
exercise-related or neutral words. For example, the fragment
‘S _ ORT’ could be completed as SPORT (exercise-related)
or SHORT (unrelated). This type of task has previously
been used as a measure of mental availability (Tulving,
Schacter, & Stark, 1982). The fragments were chosen to
keep the overall word frequency for potential completions
as balanced as possible. Each word fragment was presented
on a separate page. Participants were told that both speed
and accuracy were important in the task.

Mental availability of exercise As shown in Figure 2, more
exercise-related word completions were observed for
activity than calorie labels, F(1, 124) = 3.94, p = .049, η2p =
.03. Label format had no significant effect on number of
exercise-related words produced, F(1, 124) = .17, p = .682,
η2p < .01. The interaction was not significant, F(1, 124) =
.12, p = .730, η2p < .01.

Perception of exercise
We
measured
participants’
perception of exercise as an indicator of exercise
favourability. Participants were asked to imagine they had
agreed to go for a 5km walk with their neighbour, and
indicate how long (on a slider scale from 0 to 120 minutes)

standard deviations above the mean.) The resulting
distribution is shown in Figure 4.
The analyses showed no significant effect of label
conditions on scores for active choice, F(3, 124) = .37, p =
.776, η2p = .01. However, we found that energy and format
interacted to determine intention to exercise. In the activity
condition, choices and intentions to exercise were greater
when viewing images, but in the calorie condition, they
were higher when viewing text, F(1, 124) = 8.14, p = .005,
η2p = .06. The individual main effects were not significant
(energy, F(1, 124) = .29, p = .591, η2p < .01; format, F(1,
124) = .77, p = .382, η2p < .01).

and 95% confidence intervals.
Perception of exercise As shown in Figure 3, in the calorie
condition, images led to higher walk estimates (suggesting
greater perceived effort) than text, but the reverse was true
in the activity condition, F(1, 124) = 3.94, p = .049, η2p =
.03. Both main effects were not significant (energy, F(1,
124) = .01, p .941, η2p < .01; format, F(1, 124) = .37, p =
.546, η2p < .01). The MANOVA found no significant effect
on enjoyability ratings, F(3, 124) = 1.24, p = .300, η2p = .03.

Exercise intentions Participants’ estimates of exercise time
per day were multiplied by their judgements of exercise
likelihood to form a combined measure for intention to
exercise. We excluded 15 extreme scores with estimated
intention to exercise of 10 hours or more (more than 1.5

We replicated the MANOVA with age, BMI, and attitudes
towards health and exercise. The analysis showed that the
interaction effect for label format and energy on exercise
intentions remained significant, F(1, 117) = 6.43, p = .013,
η2p = .05. The effect of energy on number of exerciserelated word completions and interaction effects for
perception of exercise was no longer significant, F(1, 117) =
2.75, p = .100, η2p = .03; F(1, 117) = 3.75, p = .055, η2p =
.03). The effects of the covariates on the dependent
variables were also non-significant (age, F(5, 113) = .66, p
= .652, η2p = .03; BMI, F(5, 113) = .28, p = .922, η2p = .01;
health attitude, F(5, 113) = .06, p = .255, η2p = .06; exercise
attitude, F(5, 113) = .04, p = .422, η2p = .04). We also
analysed the effect of ethnicity. While Asian participants
were less likely in general to pick active options in the
scenario-based tasks, F(3, 112) = 3.58, p = .016, η2p = .09,
using Pillai’s trace, we found no other main effects or
interactions of ethnicity with label format, F(10, 218) =
1.16, p = .317, η2p = .05 or energy representation, F(10, 218)
= .97, p = .47, η2p = .04.

Discussion
Two aspects of food labels were examined for their ability
to increase intentions for exercise: representing food energy
value in terms of activity time instead of calories, and using
images instead of text. Building on empirical findings that
greater perceptual and conceptual fluency from prior
exposure increases liking, it was predicted that image and
activity labels would prime greater mental availability of
exercise and thus increase intentions to exercise. No
significant main effects of label format were found, however
calorie labels generated more exercise-related word
completions. Exercise was perceived as more effortful for
calorie labels in image format, but more effortful for activity
labels in text format. For activity labels, intentions to
exercise were greater for image than text formats, but the
opposite was true for calorie labels.
It has been demonstrated that priming effects in word
fragment completions occur when semantic information
about the prime is retrieved (Smith, 1991), which we
hypothesised to be facilitated by the perceptual and
conceptual fluency of image and activity labels. However,
we found instead a higher number of exercise-related words
generated in calorie condition. It therefore seems propitious
to consider what concepts are primed by the idea of calories.
This term has been used as the current standard to represent
energy values on packaged food for several decades
(Wartella, Lichtenstein, & Boon, 2010), and is also
frequently associated with dieting and weight loss in
popular media and health communications (e.g. Department
of Health, 2015). While we assumed that people would have
a more intuitive understanding of activity than calories,
experience dealing with less intuitive but common
conceptual representations may also affect semantic
associations. For example, more people associate sugar
amounts with grams instead of teaspoons, despite the latter
being a more intuitive measurement (Vanderlee, White,
Bordes, Hobin, & Hammond, 2015). We cannot rule out
that repeated exposure to calories in the context of exercise
allowed participants to automatically generate the concept
of exercise from viewing calorie labels.
The finding that format did not affect mental availability
or intended behaviours directly, but had different effects
depending on whether an activity or calorie label was
presented, was unexpected. We speculate that activity and
calorie labels have a processing advantage in image and text
form respectively. Activity image labels are suggested to be
visually and conceptually easier to understand (Campos,
Doxey, & Hammond, 2011), but the relative familiarity of
calorie text labels (as opposed to calorie image ones)
enhances its ease of processing (Zajonc, 1968). Since both
calorie and activity labels showed an ability to prime
exercise-related words, it is possible that the relative
processing ease of activity image and calorie text labels
further increased their fluency over activity text and calorie
image labels and therefore the fluency of exercise associated
with the label. This would subsequently drive more
favourable emotions towards exercise (Song & Schwarz,

2008) and explain the increased intentions to exercise in
these conditions.
Practically, our results replicated previous survey findings
of increased intentions to perform exercise after viewing
activity labels (RSPH, 2016) for image labels but not for
text labels, where calories outperformed activity. Overall,
our data indicate that activity labels did not meeting the
expectations of the RSPH, albeit with small effect sizes.
Nonetheless, we question whether swapping existing
calorie-based food labels for activity equivalent ones would
be a wise investment. The use of images with the activity
labels may generate a greater influence on people’s
association of energy with exercise over time, since pictures
have been shown to improve memory performance over
repeated trials more than words (Erdelyi & Becker, 1974).
However it is uncertain how long this effect would need to
take hold in the population, or whether it would even
surpass the current greater ability of calories than activity to
generate exercise associations in text format.
However, before condemning activity labels, it would be
prudent to compare activity and calorie labels to a control
condition to determine if the mere presence of either label is
indeed sufficient to prime exercise concepts and related
behaviours. Previous work has indicated that the presence of
either label on a menu can reduce energy ordered compared
to a no-label condition (James, Adams-Huet, & Shah, 2015),
with activity labels being slightly (but not significantly)
more effective than calorie labels. This also suggests that
the effects of labels could extend beyond participants’
intentions to influence their behaviour, which is not a
foregone conclusion from our results. Indeed, a gap between
intentions and behaviour often exists, especially for
exercise-related behaviours (Sniehotta, Scholz, &
Schwarzer, 2005). The reporting of exercise intentions
needs to be interpreted with caution, especially given the
possibility that the social desirability of physical activity
may prompt participants to overestimate their exercise
intentions—although such an effect is likely to be consistent
across experimental manipulations. Nevertheless, future
research would do well to include measures that provide a
more reliable indication of participants’ actual exercise and
food choice behaviours post exposure to different labels.
Further research should also look to replicate results with
a variety of image samples for more robust consideration of
the different types of activity images, as well as on a sample
with more varied income and literacy levels. In our sample,
nearly all respondents had completed tertiary education,
which is often an indicator of higher literacy and income
(McCoy, 2013). Groups with low literacy or income
understand nutrition labels less well and are less familiar
with calories, all of which could affect label fluency (for
familiarity with calories, see Bleich & Pollack, 2010; for
income, see Rothman et al., 2006, also Viswanathan, Hastak
& Gau, 2009; for literacy, see Signal et al., 2008).
Nevertheless, our study demonstrates the importance of
psychological research in informing policy decisions and
population-level health interventions.
