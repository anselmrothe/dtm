Results
  Aggregated and individual response patterns are plotted
in Figures 3 and 4. As can be seen, there was a strong
pattern, overall, of attraction toward the center of the
distribution. However, this was tempered by strong
outward trends among most individuals. These outward
biases tended to be moderately strong, roughly
comparable in size to the bias toward the center, and in
some cases dominating it. Figure 3 shows the aggregated
model fits across participants; Figure 4 the individual fits.
