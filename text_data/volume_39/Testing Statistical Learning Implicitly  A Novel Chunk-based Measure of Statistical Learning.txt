Procedure The experiment consisted of three distinct tasks.
First, subjects were familiarized with the artificial language.
To ensure active engagement, a cover task based on Arciuli
& Simpson (2012) was administered. In addition to each of
the six words in the experiment, three variants of each word
containing a syllable repetition was included in the training
stream (e.g., tagalu → tatagalu, tagagalu, tagalulu).
Participants were instructed to click the space bar when they
noticed a repeated syllable. Each of the three variants of the       b)
words appeared 4 times, yielding 72 repetitions. In total,
training lasted 11 minutes.
   After training, participants’ knowledge of the artificial
language was tested using both the standard 2AFC task, and
our SICR paradigm. The order of these two tasks was
counterbalanced such that half of the subjects were given
2AFC first, and half were given SICR first. In the 2AFC
task, each of the 6 target words were aurally presented with
one of the 6 2AFC foil words, and subjects were asked to
report which of the two trigrams had been present during
training. There were 36 2AFC trials in all, in which each
target word appeared alongside each foil once.                      Figure 1: a) Average SICR performance. Participants recall
