Figure 1. Illustration of how the strength of intuitions might
change over time. The y-axis represents the activation strength
while the x-axis represents time. I1 and I2 represent the two cued
intuitions. Note that in the BR-S condition I1 is the logical intuition
cued by the base rate probabilities, while I2 is the heuristic intuition
cued by the stereotypes. Consequently, in the S-BR condition, I1 is
the heuristic and I2 is the logical intuition. T1 and T2 represent the
time of initial and final response, respectively.
