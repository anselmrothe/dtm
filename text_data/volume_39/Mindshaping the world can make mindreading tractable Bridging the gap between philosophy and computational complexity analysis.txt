   The solution for tractable mindreading lies “not within
human mind readers, but, rather, outside of them" (Zawidzki,
2009). The idea is promising, since it is known that some
intractable functions f:I→O can be tractable when their input
domain is constrained f’:I’→O, where I’⊂I (Downey &
Fellows, 1999; van Rooij, 2008). These constraints can be the
