   Palmer and Brewer (2012) sought to address the need for
formal modelling of the lineup task by fitting a SDT                      Figure1: Basic representation of the unequal variance
compound detection model (SDT-CD; Duncan, 2006) to a                                     signal detection model
corpus of studies that compared simultaneous and sequential
lineup data. The ‘compound’ aspect of SDT-CD refers to
the fact that a lineup can be decomposed into two decision
tasks; target detection (is the target present?) and target
identification (if the target is present, which member is the
target?). Results showed that the simultaneous and
sequential lineups did not significantly differ in terms of
discriminability but that the sequential procedure led to
more conservative responding.
   However, there were critical aspects of the analyses
conducted by Palmer and Brewer (2012) that may have
affected their results. First, the SDT-CD model was
developed to account for simultaneous presentation of
stimuli – it does not directly model the sequential procedure.
For this reason, we develop and apply a formal model of the
sequential procedure. Second, the best-fitting parameter
