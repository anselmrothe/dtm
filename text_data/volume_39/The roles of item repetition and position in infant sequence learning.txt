Abstract
We examined mechanisms underlying infants’ ability to
detect, extract, and generalize sequential patterns, focusing on
how saliency and consistency of distributional information
guide infant learning of the most “likely” pattern in
audiovisual sequences. In Experiment 1, we asked if 11- and
14-month-old infants could learn a “repetition anywhere” rule
(e.g., ABBC, AABC, ABCC). In Experiment 2 we asked if
11- and 14-month-olds could generalize a “medial repetition”
rule when its position is consistent in sequence, and in
Experiment 3 we asked if 11-month-olds could identify a
nonadjacent dependency occurring at edge positions. Infants
were first habituated to 4-item sequences (shapes + syllables)
containing repetition- and/or position-based structure, and
were then tested with “familiar” structure instantiated across
new items or combinations of items vs. “novel” (random)
sequences. We found that 11-month-olds failed to learn the
repetition rule both when the structure appeared in initial,
medial, or final position (Experiment 1) and when it was
restricted to the medial position (Experiment 2). Fourteenmonth-olds learned repetition rules under both conditions.
Finally, in Experiment 3 11-month-olds succeeded in learning
a nonadjacent dependency in sequences identical to those
used to test repetition learning in Experiment 2. Our results
suggest that infants at 11 months, like adults, are relatively
insensitive to patterns in the middle of sequences.

Introduction
In the present paper, we examine mechanisms underlying
infants’ ability to detect, extract, and generalize sequential
patterns. Sequence learning is essential for processes
ranging from the acquisition of language to everyday
activities such as preparing for bed, learning to count,
learning to read, and getting ready for school. Insights into
development of sequence learning in infancy, therefore, are
vital for theories of developmental and cognitive function
across a variety of domains.
What kinds of learning mechanisms are available to
infants, and what are the limits of these mechanisms? Our
particular focus is on two means of knowledge acquisition,
“statistical learning” and “rule learning”: the extent to which
infants can use transitional probability information among
items to extract units from an unbroken stream of stimuli

(e.g., Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996) or the extent to
which infants can distinguish simple reduplicative patterns
from one another (e.g., Gerken, 2006; Marcus, Vijayan,
Rao, & Vishton, 1999), respectively. Sequence learning is
guided by multiple mechanisms (Arciuli, 2017; Krogh,
Vlach, & Johnson, 2013; Thiessen, Kronstein, & Hufnagle,
2013), and its development in infancy can be better
understood by investigations of the salience and consistency
of statistical and rule-governed structures (Aslin &
Newport, 2012, 2014). Some structures, such as identity
relations or positions of items in order, might serve as
“perceptual primitives,” processed by specialized
mechanisms to detect and remember specific features in
patterned sequences (Endress, Nespor, & Mehler, 2009).
The Saffran et al. (1996) transitional probability task, a
well-known example of statistical learning, presented 8month-olds an auditory stimulus consisting of four unique
strings (e.g., tupiro, golabu, bidaku, and padoti) presented in
random order as a continuous, unsegmented stream for 2
minutes. Infants then heard isolated strings in repetition
(e.g., tupiro, tupiro, tupiro…) alternating with “part-word”
strings composed of parts of two of the familiar words (e.g.,
rogola, rogola…) from a speaker located either to the left or
right. Infants exhibited a postfamiliarization novelty
preference for the part-words relative to the words, implying
that they detected the differences in transitional probability
across word boundaries in the input sequence.
Rule learning in sequential patterns was assessed by
Marcus et al. (1999), who exposed 7-month-olds to strings
that followed either an “ABA” pattern (e.g., gah tee gah) or
an “ABB” pattern (e.g., gah tee tee). After 2 minutes of
exposure, the infants heard the same (familiar) pattern
instantiated by different phonemes (e.g., woh fei woh, dee
koh dee), and a second (novel) pattern on alternating trials
and showed a preference for the novel, a result that extended
to a test of ABB vs. AAB. Because transitional probabilities
between test-string syllables were zero, performance could
not have been based on statistical learning.
Studies of infant rule learning have produced mixed
results with respect to the learnability of a simple repetition
rule (adjacent, as in AAB or ABB, or nonadjacent, as in
ABA). Overall, the findings of these experiments seem to

3089

differ based on how familiar the infants may be with the
stimuli: 7-month-olds successfully learn ABA vs. ABB,
ABB vs. AAB, and AAB vs. ABB patterns when the stimuli
are auditory (Marcus et al., 1999, 2007) or familiar visual
stimuli (e.g., faces and animals; Bulf et al., 2015; Saffran et
al., 2007). However, when stimuli consist of sequences of
colored shapes, learning seems to be more difficult, perhaps
because learning visual sequential input is constrained by
limits in visual working memory (Johnson et al., 2009). In
this case, 8-month-olds learned a late repetition rule
(adjacent repetition in the final edge position) when tested
vs. nonadjacent repetition (ABB vs. ABA), but failed to
learn late vs. early repetition (ABB vs. AAB), early vs.
nonadjacent repetition (AAB vs. ABA), and nonadjacent vs.
late repetition (ABA vs. ABB). Eleven-month-olds learned
all these rules except nonadjacent vs. late repetition.
Adults’ learning of repetition-based structure also appears
to be constrained by position (Endress, Scholl, & Mehler;
2005): Adults discriminated seven-syllable sequences from
sequences of new items based on differences in internal vs.
edge repetitions (e.g., ABCDDEF vs. ABCDEFF), but could
only generalize when given edge repetitions. In summary,
repetition structures in edge positions appear to be reliably
learned by both infants and adults, but learnability of
internal repetitions remains unknown for infants because the
structures tested in previous structural learning studies only
involved repetitions located at either the initial or final edge
of the sequence (AAB, ABA, and ABB).
In Experiment 1, we asked if 11- and 14-month-olds can
detect, extract, and generalize a “repetition anywhere” rule
(i.e., ABBC, AABC, ABCC). If infants detect repetition of
items during a learning phase, they may subsequently
recognize repetitions of new items (in new sequences),
which we take as evidence for generalization. However, it
may be that consistent position information is a key part of
repetition learning at this age, as it appears to be for adults;
in this case, variability in the position of the repetition might
pose difficulty in its identification and recall.
In Experiment 2, we used a sequence with two possible
underlying patterns to examine how consistency and
salience contribute to sequence learning. In this experiment,
we asked whether 11 and 14-month-olds could generalize a
“medial repetition” rule when its position is consistent in
sequence, but not at an edge. In Experiment 3, using the
same sequence types as Experiment 2, we asked whether
11-month-olds could identify a nonadjacent dependency
occurring at initial and final edge positions that may be
more salient than the medial position of the repetition.
In all experiments we used an intermodal presentation
method in which looming shapes were accompanied by
spoken syllables, a method known to facilitate rule learning,
relative to visual or auditory only, in 5- and 7-month-olds
(Frank, Slemmer, Marcus, & Johnson, 2009; Thiessen,
2012). Because infants as young as newborns look longer at
randomly-ordered shape sequences vs. sequences with
statistical structure (Addyman & Mareschal, 2013; Bulf,
Johnson, & Valenza, 2011; Kirkham, Slemmer, & Johnson,

2002), we reasoned that longer looking at novel vs. familiar
sequences (i.e., random vs. structured, respectively) in the
current studies would reflect learning and/or generalization
of structural and/or statistical structure during habituation.

Experiment 1
Method
Participants Twenty 11-month-olds (Mage = 11.25 months;
SD = .297; 8 girls) and 20 14-month-olds (Mage = 14.20
months; SD = .313; 9 girls) participated. An additional ten
11-month-olds were tested but excluded for failure to
habituate (7), fussiness (2), or preterm birth (1). an
additional twelve 14-month-olds were tested but excluded
for failure to habituate (8) or fussiness (4).
Materials and Apparatus Visual stimuli consisted of 18
colored shapes (see Figure 1). Auditory stimuli consisted of
an inventory of 18 spoken syllables produced with a speech
synthesizer and identical to those used in Marcus et al.
(1999) (e.g., bah, dee, doo, gei, jai, jah, kei, poh).

Figure 1: Schematic depiction of example habituation and
test sequences for Experiment 1.
Shape-syllable pairings were determined randomly (see
Figure 1). Sequences were assembled from a randomly
chosen set of nine (out of the total 18) shape-syllable
combinations (hereafter called “items” for simplicity), so
that three items composed each four-item sequence by
repeating one of the three items, either the first, second, or
third (determined randomly) to yield a repetition in the
initial, medial, or final position. Items always appeared in
the same order within each habituation sequence.
Procedure Stimuli were presented using Macromedia
Director on a Macintosh computer and a 53 cm color screen.
In a separate room, the experimenter used closed-circuit
video to view the infant and record his or her looking times
during the experiment; the experimenter was blind to what
was being presented on the screen. Before each habituation
trial, a visual attention-getter appeared in the center of the
screen to draw the infant’s attention. Each shape was
presented on a black background and increased in size from
4 cm to 24 cm high (2.4-14.6˚ visual angle) over a period of
667 ms; onset of syllables (M duration 338 ms) was
coincident with the appearance of each shape. Thus each
sequence was 2 s long, and sequences were separated by a
667 ms black screen. The 4-item sequences were randomly
displayed one after another with no immediate repetition of
any specific sequence. When the mean looking time over

3090

four consecutive trials fell to less than 50% compared to the
mean looking time for the first four habituation trials (i.e.,
habituation) infants viewed the test sequences.
At test, infants viewed “familiar” and “novel” four-item
sequences drawn from the remaining nine in the total
inventory that were not shown during habituation. Familiar
test sequences followed the same constraints as those
described previously for the habituation sequences. Novel
test sequences were composed of the same nine items,
presented in sequences of four, and random ordering of
items with no constraints except no repeated items in any
single sequence. Infants viewed six alternating familiar and
novel trials presented in pairs (i.e., three test trial blocks),
and viewing order was counterbalanced such that half the
infants viewed a familiar trial first (followed by a novel
trial) and half the infants viewed a novel trial first (followed
by a familiar trial). Preliminary analyses examining sex
differences in performance revealed no reliable effects in
any of the experiments in this report (all ps > .05).

Results and Discussion
A 2 (age group) x 2 (trial type – novel or familiar) x 2 (order
– novel or familiar first) x 3 (test trial block) mixed
ANOVA on posthabituation looking times revealed a main
effect of test trial block, F(2, 72) = 4.79, p = .011, η2p = .12,
the result of a decline in looking across trials, and an age
group x trial type interaction, F(1, 36) = 8.03, p = .008, η2p
= .182. There were no other significant effects. Follow-up ttests indicated that 11-month-olds did not look differently to
novel and familiar test stimuli, t(19) = -.916, p = .371, ns,
but 14-month-olds looked longer at novel vs. familiar
sequences, t(19) = 3.06, p = .006 . Thus 11-month-olds
provided no evidence for learning a “repetition anywhere”
rule, whereas 14-month-olds appeared to do so.

Materials and Apparatus The item stimuli and
presentation apparatus were the same as in Experiment 1.
Habituation sequences contained both a medial repetition
and a nonadjacent dependency between the first and fourth
items of the sequence (see Figure 2). Sequences were
assembled from a randomly chosen set of ten from the
inventory of 18. Again, three items composed each fouritem sequence, but the second item was always repeated,
instantiating a medial repetition rule. Four items were
selected (from the ten) for first and fourth positions in two
unique sequences, and three items were selected for the
medial positions in each sequence (e.g., ABBC, DEEF,
AGGC, DHHF, etc.). The two sequences were presented in
alternation during habituation.
The test sequences were constructed such that familiar
sequences tested the generalization of the medial repetition
rule with new exemplars that did not use consistent
shapes/syllables in the first and fourth positions across
sequences. Familiar sequences were composed of items
drawn from the entire shape inventory, with the constraints
that the second item always repeated, and the first and
fourth items in sequence could not be one of the four items
that occupied those positions in the habituation sequences.
The novel sequences followed the same constraints
described in Experiment 1.

Experiment 2
Because 11-month-olds showed no evidence of learning
repetitions in variable locations in Experiment 1, in
Experiment 2 we examined the role of positional
consistency in sequence learning. Here, we tested 11 and
14-month-olds’ learning of a medial repetition rule.
Habituation sequences comprised two different patterns that
could be extracted: a medial repetition rule (a changing
identity in the AxxC pattern), and a nonadjacent dependency
(between A and C in the AxxC pattern). Experiment 2
specifically tested rule learning, and as in Experiment 1, we
reasoned that this learning would be reflected in longer
looking during novel vs. familiar test trials.

Method
Participants Twenty 11-month-olds (Mage = 11.15 months,
SD = .34; 14 girls) and twenty 14-month-olds (Mage = 14.14
months, SD = .39; 9 girls) participated in Experiment 2. Six
additional 11-month-olds were tested but excluded for
failure to habituate (4) or fussiness (2). Eight additional 14month-olds were tested but excluded due to failure to
habituate (2), technical error (2), or fussiness (4).

Figure 2: Schematic depiction of example habituation and
test sequences for Experiments 2 and 3.
Procedure The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1.
Infants were habituated to sequences that contained a medial
repetition and a nonadjacent dependency (described above),
and an infant-controlled habituation paradigm was used. At
test, infants saw six trials that alternated between familiar
(i.e., contained a medial repetition) and novel, viewing three
of each trial type in total. Infants were randomly assigned to
see either a familiar trial or a novel trial first.

Results and Discussion
A 2 (age group) x 2 (trial type) x 3 (test trial block) mixed
ANOVA revealed a significant 3-way interaction, F(2, 76) =

3091

5.71, p = .022, η2p = .13, which stemmed from a relatively
precipitous decline in looking across novel trials by older
infants but not younger infants. More importantly, there was
an age x trial type interaction, F(1, 38) = 7.42, p .= 010, η2p
= .16, due to differences in looking at novel and familiar test
sequences. Although this analysis yielded a significant main
effect of trial type, F(1, 38) = 4.36, p = .044, η2p = .10, this
effect was driven by 14-month-olds’ longer looking to novel
test trials, as 11-month-olds looked equally to novel and
familiar test trials. There was also a significant main effect
of test trial block, F(2, 76) = 25.11, p < .001, η2p = .40, due
to a decline in looking times across trials.
14 Month Olds A 2 (trial type) x 2 (order) x 3 (test trial
block) mixed ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of
trial type, F(1, 18) = 8.20, p = .010, η2p = .313, due to longer
looking overall at the novel test sequence. There was also a
reliable main effect of test trial block, F(2, 36) = 22.37, p <
.001, η2p = .55, due to a decline in looking across trials.
These main effects were qualified by a significant trial type
x test trial block interaction, F(2, 36) = 10.70, p = .004, η2p =
.37 and a significant trial type x order x test trial block
interaction, F(2, 36) = 9.25, p = .007, η2p = .34. There were
no other significant effects. The two higher-order
interactions were a result of longer looking during the first
trial block toward the novel sequence by infants in the
novel-first order, relative to infants in the familiar-first
order, t(18) = 2.29, p = .034; comparisons across the second
and third trial blocks were ns, ps > .16.
11 Month Olds A 2 (trial type) x 2 (order) x 3 (test trial
block) mixed ANOVA yielded a main effect of test trial
block, F(2, 36) = 5.50, p = .031, η2p = .23, the result of a
decline in looking across trials, and a significant trial type x
order interaction, F(1, 18) = 6.44, p = .021, η2p = .23, due to
a (nonsignificant) tendency for infants in both order
conditions to look longer at the trial type that was presented
first. There were no other significant effects; the trial type
effect was ns at p = .364. These results support the
conclusion that the 14-month-olds generalized the medial
repetition rule, whereas the 11-month-olds did not.

Experiment 3
Because 11-month-olds failed to learn the “medial
repetition” rule in Experiment 2, Experiment 3 addressed
the possibility that learning structures in 4-item sequences is
too difficult for 11-month-olds, perhaps due to limits in
visual working memory. We used the same habituation
sequences as Experiment 2 but instead tested for statistical
learning (specifically, the nonadjacent dependency between
A and C in the AxxC pattern). As in previous experiments,
we reasoned that this learning would be reflected in longer
looking during novel vs. familiar test trials.

Method
Participants Twenty 11-month-olds (Mage = 11.16 months,
SD = .32; 6 girls) participated in Experiment 3. An
additional nine infants were tested but excluded due to
failure to habituate (8) or fussiness (1).

Materials and Apparatus The item stimuli and
presentation apparatus were the same as in Experiments 1
and 2.
Procedure The procedure was the same as in Experiment 2,
except for the structure of the test sequences. The familiar
test trials maintained the relation between the first and
fourth items across two sequences, using the exact same
first and fourth items from habituation, but had no
repetitions (i.e., each familiar sequence was composed of
four unique items; see Figure 2). The novel test trials
followed constraints described previously.

Results and Discussion
A 2 (trial type) x 2 (order) x 3 (test trial block) mixed
ANOVA yielded a reliable main effect of trial type, F(1, 18)
= 7.86, p = .012, η2p = .30, due to longer looking overall at
novel vs. familiar test sequences (see Figure 4). There was
also a main effect of trial block, F(2, 36) = 7.82, p = .012,
η2p = .30, due to a decline in looking across trials, and a
significant interaction between trial block and trial type,
F(2, 36) = 9.63, p = .006, η2p = .35. Infants looked more
toward the novel sequence than the familiar in the first
block, t(19) = 2.75, p = .013, and in the second block, t(19)
= 2.80, p = .011, but not in the third block, t(19) = .22, ns.
The overall presence of a novelty preference suggests that
infants abstracted the nonadjacent dependency pattern
during habituation.
We compared performance of the 11-month-olds in
Experiments 2 and 3 with a 2 (experiment) x 2 (trial type) x
3 (test trial block) mixed ANOVA. This analysis revealed a
significant main effect of test trial block, F(2, 76) = 11.44, p
< .001, η2p = .23, due to a decline in looking times across
trials. More importantly, there was an experiment x trial
type interaction, F(1, 38) = 6.83, p = .013, η2p = .15, due to
differences in looking at novel and familiar test sequences,
as noted earlier. Taken together, therefore, the results of
Experiments 2 and 3 provide evidence that when both
statistical and rule-bound information was available in
habituation sequences, 11-month-olds detected the presence
or absence of nonadjacent dependencies (ordinal positions
of initial and final shapes in sequence; i.e., statistical
information) across habituation and test, but not a medial
repetition (i.e., rule-bound information).

General Discussion
In a departure from past studies showing that 11-month-olds
learn an adjacent repetition rule when the repetition appears
in the initial or final positions in sequence (Johnson et al.,
2009), we discovered that 11-month-olds failed to learn this
rule when the repetition appeared in any position (initial,
medial, or final, Experiment 1), or when it was restricted to
the medial position (Experiment 2). Fourteen-month-olds,
however, appeared to learn repetition rules under both
conditions. Finally, in Experiment 3, 11-month-olds
succeeded in learning a nonadjacent dependency in
sequences identical to those used in Experiment 2. We
conclude that 11-month-old infants do not seem to

3092

recognize repetitions when they appear in multiple positions
in sequence, or in a consistent middle position, although
items at edge positions in sequence appear to be distinctly
salient. Similar findings for adults were reported by Endress
et al. (2005, 2010).

Repetition and Position as Perceptual Primitives
Infant sequence learning is constrained by saliency and
consistency of information well as general limits in attention
and memory (Aslin & Newport, 2012, 2014). Some of these
constraints are specific to modality (e.g., speech cues;
Johnson & Jusczyk, 2001; Thiessen & Saffran, 2003) or the
experimental setting (e.g., gaze or action cues; Baldwin,
Andersson, Saffran, & Meyer, 2008), but others, such as
repetition and position, are domain-general and may operate
similarly across contexts. Evidence from the 11-month-olds
in Experiment 2 is consistent with findings from adults, who
generalized a repetition to new items when it appeared in
final position, but not a medial position, in 7-item syllable
sequences (Endress et al., 2005). These studies suggest that
item position, most notably final position, is more salient
than item repetition, relatively speaking; these findings are
consistent with the well-documented serial position curve
(Ebbinghaus, 1885) and the recency effect in memory
(Baddeley & Hitch, 1974)
Because any particular set of items in a group potentially
supports an infinite number of possible structures and
generalizations thereof, a learner must determine the most
likely pattern given a limited amount of experience with it.
One way in which this problem may be constrained is by a
“gradient of generalization:” the most consistent
information across a distribution produces the best learning
(Aslin & Newport, 2014; Gerken, 2006). In Experiments 2
and 3, information for medial repetition and nonadjacent
dependency was available, yet 11-month-olds learned only
the statistical information. Notably, 14-month-olds appeared
to learn a repetition rule both when it was restricted to the
medial position (Experiment 2) and when it was free to
appear in initial, medial, or final position (Experiment 1),
implying that important developments in structural learning
consist of the “separation” of perceptual primitives such that
they become less interdependent and perhaps more salient
on their own.

Infant Sequence Learning in Context
Rule learning and generalization for shorter sequences can
be observed in infants as young as 4 months (Dawson &
Gerken, 2009). Rule learning in 5-month-olds from 3-item
shape-syllable sequences was also reported, using a similar
design (Frank et al., 2009). Studies that tested for statistical
learning reported that 3-month-olds appeared to recognize
violations of serial order in 3-item shape-sound sequences
(Lewkowicz, 2008), and 5-month-olds segmented shape
sequences from differences in transitional probability
(Marcovitch & Lewkowicz, 2009; Slone & Johnson, 2015).
(To our knowledge, there is no published evidence for rule
or statistical learning in auditory or visual sequences prior to

4 months.) By 8 months, infants seem to use a “chunking”
mechanism to segment shape sequences when tested for
learning of “illusory” sequences or “embedded” units in
streams of looming shapes (Slone & Johnson, 2016; cf.
Endress & Mehler, 2009; Giroux & Rey, 2009).
Finally, consider the findings (from Experiments 2 and 3)
that 11-month-olds extracted statistical patterns, but not
rules, from identical sequences. In a previous test of
multiple pattern learning, adults listened to speech streams
that could be interpreted in terms of rules or statistical
relations (Endress & Bonatti, 2007). With briefer listening
times, participants learned the rules, but did not identify the
statistical structure without substantially longer exposure
durations. This result led to the claim that there is a fastworking mechanism for extracting rule-bound patterns, and
a second slower mechanism that requires additional time to
learn associations among items. Yet the infants we observed
appeared to learn statistical relations, but not rules, during a
relatively brief period of habituation. The reasons for this
effect are unclear. Recently, 8-month-old infants were found
to learn different statistical structures (transitional
probabilities and “chunks” of items) as a function of
exposure time (Slone & Johnson, 2016), and it may be that
11-month-olds would learn rules in the current stimulus set
if they accumulated more looking times than allowed for by
the infant-controlled habituation method. Nor is it clear
from the current studies or the larger literature whether, in
general, rule learning systems might come “on line” earlier
during development than statistical learning systems, or
vice-versa. These questions await future study.

Conclusions
Perceptual primitives may be best thought of as helping to
support learning by attracting learners’ attention and
memory resources to likely structures in the environment.
Yet they do not seem to attract attention automatically, as do
some sensory primitives such as motion or high contrast,
nor are they automatically committed to memory, for either
infants or adults. Rather, evidence to date suggests that
infants at birth can discriminate certain rules and statistical
patterns when compared to unstructured input, but learning
and generalization of rules develop across the first year after
birth and beyond. On this account, perceptual primitives
such as repetition and position serve as building blocks
upon which more complex structures can be built.
