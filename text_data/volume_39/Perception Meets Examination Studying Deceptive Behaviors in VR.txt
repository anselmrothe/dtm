   Students cheating on an exam in an academic setting creates
   an environment where one person (the student) must reason
   about the perception of another (the teacher). In exploring the
   student’s mindset, trends concerning how humans make deci-
   sions based on their understanding of another human’s inten-
   tions and knowledge can be uncovered. In this work, we study
   human cheating behavior through simulated examinations in
   virtual reality, showing that the teacher’s animacy and orienta-
   tion plays a large part in the student’s reasoning of the teacher’s      (a) Cheating in a real classroom            (b) Our game
