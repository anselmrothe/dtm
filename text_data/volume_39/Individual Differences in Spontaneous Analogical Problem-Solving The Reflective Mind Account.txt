   The procedure consisted in participants signing an
informed written consent, and solving all six problems and
the CRT individually in a single 45-50 minute session. First,
the three base problems were presented one by one, with
participants having 5 minutes to solve for each problem. If
the participants failed to produce the correct solution, it was
given to them. Then the CRT was given, with 10 minutes
time to complete it. Finally, the three remaining target
problems were given one at a time.
   In order to control which of the target problems were
solved spontaneously, the participants were given 5 minutes
per problem, and if they did not produce the correct

Analysis of the analogical problems
Several types of analyses were made on the obtained data.
Firstly, the time to solve the base and target problems was
calculated. The mean time to solve all three base problems
was 198.29 sec (s4=115.44), whereas the target problems
were solved faster for an average of 161.88 sec (s=129.77).
That difference was significant (t(66)=3.76, p=.00),                  Figure 2: Time needed to correctly solve a problem from
