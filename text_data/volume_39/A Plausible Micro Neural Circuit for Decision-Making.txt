Abstract
An intermediate level between neural circuits and behaviors is
neural computations, various behaviors that animals exhibit
following some basic control laws can be implemented by some
canonical neural computations [Carandini, 2012]. To explore how
the microscopic activity of neurons leads to macroscopic
behavioral control strategy, we consider basic logic-like operations
as some canonical computations in the brain. In this paper, firstly
we designed the functional circuits for basic logic-like operations
based on the known neurophysiological properties. Secondly,
using basic functional circuits constructed a possible neural
network for decision logic of animal’s behavior. This study
provides a general approach for constructing the neural circuits to
implement the behavioral control rules. Furthermore, this study
will help us to establish a transitional bridge between the
microscopic activity of the nervous system and the macroscopic
animal behavior.

Introduction
Brain as a complex system, three distinct levels should be
understood, i.e., behavior level, algorithm level and
implementational level, which is famously known as Marr’s
tri-level hypothesis [Marr 1982]. The benefit of this clear
distinction is that researchers can focus on a certain level
and do researches purposefully. In [Carandini, 2012], the
brain was analogized to a computer, as we know, all
applications in the computer can be reduced to the most
primitive operations (Logic instructions) of CPU, so is the
brain. Researches indicate that the brain deal with different
problems by combining and repeating a core set of
canonical neural computations [Carandini & Heeger, 2011].
We understand the every detail of instructions, which were
implemented in CPU; however, we know little about the
details of circuit’s constitution in brain. However, without a
clear link to behavior and computational mechanism, it is
hard to understand what is computed. Therefore, ―We need
a foundational mechanistic, computational framework to
understand how the elements of the brain work together to
form functional units and ultimately generate the complex
cognitive behaviors‖ [Brown, 2014].

Obviously, understanding the canonical computations in
the brain is helpful to reveal the computational framework
from circuit to behavior. In this paper, we consider the basic
logical operations as some kind of canonical computations
in nervous system. Why can the logical operations be
considered a kind of canonical computations in nervous
system? We make the rational reasoning from the
computational perspective, logic reflects the most basic
requirement that any computation can be successfully
implemented. Thus, the rules through which animals control
their behavior can be described by logic language. In order
for a biological nervous system to achieve a specific
computation, its structure must be sufficiently complex to
achieve the basic logic operations. Therefore, there must be
many types of neural circuits to achieve various logical rules
in the nervous system. Since, any type of behavioral logic
can be formally described by propositional logical. With this
reliable and complete formal language, we can describe the
basic control rules accurately, with which behaviors comply.
Furthermore, with different firing mode of neurons and the
synergistic connections between pyramidal neurons and
intermediate neurons, how does the nervous system
assemble a circuit to achieve a set of specific logical rules?
The aim of our work is not to construct the neural
network to achieve the logic operations. In this paper, we
attempt to explore computational framework how the
microscopic neural activities can systematically explain the
macroscopic behavior from the logic view.

Related works
Research indicates that the brain relies on a core set of
computations to apply different functions for different
problem [Carandini & Heeger, 2011]. Neural computations,
which occur in populations of neurons, are a transitional
level from circuit to behavior. Although, some computations
have been discovered in nervous system, there are no details
of such circuits’ constitution. In order to reveal the true
mechanism of nervous system the research works involve in
different field. Table1 lists the related works.

queue is n, then the AP is delayed n milliseconds. Four
queues with sequential increases in length indicated that as
the location of the synapse on the axon moved away from
the cell body, the delays increased. If an AP was generated
in the pre-synaptic neuron, we added 1 to the head of the
queue; otherwise, we added 0. When the end of queue
element was 1, it indicated that the postsynaptic neuron
received an AP. Delays of single neuron were limited; if
large delays are required in the nervous system, Fig. 1(c)

Time delays in AP transmission
Delay means the time of AP propagating from pre-synaptic
neurons to post-synaptic neurons [Tolnai et al, 2009]. A
wide range of time delays (up to 20 ms) could occur. Since
most previous studies did not relate to specific behavioral
control logic, which was easy to ignore. In fact, the duration
from when the AP is generated to its arrival at the
postsynaptic neuron is time-critical or time-sensitive. In this
paper, the different delays of AP transmission may be
similar to ―time multiplexing‖ in signal processing, which
plays an important role in behavioral decision logic.
In this paper, we simulated the propagation delays of AP
using different queue lengths. For example, using four
different queue lengths, as shown in Fig. 1 (b, Queue 1~4),
simulated the different delays of AP propagating from the
cell body to positions 1~4 in Fig. 1(a). If the length of a

The firing rate of pyramidal neurons is adjustable
A study has indicated that intermediate neurons participate
in regulating the firing rates of neural networks [Sanders, et
al, 2013]. Fig. 2 shows a possible way of implementation
that could achieve this regulation of AFR in the nervous
system. This cooperative activity in which excitatory
neurons and inhibitory neurons regulate the AFR of
downstream neurons is a basic mechanism through which
nervous systems function.

cluster is True; if the AFR of a neuron cluster is lower
than 7 Hz, then the propositions is False.

In Fig. 2, if pyramidal neuron E received AP with a stable
AFR from upstream excitatory neurons (Eneus), then the
AFR of E could be regulated successfully by increasing or
decreasing the firing rate of upstream inhibitory neurons
(Ineus), as shown in Fig. 3. Table 2 shows changes in the
range of neuron E’s AFR with changes in the AFR of
upstream Eneus and Ineus. This basic law revealed that
nervous systems could regulate output firing rate through a
precise configuration of types of neurons and connections.

As we know that the concept of the neocortex is as an
assemblage of the basic functional units [Jean-Vincent Le
Bé, 2007]. Neurons in the fourth layer accept the external
signal input from the afferent fibers (area-b in Fig. 4). Small
pyramidal cells and intermediate neurons in the second and
third layers are responsible for processing the signal (area-a
in Fig. 4). In the fifth layer, large pyramidal cells are
responsible for propagating the ―results‖ out of the cerebral
cortex (area-c in Fig. 4). Axons are shown in black and
dendrites are shown in blue.

Neural circuit designs for logic-like operations
AP from pre-synaptic neurons can produce excitatory
post-synaptic potentials (EPSP) or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP). Since, single AP generates too
small EPSP or IPSP to activate or inhibit the postsynaptic neurons; we assume that a train of at least 40 AP
could activate the postsynaptic neuron. We employ a
group of neurons (neuron cluster) that included 50~100
neurons as a functional unit, which is used to construct
circuits to achieve the basic logic-like operations. Since,
any of the complex logic can be expressed as a logical
expression by four basic logical operations: And, Or,
Negation, and Conditional. We implement four circuits
that are equivalent to the function of these basic logic
operations. The circuits contain excitatory neurons and
inhibitory neurons.
In the paper, when a constant stimulus 7.5 adding
background noise is presented to a neuron cluster, AFR of
cluster is higher than 10Hz; while a constant stimulus 3.8
adding background noises is presented, AFR of cluster is
lower than 5Hz. If the AFR of a neuron cluster is higher
than 10 Hz, then the proposition expressed by the neuron

And-like operation is equivalent to that upstream neuron
clusters A and B both fire AP at a high rate, followed by
neuron cluster C firing at a high rate; otherwise, C fires at a
low rate. As shown in Fig. 5-Left, neurons in A and B full
connect to neurons in C. A and B represent two propositions,
and C achieves the function of operation ―A And-like B‖. As
shown in Fig.5-Right, A and B (corresponding to clusters A
and B in Fig.5-Left) that represent the incoming information
should be distributed in the fourth layer of the neocortex. C
(corresponding to C in Fig.5-Left) that achieves the
computation of the And-like operation for A and B should
be distributed in the second and third layer. At last, the
processing results are propagated out of neocortex by the
large pyramidal cells in the fifth layers. We re-layout the
Fig.5-Left and obtain the Fig.5-Right. The new circuit
satisfies the anatomical discoveries and achieves the logic
function. It is a feasible implementation in neurobiology.

circuit
Conditional-like operation is equivalent to a simple
projection relationship from upstream to downstream
neurons, such that if upstream neurons fires with a high rate,
then downstream neurons fires with a high rate; otherwise,
downstream neurons fire at a low rate. Negation-like
operation is equivalent that if A fires AP at a high rate, then
C fires with a low rate; otherwise, C fires with a high rate.
As shown in Fig.8-left, neurons in A fully connect to
neurons in I1… Im, E1… Ek, and neurons in I1… Im, E1… Ek,
full connect to neurons in C. In addition, for local circuits:
E1 Conditional-like C, and Ek Conditional-like C. Neurons in
I1… Im are all inhibitory, and the others are excitatory. A
represents a proposition, and C performs the function of
operation ―Negation-like A‖. Its possible form in neocortex
is shown in Fig. 8-right.

moment. The distribution property of AP from neurons in
cluster B is similar to that of A. If neuron clusters A and B
both fire at a high rate, AP trains from A and B at least
partially overlap. The purpose of this design is that when
only one of the two neuron clusters fires at a high rate, the
strength of the subsequent EPSP is too weak to activate C
fire at a high rate. However, when A and B both fire at a
high rate, due to the overlap of EPSP, the strength of the
EPSP is sufficiently strong that C fires at a high rate as well.
However, we found that C would not fire with a high rate
every time during the experiment. The EPSP from A and B
does not necessarily overlap because the overlap is timecritical or time-sensitive. Thus, it is possible that C fires at a
low rate even if both A and B fire at high rate. To avoid
such a situation, one feasible way that we used neuron
clusters as functional units, and the properties of neurons in
a cluster are different, including the model parameters and
AP delays. Therefore, initiation of neuronal firing is
asynchronous. As a result, EPSP always can be overlapped
in C. When A and B both fire at high rate, and C fires with a
high rate. Typical values for the delays of neuronal AP are 1
ms, 2 ms, …20 ms in A and B; each delay has the same
number of neurons, and the model parameters of each
neuron is little different. As shown in Fig. 6, only when
neuron clusters A and B both fire at a high rate, does C fire
at a high rate [Fig. 6(d)]; otherwise, C fires at a low rate [Fig.
6(a), (b), and (c)]. This circuit performs the function of Andlike operation.

Or-like operation is equivalent that if at least one of

The structure in Fig5 can also achieve the function of Orlike operation through modifying the parameters to make
sure that APs from neuron clusters A and B are synchronous
and concentrated, and when one of the two clusters fires at a
high rate, at least 40 AP have reached C at one given
moment. Typical values for the delays of the neuronal AP

that when at least one of the two neuron clusters (A, B) fires

nearly continuous IPSP. Thus, neurons in C are inhibited,
and C could not fire at a high rate. When A fires at a low
rate, the intermediate neurons fire less than 60 Hz, which
could not inhibit the activity of downstream neurons. Here,

Turn_R, the rat made a decision with turning right. The
decision logic could be described such that the rat was
thirsty, and working memory retained the left (or right) side
of the Y-maze from which the rat last drank. Then, when the
rat reached the neck of the Y-maze again, it executed the
command of turning right (or turning left). The process of
decision logic could be expressed by a proposition logical
expression: (Thirsty ˄ Drink_L ˄ At_Neck → Turn_R) ˅ (Thirsty

could achieve this decision logic, as shown in Fig. 11.

were 1 ms, 10 ms, and 20 ms, and AP delays from A to
neuron clusters E1, E2, and E3 are 20 ms, 40 ms, and 60 ms,
respectively. AP delays from I1, I2, and I3 to neuron cluster
C are 1 ms, and AP delays from E1, E2, and E3 to C are 30

above settings are not absolute. The circuit performs the
transfer of a low firing rate to a high firing rate [Fig. 9(a)],
and a high firing rate to a low firing rate [Fig. 9(b)].

Any of the propositional logical expressions can be
transferred into an equivalent conjunctive or disjunctive
paradigm. Thus, the nervous system could possibly perform
a logic function by realizing the corresponding paradigm.
We demonstrated the implementation of a neural circuit
for decision-making logic using a rat’s behavioral decision.
In the behavioral experiment [Yang et al., 2014], the rat was
trained to go to alternate arms of a Y-maze for drinking, and
after the training, the rat never made a mistake to the same
side two times as shown in Fig. 10. This experiment verified
that the rat formed a set of accurate rules for decision
making (turning left or right), which depended on the
information that the side from which the rat obtained the last
drink, and whether the rat reached the neck of the Y-maze.

We outlined the behavior in a set of logical expressions:
Drink_L, the rat last drank on the left side of the Y-maze;
Drink_R, the rat last drank on the right side; Thirsty, the rat

Taking the rat executing the turning-right command as an
example, the details of the circuit were such that: First, four
neuron clusters represented the four propositions, Thirsty,
Drink_L, At_Neck, and Turn_R. If the AFR of a neuron cluster
was higher than 10 Hz, then the corresponding proposition
was true; otherwise it was false. Second, we constructed the
neural circuit for the logical expression: Thirsty ˄ Drink_L
based on the And-like circuit. Third, we constructed the
neural circuit for the logical expression: Thirsty ˄ Drink_L ˄
At_Neck based on the And-like circuit. Finally, we
constructed the circuit (Thirsty ˄ Drink_L ˄ At_Neck)→Turn_R
based on the Conditional-like circuit. In addition, we
designed two groups of intermediate neurons (I3 and I4)
between Turn_R and Turn_L to avoid misuse; Drink_L and
Drink_R were also mutually exclusive, if the two
propositions were both true, the decision making would be
disordered. When the rat was in a given status, the neuron
cluster that expressed the opposite status was inhibited. The
complete circuit for decision-making is shown in Fig. 11.
We simulated the process of decision-making for a rat in
a Y-maze. As shown in Fig. 12, (L-Choice) If the rat last
drank at the right side of the Y-maze (Drink_R=True), then
when the rat reached the neck of the Y-maze (At_Neck= True)
it executed the command turning-left (Turn_L=True);
otherwise, the rat executed the command turning-right
(Turn_L=False). (R-Choice) If the rat last drank at the left
side of the Y-maze, then when the rat reached the neck of
Y-maze, rat executed the command turning-left; otherwise,
the rat executed the command turning-right.

Conclusion
Finally, we summarize our work through Marr’s threelevel hierarchy. (a) What is computed? Our answer is that
some logical rules are computed. Modeling from this
perspective can help us to understand the functional base
line of it. (b) Why is it computed? For sake of accurate
behavior-controlling, these logical rules must be
computed, which is the fundamental demand to a specific
behavior. (c) How is it computed? In this paper, we
design some types of local neural circuits to achieve four
basic logic-like operations as canonical computations and
assemble them to simulate a rat’s decision making
behaviors in Y-maze. Firstly, our circuit design is highly
faithful to neurobiological facts like neuron firing mode,
two major types of neuron, the proportion constrain of
their numbers, and pulse-based mode of communication.
Secondly, in the scope of cortical column our logicalequivalent local circuits are biologically plausible to be
implemented. Thirdly, these basic functional modular are
configurable, reusable and combinable.
We lack a bridge theory from circuit to behavior
[Carandini, 2012]. For example, how do microscopic
activities of neurons and logical relationships in circuits
support the achievement of cognitive ability? Our aim is to
construct a biological neural network for behavioral control
rules from a logic perspective. This study may be useful for
gradually transitioning from microscopic neural activity to
macroscopic behavioral control. In our future works, we
will explore neural computational mechanism about how
a proper circuit is formed.
