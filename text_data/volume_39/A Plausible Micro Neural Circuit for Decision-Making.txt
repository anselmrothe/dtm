* Violating basic biological facts includes:(1) the activation mode of the MP model is two-valued, but that of biological neuron is impulse-firing; (2)the
type of ANN’s neuron is unitary, however, in the biological neural system, not only multiple types of neurons exist but also their proportion matters; (3)the
numerical settings of threshold and connection weights of ANN being able to adjust at will are too idealistic; (4)numerical neurons in the same layer working
with perfect synchronization are too idealistic, however, time differences of signal transmitting are more general.
