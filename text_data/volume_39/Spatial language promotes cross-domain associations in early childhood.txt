Test Trials
Perceptual Matching Task In the perceptual matching
task, participants matched pictures of aliens to the types of
sounds they make. Critically, in these trials verbal labels
were never used to describe the stimuli. There were two trial
types: space as source (the referent is a spatial dimension
and participants chose the sound that matched in pitch or
duration) or space as target (the referent is a sound that
varies in pitch or duration and participants chose the alien
with a matching spatial attribute). For the space as source
trials, a single alien was presented in front of two trees and
the experimenter said that the alien was looking for another
alien just like it. The experimenter said that the alien could
be hiding behind either tree, and pointed to each tree as the
sound of the alien hiding behind it was played. The                  Figure 1: Children's cross-domain matching performance by
