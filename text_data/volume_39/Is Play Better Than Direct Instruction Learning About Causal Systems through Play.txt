some blocks made them go. The twelve activator blocks
shown in the demonstration phase were placed in front of the
child as well. The experimenter then told the child, “I just
remembered I have to do some work now, but while I work,
you can play with these machines and these blocks.” The
children were given approximately ten minutes to play with
the machines and blocks. If the child did not make any
attempt to activate the machines for one minute, the
experimenter prompted the child by saying, “Why don’t you
try to make the machines go?” After ten minutes, the blocks
