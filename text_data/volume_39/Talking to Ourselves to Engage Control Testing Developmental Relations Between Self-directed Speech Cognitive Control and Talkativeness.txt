then age-related changes in speech should be found across
tasks, and self-directed speech should be associated with
cognitive performance. However, if self-directed speech
does not generally change across childhood and manifests
differently depending on task demands and child
characteristics, then inter-task correlations among self-
directed speech indices may be present, and possibly
correlated with talkativeness, but relations with age should
be less consistent.
