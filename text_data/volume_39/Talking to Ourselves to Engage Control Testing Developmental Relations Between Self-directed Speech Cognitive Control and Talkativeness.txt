Abstract
Is self-directed speech critical to cognitive processes
supporting complex, goal-directed behavior? If so, how? An
influential developmental hypothesis is that children talk to
themselves to support cognitive control processes, and that
with age this speech becomes increasingly covert and
strategic. However, while many studies suggest language
supports cognitive control, evidence that self-directed speech
gradually internalizes has been mixed. Moreover, extraneous
factors that could co-vary with self-directed speech, age, and
cognitive control, such as talkativeness, have not been
systematically tested. In this cross-sectional study of 86 5- to
7-year-old children we measured overt, partially covert, inner,
and strategic speech on four cognitive tasks, along with task
performance and child talkativeness. We did not find
consistent evidence that self-directed speech changes with
age; however, we did find consistent associations between
self-directed speech and talkativeness. Partially covert and
strategic speech predicted performance on one task, and inner
speech was implicated on another. Self-directed speech
tended to correlate across tasks, and these correlations held
controlling for talkativeness. Taken together, these findings
suggest 5- to 7-year-old children may use different forms of
self-directed speech to support cognitive control, and that the
form this speech takes depends in part on factors beyond age,
such as the cognitive demands of a task and child
characteristics like talkativeness.

Introduction
What role does language play in our ability to flexibly
override impulses and achieve goals? An influential
developmental hypothesis is that language is key to the
emergence and exercise of cognitive processes supporting
goal-directed behavior (Luria, 1961; Vygotsky 1934/2012;
Winsler, Fernyhough, & Montero, 2009). On this view,
children’s control processes are initially supported by the
speech of others (e.g., parents and teachers), and later by
children’s own external speech, which is gradually
internalized as inner speech (i.e., verbal thought) during
childhood. Self-directed speech is thought to change
qualitatively with internalization (e.g., becoming more
condensed), allowing it to more effectively support
cognitive control (Alderson-Day & Fernyhough, 2015;
Vygotsky 1934/2012).
This hypothesis fits with a large body of research
indicating that language supports cognitive control across
development. Children use their own speech to support
many aspects of cognitive control, including planning (Al-

Namlah, Fernyhough, & Meins, 2006; Fernyhough &
Fradley, 2005;), working memory (Al-Namlah et al., 2006;
Flavell, Beach, & Chinsky, 1966), and task switching
(Karbach & Kray, 2007). Moreover, linguistic interventions
in which labels or other kinds of linguistic input are
provided to children have been found to support cognitive
control performance both in the moment (e.g., Kray, Eber,
& Karbach, 2008) and in the longer-term (Doebel,
Dickerson, Hoover, & Munakata, 2017; Doebel & Zelazo,
2016). Experiments using articulatory suppression during
cognitive tasks suggest older children and adults use inner
speech when engaging cognitive control (e.g., Emerson &
Miyake, 2003; Kray, et al., 2008).
Key questions remain concerning the extent to which selfdirected speech changes with age, and the kinds of speech
children use to support cognitive control. Evidence for the
hypothesis that self-directed speech gradually internalizes
has been mixed. For example, while some studies have
found that overt, task-relevant speech decreases with age
(Winsler & Naglieri, 2003), others have not (Al-Namlah, et
al., 2006; Flavell et al., 1966). And external forms of selfdirected speech do not always predict performance (e.g.,
Doebel, et al., 2017; Winsler & Naglieri, 2003). Moreover,
key variables that might account for the presence or absence
of different forms of self-directed speech have not been
systematically examined. For example, how talkative a child
is may co-vary with age, performance, and self-directed
speech, and thus could explain any relations found among
these variables. Consistent with this idea, previous work has
found correlations between self-directed speech and social
speech/talkativeness (Al-Namlah et al., 2006; Fernyhough
& Fradley, 2005).
Gaining further insight into factors that predict selfdirected speech in childhood is critical both to
understanding the role of language in cognitive control and
how it can be improved in those who struggle with it. For
example, if self-directed speech does generally internalize
with age across a particular age window, this could suggest
that training children to internalize their speech might help
them better engage control.
The current study aimed to clarify relations between selfdirected speech, age, performance, and talkativeness in
children 5 to 7 years of age, a developmental period posited
to reflect key transitions in self-directed speech
(Gathercole, 1998; Winsler & Naglieri, 2003; Winsler et al.,
2009). We assessed children’s use of task-relevant overt,
partially covert, inner, and strategic speech during four

1937

cognitive tasks tapping control processes. The study
evaluated two contrasting hypotheses. If self-directed
speech becomes more internalized and strategic with age,
then age-related changes in speech should be found across
tasks, and self-directed speech should be associated with
cognitive performance. However, if self-directed speech
does not generally change across childhood and manifests
differently depending on task demands and child
characteristics, then inter-task correlations among selfdirected speech indices may be present, and possibly
correlated with talkativeness, but relations with age should
be less consistent.

Following three practice trials, children completed 12 test
trials.

Method
Participants
Eight-six 5- to 7-year-old children (Mage = 5.99 years SDage
= .61, range = 5.0 – 7.1; females = 47) were recruited from a
database of families who had previously indicated interest in
participating in research. Four additional children were
excluded from the study due to uncooperativeness (n = 3)
and developmental delay (n = 1). Some children did not
complete all tasks due to failure to demonstrate
understanding during practice or uncooperativeness. In total,
84, 83, 72, and 76 children completed the delayed serial
recall task, selective attention task, Tower of London, and
the immediate serial recall task, respectively. Most
participants (> 90%) had at least one parent with a four-year
college degree and were Caucasian and non-Hispanic.

Measures
Children completed four cognitive measures across two test
sessions. The tasks were completed in the following order:
delayed serial recall, selective attention, Tower of London,
and immediate serial recall. A fixed order was used to
minimize variation between subjects in task performance
due to differences in order (Friedman, et al., 2008). The first
three measures were used to assess external self-directed
speech in addition to cognitive performance. The last
measure was used to index inner speech.
Delayed Serial Recall Task (adapted from Flavell,
Beach, & Chinsky, 1966; Fig. 1) Children were presented
with pictures of objects serially on a computer screen, and,
after an eight second delay, were asked to recall the order in
which they were presented. At test, the three items were
presented together in a new order, and children had to point
to the pictures in the order that they saw them. Following
three practice trials, children completed 10 test trials.
Selective Attention Task (adapted from Manfra &
Winsler, 2006; Fig. 2) Children were shown a page of three
pictures that matched on one of three dimensions (shape,
color, number), and were asked to search a box for a picture
card that reflected the matching dimension. The box
contained 18 picture cards depicting a single dimensional
value (e.g., a purple splotch or a silhouette of a star).

Figure 1: Delayed serial recall task.
Tower of London planning task (adapted from
Fernyhough & Fradley, 2005; Fig. 3) Children were
presented with two apparatuses, each of which had three
wooden pegs of different lengths and three colored wooden
spheres on the pegs. The spheres were configured in a
different arrangement on each apparatus, and children were
instructed to make one apparatus look like the other in as
few moves as possible. They were also instructed that they
could only move one sphere at a time and had to keep all
spheres on the pegs (i.e., not holding a sphere in their hand
while making moves with another sphere). Children
completed six trials in total, half of which could be
completed in three moves, and the other half of which could
be completed in four moves. Performance was indexed by
the total number of moves children made in excess of the
minimum number required, divided by the total number of
trials completed. If children broke rules or asked to start
over, the trial was restarted. Only the final attempt at a trial
and trials that were successfully completed were included in
our analyses.
Immediate Serial Recall (adapted from Al-Namlah et al.,
2006; Tam, Jarrold, Baddeley, & Sabatos-DeVito, 2010)
This task was identical to the delayed serial recall task
except that 1) there was no delay between the stimuli
presentation and the test phase; 2) children were instructed
not to label the pictures overtly while they were being
initially presented (Al-Namlah et al., 2006); and 3) children
completed two ten-trial blocks instead of one: a
phonologically similar block and a phonologically
dissimilar block. The phonologically dissimilar block
involved the same items presented in the delayed serial
recall task. The phonologically similar block involved items
that had similar-sounding names (e.g., clock, clown, cat).
Inner speech was indexed as the accuracy rate on the
phonologically similar block subtracted from the accuracy
rate on the phonologically dissimilar block, with the

1938

expectation that children who used inner speech (i.e., verbal
coding of the to-be-remembered objects) would perform
worse on the phonologically similar block because verbal
coding would make the items more confusable.

(during the presentation and test interval) were coded. On
the selective attention task, labeling the matching dimension
(e.g., “They’re all purple”) at the onset of or during the test
trial was coded. On the Tower of London task, labeling the
sphere and the location the child was placing or planning to
place it was coded (e.g., “This one goes here for now”). For
analyses, the number of trials on which a child used each
coded form of speech was scaled by the number of trials the
child completed.

Talkativeness Parents were asked to rate their child’s level
of talkativeness with people he or she does not know on a 5point scale, with 1 indicating that the child is not at all
talkative, and 5 indicating that the child is very talkative.
This approach was adapted from prior work in which
teachers were asked to rate children’s general talkativeness
(Fernyhough & Fradley, 2005). We opted to ask more
specifically about talkativeness with unfamiliar people in
order to reduce the likelihood that parents’ evaluations
would reflect how talkative their child is at home, which we
expected would result in a less sensitive measure.

As expected, all cognitive tasks elicited some self-directed
speech (Table 1), and there was variability across tasks in
the kinds of speech children used. However, numerous
children did not use overt or partially covert self-directed
speech on the tasks: 20 of 84 on the delayed serial recall
task; 21 of 84 on the selective attention task; and 29 of 77
on the Tower of London task. This is comparable to rates of
self-directed speech found in prior work (Fernyhough &
Fradley, 2005; Flavell et al., 1966; Manfra & Winsler, 2006;
Winsler & Naglieri, 2003). Children showed evidence of
inner speech on the immediate recall task, performing
significantly worse on the phonologically similar block
(Maccuracy = 65%, SD = 22%) than on the phonologically
dissimilar block (Maccuracy = 72%, SD = 24%), Mdiff = .07
SDdiff = .17, t(76) = 3.74, p < .001, consistent with previous
findings (Al-Namlah et al., 2006; Tam, et al., 2010).

Self-directed Speech Coding
Our coding scheme was based on prior work in this area
(Winsler & Naglieri, 2003; Flavell et al., 1966). Speech
during each trial of each cognitive task was coded from
videos by a research assistant who was blind to the
experimental hypotheses. Ten percent of the videos were
coded by a second blinded research assistant and inter-rater
agreement was high, rs > .85. Each task was coded for nonsocial overt speech, defined as normal volume speech not
directed at another person that could support task
performance (rather than meta-comments about the task or
stimuli, or comments unrelated to the task) and partially
covert speech, such as whispering, muttering, and lip
movement.
In addition, task-specific speech strategies were coded.

Relations Between Self-directed Speech and Age
We found minimal support for the hypothesis that selfdirected speech changes with age (Table 2). Zero-order
correlations indicated that only partially covert speech on
the selective attention task was related to age, such that as
children got older they used less partially covert speech

Relations Between Self-directed Speech and
Performance
Children performed well on the four tasks (Table 3) and
examination of histograms did not reveal floor or ceiling
effects. Self-directed speech predicted performance on the
delayed serial recall task. Zero-order correlations indicate
partially covert speech and rehearsal were associated with
performance on the delayed serial recall task, and also
indicated a marginally significant association between
labeling and performance on that task (Table 2). These
findings were confirmed with linear models. Partially covert
speech was a significant predictor of performance on
delayed serial recall, controlling for overt speech, B = .22,
SE = .07, t = 3.2, p = .002, whereas overt speech was not
predictive when controlling for partially covert speech, t <1,
p > .25. Similarly, rehearsal was a significant predictor of
performance on the delayed serial recall task, controlling for
labeling, B = .18, SE = .07, t = 2.62, p = .02, consistent with
prior work (Flavell et al., 1966). There was also a nonsignificant trend such that labeling tended to predict
performance on the delayed serial recall task, controlling for
rehearsal, B = .09, t = 1.59, p = .11. However, self-directed
speech on the selective attention task and Tower of London
was not predictive of performance on those tasks, ts < 1, ps
> .25.

(Table 2). All other age/self-directed speech correlations
were not significant.
These analyses were followed up with linear regressions
predicting age from self-directed speech, with related
speech indices simultaneously included in models to control
for one another’s effects, and the results were unchanged.
On the selective attention task, partially covert speech
remained a significant predictor, B = -7.36, SE = 2.82, t =
2.60, p = .01, whereas overt speech was not, t < 1, p > .25.
On the delayed serial recall task and Tower of London,
neither overt nor partially covert speech were associated
with age, ts < 1.38, ps >.17. Similarly, neither rehearsal nor
labeling changed with age on the delayed serial recall task,
ts > 1.5, ps >.13.

Across tasks, children who tended to use external forms of
self-directed speech also tended to be more talkative (Table
2). Talkativeness was correlated with overt speech on all
tasks, partially covert speech on the Tower of London (but
not the delayed serial recall or selective attention tasks), and
labeling (but not rehearsal) on the delayed serial recall and
selective attention tasks. Inner speech on the immediate
recall task was not associated with talkativeness.
Talkativeness was not associated with age, r = -.06, p > .25,
nor was it associated with performance on any of the tasks,
rs < .16, ps > .14. As such, it was not included as a control
variable in any models involving these factors.

Correlations Between Self-directed Speech Indices
Within and Across Tasks
Many self-directed speech indices were correlated across
tasks (Table 3). For example, children who used partially
covert speech on the delayed serial recall task also tended to
use it on the selective attention and Tower of London tasks,
and children who used rehearsal on the delayed serial recall
task tended to label on the selective attention task. These
findings generally held when controlling for talkativeness,
with the exception that some of the correlations between
partially covert speech on Tower of London and other
indices (partially covert speech and labeling on delayed
serial recall, and labeling on selective attention) were no
longer statistically significant, rs < .18, ps >.10.
We also found many correlations between self-directed
speech indices within tasks. Some correlations were very
strong, suggesting that certain strategies tend to be
expressed more or less covertly.

Discussion
The current study provides several new findings related to
the role of self-directed speech in developing cognitive
control. We did not find evidence that self-directed speech
undergoes a general internalization process with age.
Instead, our findings suggest that the format of self-directed
speech may depend in part on other factors like child
talkativeness and the specific cognitive demands of a task.
We found that 5- to 7-year-old children used inner, partially
covert, and strategic speech while engaging cognitive
control on different tasks, and that more overt forms of
speech tended to be related to talkativeness. The finding that
external forms of self-directed speech predicted
performance on the delayed serial recall task but not the
selective attention and Tower of London tasks suggests that
children may have been supporting cognitive performance
on the latter tasks with internalized speech. The delayed
serial recall task likely had the highest working memory
demands of all the tasks (given the need to maintain three
items in mind in a particular order across time) and as such,
external speech may have been necessary to support
performance. Conversely, the working memory demands of
the selective attention and Tower of London tasks may have
been lower, and thus inner speech may have been sufficient
to support performance on those tasks. For example, on the
selective attention task children needed to identify a
common dimension among three objects on a page and keep
that dimension in mind to guide their searching, but they
could always look back at the objects on the page to recall
the dimension, and they only had to maintain one dimension
in mind.
These findings are consistent with an alternative view of
how linguistic input influences developing cognitive
control, and highlight the possibility that inner speech may
play a role in cognitive control from early in development.
For example, teaching 5-year-old children labels that can be
used to support cognitive control helps children later engage
control; however, children’s tendency to vocalize the labels

when engaging control does not predict performance
(Doebel, et al., 2017), consistent with the possibility that
children can rapidly internalize speech used to support
control. Foundational cognitive control processes begin to
develop very early in life (Munakata, 1998), and continue to
develop rapidly in early childhood, between 3 and 5 years of
age (Diamond, 2013). Internalized forms of self-directed
speech could be critical to the emergence of these processes.
An alternative interpretation of our findings is that there
are indeed robust age-related changes in self-directed
speech, but that our age range and sample size were too
constrained to detect them. For example, prior work has
found age differences in the use of rehearsal to support
serial recall when the age groups being compared were 5, 7
and 10 years (Flavell et al., 1966), and that overt selfdirected speech decreases with age in a large sample aged 5
to 17 years (Winsler & Naglieri, 2003). However, given the
frequency and variability in speech use in the current study,
and that our sample spanned an age range identified as a
transition period in the use of self-directed speech (e.g.,
Winsler & Naglieri, 2003; Winsler, et al., 2009), it was
surprising that age was not a significant predictor of speech
on most tasks. Another possibility is that age-related
patterns only manifest when cognitive demands are high and
inner speech is insufficient to maintain the goal
representations guiding performance. Future experiments
can test this by manipulating the maintenance demands in a
task and testing associations between age and self-directed
speech.
Our findings are correlational, leaving open alternative
explanations for the relation between self-directed speech
and cognitive control. For example, it is possible that
developmental increases in cognitive control lead to changes
in self-directed speech (and that self-directed speech is
epiphenomenal). Or a third, unmeasured variable may
explain the relation between self-directed speech and
cognitive control. Experiments manipulating cognitive
control and testing influences on self-directed speech, and
vice versa, could address this causal issue.

1941

Self-directed speech may be a good target for
interventions to improve cognitive control. Given that
cognitive control develops dramatically in early childhood
and predicts success in life across a range of outcomes (e.g.,
academics, health, and wealth; Moffitt, et al., 2011), there
has been great interest in developing effective interventions
to improve it. However, results of interventions to date have
been mixed (e.g., Melby-Lervag & Hulme, 2013). One
potential reason is that approaches to date have not
optimally targeted the processes that support developing
cognitive control. Training children to use different forms of
self-directed speech to support cognitive performance, such
as labeling, rehearsal, and partially covert speech, may be a
fruitful approach to improving control in children.1
The current study advances knowledge on the role of selfdirected speech in cognitive control by suggesting that the
kinds of speech children use to support cognitive
performance in childhood may depend on a range of factors
beyond age, such as child talkativeness and the cognitive
demands of a task. Future work can further test how selfdirected speech relates to cognitive control and how it can
be targeted in cognitive control interventions.

Children have been successfully trained to use rehearsal to
support delayed serial recall, but they stopped using the strategy
when told they did not have to use it (Keeney, Canizzo, & Flavell,
1967). Whether children stopped because they could not sustain
the strategy or because the experimenter’s instructions influenced
motivation to use it is not clear.
