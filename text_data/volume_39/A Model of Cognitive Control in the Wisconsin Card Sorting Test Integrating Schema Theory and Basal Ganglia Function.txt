Loss Error (SL) is counted whenever an incorrect response
is selected after 5 or more correct responses, where at least
one is unambiguous (i.e., the card matches only one
feature). A Perseverative response (PR) is counted
whenever a response would have been correct under the
previous rule. (A subject can score a perseverative response
even before completing the first category: if three
consecutive responses are made selecting the same sorting
rule, that rule will be the criterion that the subject can
perseverate to.) Those perseverative responses that are also
