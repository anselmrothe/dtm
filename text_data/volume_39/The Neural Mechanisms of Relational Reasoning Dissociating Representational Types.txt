Abstract
The ability to reason about information is an essential human
capability. It is less understood from the perspective of neurocognitive processes which can serve to constrain cognitive
theories by implications from neuroscientific data. Despite
some progress in the last decades, some disagreement about
the experimental results and the cognitive processes of
reasoning with abstract relations versus visuospatial relations
persist. We conducted a cross-study meta-analysis of
neuroimaging studies to determine the neural correlates of
visuospatial and abstract relational reasoning. We analyzed
884 stereotactic data points from 38 studies and 692 subjects.
We found that relational reasoning is mediated by the frontoparietal network, especially the right precuneus and the left
pars triangularis. Problems with abstract relations are
processed by enhanced activation in the inferior parietal lobe,
whereas visuospatial reasoning is promoted by prefrontal
domains. Our results disentangle the neurocognitive
mechanisms of different representational types of relational
reasoning across study designs.

Introduction
Relational reasoning expedites human everyday life to a
great extent. Using relational expressions can decrease the
number of statements we would need otherwise to describe
the situation. If we want to ‘decompress’ this information,
we draw inferences from the given information to extract
what is implicitly present. For example, suppose you are
visiting London for the first time and you want to visit
London Eye. You take the underground, arrive at Waterloo
Station and ask a fellow passenger for the directions. She
tells you that the London Eye is behind Jubilee Gardens
which are, from your perspective, in front of Waterloo
Station. Due to this description, you can easily find your
goal destination. But how would you find your way from
the station to London Eye without having any explicit
information about the spatial orientation? You do need to
reason, that means, you need to extract the information from
the two statements by inferring that the London Eye is
located behind the train station.
Reasoning has been subject to neurocognitive research for
the past thirty years. With the advent of neuroimaging
methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and

functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the late
1990s and early 2000s, seminal work has been
accomplished by investigating the neural correlates of
reasoning (Prado, Chadha & Booth, 2011). The potential for
research in relational reasoning is manifold. For instance,
Knauff and Johnson-Laird (2002) proposed to differentiate
deductive relational reasoning tasks based on the kind of
mental representation necessary to represent relations. They
established the categories of visual, spatial and visuospatial
mental representation of the relations which differs from
the mental representation of objects they relate. For our
study, we decided to reevaluate the differentiations and
employed new definitions for the types of mental
representation. A relation helps to structure human
experiences about one or many objects in everyday life and
they can be of different types. A spatial relation reflects
implicitly or explicitly an order of objects (e.g., the apple is
to the left of the pear). Such a relation can be perceived by
the visual system and additionally by other sensory systems
that allow to perceive order such as ‘touch’ for instance. A
pure visual relation in turn is only perceivable by the visual
system and by no other perception system (e.g., the grass is
greener than the tree). Visuospatial relations are perceivable
by both, the visual and other systems, such as ‘laying on top
of something’ – this is an ordered relation and at the same
time the relation ‘top’ presupposes a surface perceived
visually. Abstract relations are inconceivable by any sensory
systems, such as mental attributions (e.g., smarter than) or
abstract mathematical operations (e.g., ‘=’).
To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no study
investigating such aspects of relational reasoning that
directly relate to different degrees of imaginability of
relations. To collect a sufficient number of data by often
diverse study designs, we decided to use a broader, more
inclusive relaxation on the data aggregation. Such a
relaxation on the rather strict definitions is necessary since
methods such as activation likelihood estimation (ALE) are
more accurate for larger datasets (Eickhoff et al., 2016).
On the basis of this experimental background, we decided
to investigate relational reasoning in general as well as two
of its variants, visuospatial and abstract relational reasoning.
Our hypotheses are: (1) For the abstract condition, we
expect enhanced activation in the posterior parietal cortex
(PPC) (Hobeika, Diard-Detoeuf, Garcin, Levy & Volle,

3510

2016; Maier, Ragni, Wenczel & Franzmeier, 2014;
Wendelken 2015) and the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex
(RLPFC) which are regions known to be involved in the
processing of abstract information (Christoff, Ream, Geddes
& Gabrieli, 2003). (2) We expect activation in the right
superior parietal lobule (SPL) for the visuospatial condition.
This is because it is hypothesized that visuospatial mental
representations in reasoning are constructed and maintained
by the help of these regions (Maier et al., 2014; Ragni,
Franzmeier, Maier & Knauff, 2016).
To study the neural correlates of relational reasoning we
considered 38 experiments with a total of 692 participants
and 884 foci to find the neural sites which are most likely to
be active during relational reasoning in general and in
visuospatial and abstract relational reasoning. The results
are interpreted in the light of prior neurocognitive research.

Methods
We apply the ALE method (Eickhoff, Bzdok, Laird, Kurth
& Fox, 2012) which has become a standard to conduct
meta-analyses to investigate neural correlates (e.g., Hobeika
et al., 2016). We include as neuroimaging methods
functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron
emission tomography (PET) data.

Paper Acquisition and Selection
For acquiring neuroimaging data, we conducted several
online search queries via the online platforms PubMed,
ScienceDirect and Google Scholar to find peer-reviewed
fMRI and PET studies (see Table 1) between 1998 and
2017. We used the search terms ‘fMRI OR PET OR
Neuroimaging’, ‘relational OR transitive reasoning’ and
‘visual reasoning OR spatial reasoning OR visuospatial
reasoning’ in all queries and additionally for the query in
Science direct ‘healthy’, and for Google Scholar ‘MNI OR
Talairach’. Additional articles were found via the reference
lists of similar papers, the meta-analysis conducted by
Prado, Chadha and Booth (2011) and the reviews by Knauff
(2006) and Maier et al. (2014). Due to a review of the metaanalysis conducted by Prado, Chadha and Booth (2011),
‘reasoning vs. baseline’ conditions (such as fixation cross or
maintenance tasks, see e.g., Wendelken, Nakhabenko,
Donohue, Carter & Bunge, 2008 and Ruff, Knauff,
Fangmeier & Spreer, 2003, respectively) as well as ‘highvs. low-level reasoning’ conditions were included since they

3511

represent an aspect of reasoning. Additionally, experimental
data were only included when they were reported in MNI or
Talairach space and yielded from whole brain analyses.

Paper Categorization
We decided to categorize the data along different axes: by
the type of mental representation of the relation (abstract,
spatial, visual, visuospatial, none), by the stimulus (letters,
sentences, shapes, words, numbers) and the type of stimulus
presentation (visual or auditory) (see Tables 1 and 2). We
acknowledge that these differences may reflect differences
in neural activation as well but chose to only consider the
types of mental representation and subtraction for the sake
of including more studies in each group and yielding more
robust results.
When reviewing the articles, we realized that our
definitions for the mental representations of relations did not
fit to what can be found in actual studies. Because of that,
we decided to lower our criteria so that we merged the
groups ‘visual’, ‘spatial’ and ‘visuospatial’ to the group
‘visuospatial’ (see Table 2). Also, we redefined the criteria
so that visuospatial relations are relations that are easy to
mentally envision in a spatial and/or visual manner in the
aforementioned sense. For abstract tasks, we included all
tasks that are impossible to potentially perceive by senses,
such as mathematical tasks and operators (e.g., ‘=’, ‘<’, ‘>’).

ALE is an established method for conducting meta-analyses
of neuroimaging data (Eickhoff et al., 2012). It is
implemented in the statistical tool GingerALE1 (we used
version 2.3.6) to determine the likelihood of individual brain
regions activating for a specific task. GingerALE features
the conduction of either single dataset analyses or
conjunction and contrast analyses between datasets.
The ALE algorithm maps the stereotactic data of each
experiment on a template brain to generate Modeled
Activation (MA) maps. Since the reported data are as
points, it reconstructs the scanning data by assigning each
data point the center of a Gaussian distribution. The points
are blurred by the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
which is determined by the subject size of the respective
dataset (Eickhoff et al., 2012). The MA maps are merged to
render the final ALE file. For each voxel, the likelihood
confidence of finding each value is calculated by neglecting
spatial information from the dataset and analyzing the
probabilities of values being part of an MA map. The
information from the two files is combined and a threshold
is applied to constitute the final ALE map (Eickhoff et al.,
2012). In our analysis, we chose a standard setting of 1000
permutations, the cluster-level family-wise error (FWE)
method with a p-value of 0.01 and an uncorrected p of 0.001
(Eickhoff et al., 2016). The cluster-level FWE method
generates a random dataset tantamount to the set at hand
(regarding subject size, number of foci and number of

originally represented in MNI (Montreal Neurological
Institute) space were converted to Talairach space. In
conjunction and contrast analyses, the ALE maps of two
sets are examined in activation likelihood for their overlap
and distinctness respectively.

For the relational reasoning condition, activation was most
likely found in the right precuneus (BA 7) and the left
middle occipital gyrus (BA 31). Concerning the frontal lobe,
the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), left
posterior-medial frontal, left and right middle frontal gyrus
(BA 6) and the left middle orbital gyrus (BA 46) were
found. Additionally, activation was found in the right basal
ganglia (Tables 3 and 4).

Discussion

Activation in reasoning about abstract relations was found
in the right angular gyrus and left superior parietal lobule
(hIP 1/3 respectively, both BA 7) and the left and right
inferior frontal gyrus (triangularis, BA 45) and precentral
gyrus (BA 45).

Relational Reasoning involves the fronto-parietal
network and occipital lobe
For reasoning about relations, we found activation
likelihood in the fronto-parietal network (right pars
triangularis, posterior-medial frontal lobe, middle frontal
gyrus, precuneus, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC) and pars triangularis). These results are in
accordance with the activation detected in the studies by
Hobeika et al. (2016) and Prado, Chadha and Booth (2011).
The largest cluster was found in the right precuneus (16800
mm3). The weighted center of this cluster is located in the
frontal precuneus which is assumed to be involved in mental
imagery (Cavanna & Trimble, 2006). The second largest
cluster (6256mm3) was found in the left pars triangularis,
also known as DLPFC. It is known to be involved in
working memory and relational integration (Waltz et al.,
1999), as well as speech and language production (Foundas,
Eure, Luevano & Weinberger, 1998)
Furthermore, activation was found in the right basal
ganglia (BA 13), which are involved in reasoning and rule
application (Melrose, Poulin & Stern, 2007), a demand
inductive reasoning tasks pose. Additionally, activation was
found in the occipital lobe (left middle occipital gyrus).
Prado, Chadha and Booth (2011) did not find such
activation for relational reasoning, though they only
considered deductive reasoning tasks. This reliable
activation pattern might be due to the portion of tasks with
visual contents which are not considered classical deduction
tasks. In contrast to Prado, Chadha and Booth (2011),
Hobeika et al. (2016) and Wendelken et al. (2008), we did
not find any activation of the RLPFC. A rather surprising
result when considering the consistent reports thereof in the
literature.

Visuospatial relational processing is executed by
prefrontal activation
In visuospatial relational reasoning, the fronto-parietal
network exhibited activation as well. Activation was mainly
found in the left pars triangularis (BA 44) and posterior
medial frontal (BA 9) and the inferior parietal lobule (hIP3)
and right middle frontal gyrus (BA 45). This suggests that
visuospatial relational reasoning is rather mediated by
prefrontal activation, considering the multitude of clusters
across the PFC. Also, parietal activation in the inferior
parietal lobule (IPL) was found, suggesting that visuospatial
processing does more heavily rely on context related
processes than on mental imagery.

Abstract relational reasoning relies on the
intraparietal sulcus
In the abstract reasoning condition, we found activation in
the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and left IPL. Since the
analysis consisted of 10 studies only, the results are sparse.
Nonetheless, they indicate that the IPL is essential for

3513

abstract relational reasoning. Since the IPL is known to be
involved in abstraction (Wurm & Lingnau, 2015), this might
imply the IPL’s crucial role in the abstraction of contents
from relational information.

Conclusion
The meta-analysis unraveled some crucial details about
the neural mechanisms of relational reasoning. Our results
suggest that relational reasoning heavily relies on mental
imagery and representation as well as a multitude of regions
in the prefrontal cortex such as the DLPFC for relational
integration and pars triangularis for language processing. No
significant activation in the RLPFC was found, opposed to
predictions by previous studies. We found striking
differences between the type of representation of relations,
so that visuospatial relations seem to rather rely on context,
opposed to abstract relations which rely on abstraction of
relation and mental imagery. Since the inclusion criteria
concerning stimulus presentation and task requirements
were relaxed, we assume that these areas mediate the
general process of relational reasoning.
