motion paths allows us to compare not only the use of ‘front’
and ‘back’ adpositions (prepositions and postpositions)
across the languages in our sample but also the use of
functional information (occlusion/visibility) encoded in
verbs (see Landau & Jackendoff, 1993; Miller & Johnson-
Laird, 1976; Talmy, 1983, on the role of spatial verbs). To
ensure cross-linguistic validity, we include both satellite-
framed languages that tend to encode motion paths in
particles/non-verb elements, and verb-framed languages that
tend to encode motion path information in the verb (Talmy,
1985). In study 1, we compare English (a satellite-framed
language) to Greek (a verb-framed language). In study 2, our
language sample contains an equal number of verb-framed
and satellite-framed languages. For completeness in path
descriptions, each Front or Back path has a goal variant (e.g.,             Figure 1: Schematic examples of test events. In
