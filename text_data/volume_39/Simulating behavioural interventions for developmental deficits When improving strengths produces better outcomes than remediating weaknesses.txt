Abstract

difficult to apply causal principles to the complex
therapeutic situation involving treatment of the whole child
via a social interaction with the therapist. Nevertheless, it
remains an important ambition to narrow the gap between
theories of deficit and practices of intervention.

Computational models of cognitive development have been
frequently used to model impairments found in developmental
disorders but relatively rarely to simulate behavioural
interventions to remediate these impairments. One area of
controversy in practices of intervention is whether it is better
to attempt to remediate an area of weakness or to build on the
child’s strengths. We present an artificial neural network
model of productive vocabulary development simulating
children with word-finding difficulties. We contrast an
intervention to remediate weakness (additional practice on
naming) with interventions to improve strengths (improving
phonological and semantic knowledge). Remediating
weakness served to propel the system more quickly along the
same atypical trajectory, while improving strengths produced
long-term increases in final vocabulary size. A combination
yielded the best outcome. The model represents the first
mechanistic demonstration of how interventions targeting
strengths may serve to improve behavioural outcomes in
developmental disorders. The observed effects in the model
are in line with those observed empirically for children with
word-finding difficulties.

Improve strengths or remediate weaknesses?
One area of controversy in practices of intervention is
whether it is better to attempt to remediate an area of
weakness or to build on the child’s strengths. For example,
in the field of developmental language disorders, Leonard
(2014) argues that generally, therapists prefer to work on
developing compensatory strategies through targeting the
child’s strengths rather than trying to improve his or her
area of weakness (see also Bishop, Nation & Patterson,
2014).
To take a more specific case, where children have
difficulties in producing words that they already know (so
called word-finding difficulties; WFD), therapists may
simply require the child to spend more time practicing
naming, the area of weakness. Alternatively, they have the
option of targeting children’s knowledge of word sounds
(phonology) or word meanings (semantics). Therapists have
found that interventions that elaborate the semantic aspect
of words (e.g., McGregor & Leonard, 1989) or interventions
that focus on the phonological component of word finding
(e.g., Best, 2005) both alleviate WFD to some extent. In a
survey, Best (2003) asked therapists what kind of
difficulties they found most often co-occurring with WFD in
the children they saw. Phonological problems were reported
to co-occur 46% of the time, while semantic problems cooccurred only 13% of the time. Nevertheless, when asked
which types of intervention they most often used, therapists
reported more often using techniques to improve semantic
knowledge than phonology (79% of the time compared to
54%). In this case, then, therapists frequently sought to
buttress areas of strength to improve naming skills.
One explanation for the tendency of therapists to work
less on areas of weakness and more often on areas of
strength is to improve the child’s confidence in a domain

Introduction
Theories of deficits versus theories of intervention
In the field of developmental disorders, there are extensive
theories about the causes of behavioural deficits. However,
these have played a relatively small role in intervention
practices. Indeed, theories of treatment have often
developed relatively independently of theories of deficit
(Laws et al., 2008; Michie & Prestwich, 2010). The gap
between a mechanistic understanding of the causes of
deficits and everyday therapeutic practice exists for a
number of reasons. Most obviously, the primary focus of
intervention is on behavioural outcomes, which do not in
themselves necessitate an understanding of underlying
cause. In addition, there are diverse real-world constraints
influencing the interventions that are selected. And it is

63

where he or she is struggling. However, from a theoretical
perspective, one might ask through what mechanisms could
improving a strength serve to remediate a behavioural
impairment in a developing cognitive system?
There are at least three ways that improving a strength
could remediate a behavioural impairment. First, the
‘strength’ could represent an alternative cognitive system or
pathway to deliver a similar behavioural outcome.
Improving a strength then translates to encouraging a
compensatory strategy. Second, the target behavior may be
delivered by an interactive system in which multiple sources
of knowledge combine to drive behavior. Stronger input
from one source might then make up for weaker input from
another. Third, the target behavior may require mappings to
be learned between representations. Improving the structure
of the representations might serve to make learning those
mappings easier. In this article, we use computational
modeling to investigate the third of these options.

phonological representations emerging in self-organizing
maps (e.g., Li, Zhao & MacWhinney, 2007; Mayor &
Plunkett, 2010). Best et al. (2015) used a similar approach,
but implemented the semantic and phonological components
of the model via 3-layer autoassociator networks trained
using backpropagation (Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams,
1986). The hidden unit representations of the semantic
component were then mapped to the hidden units of the
phonological component, via an intermediate layer of
hidden units, to provide a pathway for the development of
naming. A reverse pathway simulated comprehension.
Naming behavior began to emerge while the semantic and
phonological representations were themselves still
developing. By restricting learning in the semantic
component, the phonological component, or the pathway
between them (for example, by reducing hidden unit
numbers or the learning rate), Best et al. were able to
capture various patterns of atypical naming development
observed in a sample of children with WFD.

Computational modeling of interventions

Simulations

Computational modeling, particularly the use of artificial
neural networks, has been extensively applied to
understanding the mechanisms underlying developmental
deficits, in disorders such as dyslexia, Specific Language
Impairment, and autism (Thomas & Karmiloff-Smith,
2002). Relatively few models of developmental deficits
have been extended to the simulation of behavioural
interventions to remediate these deficits, and the framework
for doing so has only recently been laid out (Thomas et al.,
2017). Two notable exceptions are Harm, McCandliss and
Seidenberg’s (2003) simulation of an intervention for
dyslexia, and Best et al.’s (2015) model of interventions for
productive vocabulary deficits. In both cases, a typical
model established the developmental trajectory under
normal circumstances; an atypical model was created in
which a computational constraint limited development; and
a behavioural intervention was simulated by adding further
input-output mappings to the model’s training set for a
discrete period, usually relatively early during training.
Here, we adapt Best et al.’s model of vocabulary
development to contrast the effects of improving strengths
versus remediating weaknesses.

Simulation design
Using the same architecture, we followed the Best et al.
(2015) model in simulating productive vocabulary
development in children with WFD by restricting the
computational capacity of the pathway mapping between
semantic and phonological representations. The semantic
and phonological components themselves developed
typically. Early in development – when slow vocabulary
growth was already detectable – a behavioural intervention
was applied for a limited period during training. Five
different interventions were contrasted, of three types: (1)
remediating the weakness – the model was provided with
additional training on the naming pathway; (2) improve the
strength – the model was provided with additional training
to improve the semantic representations, the phonological
representations, or both at once; (3) both types 1 and 2 were
combined into an intervention that sought to simultaneously
improve strength and remediate weakness. We observed the
immediate effect of intervention, in terms of potentially
accelerated vocabulary growth, and the eventual outcome, in
terms of the largest vocabulary size achieved following each
type of intervention.
The original Best et al. (2015) model used a fairly abstract
rendition of semantics and phonology and a training set of
only 100 items. Here, we used more realistic semantic and
phonological representations, and scaled up the training set
slightly to around 400 items. The typically developing
model was designed in such a way that it reflected salient
properties
of
vocabulary
growth,
including
a
comprehension-production asymmetry (Bloom, 1973) and a
vocabulary explosion / exponential growth in vocabulary
size (e.g., McMurray, 2014).
The model contained three assumptions not in the Best et
al. (2015) model. First, phonological representations were
required to be more accurate than semantic outputs to drive

Connectionist models of vocabulary development
Sentence production involves a sequence beginning with a
planned message, followed by selection of major lexical
concepts, assigning syntactic functions, assembling
phonologically realized words and morphemes into a
sentence frame, and programming articulatory processes
(e.g., Bock & Levelt, 1994). Connectionist models of word
production have tended to focus on the step involving the
retrieval of phonological forms given a semantic
specification of the desired lexical item (e.g., Dell,
Schwartz,
Martin,
Saffran,
&
Gagnon,
1997).
Developmental models have simulated the learning of
mappings between pre-specified semantic and phonological
codes (e.g., Plunkett et al., 1992), or between semantic and

64

deviation of .15 was added to the net input of units in the
components, and noise with a standard deviation of .05 in
the pathways, to provide a stochastic basis for naming errors
in normal functioning. Continuous activation values on the
phonological output were converted to responses by finding
the nearest legal phoneme in each slot and assessing
whether the full phoneme string was the correct name. If the
average root mean square error between the activation
vector for each phoneme and the nearest legal phoneme
code exceeded 0.03, that phoneme was coded as no
response. A nearest neighbor technique was also used to
assess the accuracy of semantic outputs. These parameters
were selected to calibrate the typical model.

a behavioural response, under the assumption that
phonological output needs to drive motor assemblies, while
semantic comprehension only requires that the output fall in
the correct attractor basin (Hinton & Shallice, 1991). This
assumption generated the production-comprehension
asymmetry.
Second, we implemented a sensitive period in the
development of the components but not the pathways in the
model, through pruning of network connectivity after a
given point in development. This created the potential for
early training to create enriched lower level representations
by utilizing the then-available rich connectivity. Pathways
did not experience this pruning, under the view that
sensitive periods are characteristic of lower but not higher
cognitive systems (Takesian & Hensch, 2013). The effect of
timing of intervention was subsequently evaluated.
Third, plasticity was set higher in the pathways than the
components (via the learning rate parameter), so that the
development of semantic and phonological representations
would be the limiting factor on the development of naming.
If the semantic and phonological representations were to
quickly reach ceiling before naming had developed,
interventions targeting phonology and semantics would
have no scope to improve naming performance. The effects
of both the second and third assumptions were evaluated by
also running the model in their absence.
Finally, we explored whether the five types of
intervention would enhance performance in a typically
developing model, or whether they only had the potential to
improve performance in systems exhibiting delayed
development.

Figure 1: Architecture of the productive vocabulary
model, with phonological and semantic components and
linking pathways
Training set: The training set comprised 397 words, each
with a phonological and a semantic representation. It was
generated by combining two sources, a set of 1029 speaker
generated semantic feature norms for 456 words collected
by Vinson and Vigliocco (2008) from 280 adults; and the
Children’s Printed Word Database (Masterson et al., 2010),
which is an online database of the vocabulary in reading
materials used by 5-9 year old children in the UK. The 397
words represent those present in both resources. The
semantic representations comprised the 1029 feature set,
where a feature was set to 1 if any adult rated it as a
characteristic of a given word meaning, and 0 otherwise.
The phonological representations used a 19-bit articulatory
code for phonemes (Thomas & Karmiloff-Smith, 2003) and
a left-justified slot-based CCCVVCCC syllabic scheme to
capture words up to three syllables in length, with 3x8x19 =
456 phonological features in total.
Training schedule: Networks were trained for 1000
epochs, with random presentation and pattern update.
Training of autoassociators and pathways was interleaved.
Weights were updated using the backpropagation algorithm
with the cross entropy error measure.
Simulation of interventions: For atypical networks, an
intervention began at 100 epochs of training and lasted for
100 epochs. For the main condition, at this point TD models
had acquired a productive vocabulary size of 67 words,
while atypical models had a vocabulary size of 36 words.

Simulation details
Architecture: The architecture of the vocabulary
development model is shown in Figure 1. It comprised four
linked backpropagation networks. The semantics component
comprised a 3-layer autoassociator with 1029 input and
output units and 45 hidden units. The phonology component
was an autoassociator with 456 input and output units and
60 hidden units. The naming pathway linked the semantic
hidden units with the phonological hidden units via an
intermediate layer of 175 units. Naming constituted
activating semantic inputs and measuring phonological
outputs. The comprehension pathway ran in the other
direction and also contained 175 units. In the atypical
model, the number of hidden units in the naming pathway
was reduced to 90 prior to training.
Additional parameters: The learning rate in the semantic
component was .015 and in the phonological component
was .025. In the pathways, the learning rate was .15.
Sigmoid activation functions had a temperature of 1.5 in the
components and 1 in the pathways. In the components, after
epoch 75, any connection weights with an absolute
magnitude of less than .5 had a 5% chance of being
permanently removed each epoch. Initial weights were
given random values via a Gaussian distribution with mean
0 and standard deviation 0.5. Gaussian noise with a standard

For the intervention, one or more components or pathways
were trained with 5 times the frequency of the rest of the
system. The extra training could be on the semanticsphonology naming pathway, the semantics component
alone, the phonological component alone, both semantics
and phonological components, or all of these combined.
Conditions: To test the importance of timing,
interventions were compared at 100, 250 and 750 epochs.
To test the effect of plasticity assumptions in the model, the
first variant removed connectivity pruning from the
components. The second variant removed the higher
plasticity of the pathways, setting their value to .025.
Replications: All conditions were replicated three times
with different random seeds. The full design took
approximately 100 days of simulation time. Results graphs
are shown averaged over replications; individual data are
included in the following tables.

contains the combined strength-and-weakness intervention.
The combined intervention showed the initial immediate
gains of the remediation intervention as well as the longterm elevated final level of the strengths intervention. Figure
5 includes the effects of these interventions on typically
developing models. Extra practice in naming accelerated
development but did not raise the final level. Extra
elaboration of semantic and phonological representations by
contrast increased the final productive vocabulary size even
for the typically developing networks.
Tables 1 and 2 show the final level performance, split by
replication, contrasting the intervention targeting weakness
(Naming), the intervention targeting strengths (S+P), and
the intervention targeting both strengths and weaknesses
(Both). Table 1(a) contains the data for the above base
condition; 1(b) demonstrates that when plasticity reductions
in the components were removed as a model assumption,
the same pattern of results held. Table 1(c) shows that
without the assumption of greater plasticity in the pathways,
the same pattern also held. Table 2 contrasts the effect of
interventions at different points in training. The strengths
intervention (S+P) diminished in size and disappeared the
later in development it was applied. The weakness
intervention (Naming) showed the opposite pattern,
increasing in size the later it was applied. The combined
(Both) showed a uniform effect across development. Within
each condition, the three replications demonstrated a
common profile.

Results
Figure 2 displays developmental trajectories for naming and
comprehension in the typical and atypical models. For the
typical model, naming lagged behind comprehension,
exhibiting
the
expected
comprehension-production
asymmetry. Naming itself showed an accelerating rate of
development, consistent with a vocabulary explosion. The
atypical model with WFD exhibited delayed development in
naming but not comprehension (the slightly better
comprehension was just a chance difference).

immediate improvement in naming accuracy, but did not
raise the ceiling vocabulary size that could be attained by
the model. Intervention had served to propel the model more
quickly along the same atypical trajectory. This is because
the (lower) ceiling level of performance was constrained by
the reduced computational capacity of the naming pathway.
By contrast, either improving the semantics representations
or the phonological representations – which were otherwise
developing typically – produced slower changes during the
intervention period, but then long-term gains in the size of
the productive vocabulary that the model could acquire.
Improving both semantic and phonological representations
together gave the largest gains. These gains occurred
because semantic and phonological representations became
more delineated (or less confusable) through additional
training, so that a pathway with limited capacity could
achieve higher accuracy. Combining intervention on
weakness and strengths gave both immediate gains during
intervention and a long-term improvement in the vocabulary
size that could be attained.

We included assumptions about plasticity in the model –
that there would be sensitive periods in the components but
not pathways, that the lower plasticity of the components
would be the limiting factor on naming development – but
neither proved essential for producing the above effect. We
also altered the timing of intervention, and here showed that
improving strengths yielded greatest gains early in
development, while remediating weaknesses yielded the

Discussion
We used an artificial neural network model of impaired
vocabulary development to explore the relative merits of a
behavioural intervention to remediate weakness versus one
to improve strengths. The two interventions yielded
contrasting patterns. The intervention to remediate the
weakness – more practice on naming itself – produced an

67

greatest gains late in development. Combining both
produced a uniform effect across development.
This model represents the first mechanistic demonstration
of how working on strengths may serve to improve
behavioural outcomes in developmental disorders. The
observed effects of improving semantic and phonological
representations are in line with those observed empirically
for children with WFD (Best, 2005; McGregor & Leonard,
1989). Two further methods by which improving strengths
might improve behavioural outcomes remain to be explored:
encouraging
compensatory
mechanisms
through
intervention, and bolstering convergent sources of
information in interactive systems.
The model nevertheless demonstrated relatively modest
accuracy gains through intervention – certainly there was no
elimination of the deficit (it was reduced from 35% to 29%).
This is in line with general arguments made by Thomas et
al. (2017): with some exceptions, where deficits arise
through neurocomputational constraints in developing
systems, behavioural interventions alone are unlikely to be
successful in fully alleviating deficits. The conditions of
optimal outcome are, however, a fruitful avenue for
computational investigations, in the wider context of
narrowing the gap between mechanistic theories of deficit
and clinical practices of intervention.
