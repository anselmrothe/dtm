measurement block’s time limit ensured that subjects could
work through the complete design matrix, that is one of
those 5 sets, at least one time.
   To realize the adaptive hysteresis manipulation, we
calculated the subjects’ individual discounting curve from
which we adaptively derived trials compatible to the
respective hysteresis manipulation (see Results). The
structure of an adaptive hysteresis manipulation is to
sequentially change subjects’ preference from the SS
towards the LL option, or vice versa. In our adaptive trial
sequences, we aimed to change subjects’ preference in 12
steps as indicated by the differences between the subjective
value ratio (SS/LL) in the trials and the indifference points
