Abstract
Disfluencies such as self-repairs, filled pauses such as ‘um’
and silent pauses are pervasive in dialogue, but there is no consensus in the literature as to whether they reflect internal production pressures, or interactive issues – or how their effects
are manifest in dialogue. It is well-known that patients with
schizophrenia have problems with language and social cognitive skills, yet little research has investigated how these impact
interaction. We report a study on the disfluency behaviours of
patients with schizophrenia and their interlocutors who were
unaware of the patient’s diagnosis, compared to healthy control groups. Results show that patients use fewer self-repairs
than either their partners or controls and fewer filled pauses
(‘er’, ‘um’) than controls. Furthermore, the presence of the patient also affects patients’ partners, who use fewer filled pauses
than controls and more unfilled pauses than both patients and
controls. This suggests that smooth coordination of turns is
problematic in patients’ dialogues.

Introduction
Disfluencies, such as self-repair, pauses and filler non-words
such as er and um (filled pauses) are pervasive in dialogue
(Schegloff, Jefferson, & Sacks, 1977). Such disfluencies are
conventionally regarded as symptomatic of problems with
communication, caused by self-monitoring or production issues (Levelt, 1983). However, disfluencies also highlight the
interactive nature of dialogue – many disfluencies occur as
we tailor our talk for specific addressees, or as a direct result
of feedback from our interlocutors (Goodwin, 1979).
Furthermore, different types of disfluencies have been hypothesised to contribute differently to the individual and
shared actions that must be coordinated in successful dialogue. For example, in route following experiments, different distributions of filled pauses and self-repairs suggest
that self-repairs occur because of production difficulties, but
filled pauses fulfil an interpersonal function (Bortfeld, Leon,
Bloom, Schober, & Brennan, 2001; Nicholson, Eberhard, &
Scheutz, 2010; Brennan & Schober, 2001).
Other research suggests that disfluencies should be categorised according to whether they make changes to the meaning of an utterance or not, e.g. reformulations and false starts
are backwards-looking disfluencies, whilst word repetitions
and filled pauses are forwards-looking (Ginzburg, Fernández,
& Schlangen, 2014; Allwood, Nivre, & Ahlsén, 1990).
In addition to signalling difficulties that the speaker may
be experiencing, different types of disfluency have been
shown to have conventionalised meanings with respect to
turn-taking. Filled pauses may indicate a break in the information (for example while the speaker searches for a word

or phrase) but an intention to retain the floor, whilst unfilled
pauses may signal that the speaker does not intend to continue
speaking (Clark & Fox Tree, 2002; Allwood et al., 1990).
Recent work suggests that disfluencies have measurable effects on the dialogue – even if this is not necessarily the intention of the speaker (Finlayson & Corley, 2012; Ginzburg et
al., 2014). For example, in contexts where informational exchange is key, such as the Map Task (Anderson et al., 1991),
more self-repair may be indexing one’s own production difficulties, and how hard people are working to be understood
by (and for) their interlocutors (Colman & Healey, 2011).
Further evidence that disfluencies do not just function as
markers of miscommunication but contribute to improving
the effectiveness of interaction comes from psycholinguistic
studies. For example, referential success and ambiguity resolution are aided by the presence of disfluencies (Brennan &
Schober, 2001; Bailey & Ferreira, 2007). Communications
training interventions also indicate that talk between psychiatrists and patients with schizophrenia is improved when the
psychiatrist uses more self-repair (McCabe et al., 2016).
As can be seen from the above discussion, there is no general consensus in the literature about either which disfluencies should be focused on, how different types of disfluency
should be categorised, or the effects they have in dialogue.
It is well documented that people with a diagnosis of
schizophrenia have problems with language and social cognitive skills, including with self-monitoring (Johns et al., 2001)
and turn-taking (using role-play; Mueser, Bellack, Douglas,
and Morrison, 1991), yet little research has investigated how
these impact interaction. The few studies that do find that
less patient self-repair is associated with verbal hallucinations
(Leudar, Thomas, & Johnston, 1992), more patient otherinitiated repair (clarification of the doctor’s talk) is associated with better adherence to treatment (McCabe et al., 2013),
and clinicians’ use of self-repair has positive clinical consequences (McCabe et al., 2016). Research into disfluencies
therefore has the potential to be used in diagnostic tools, and
feed into training for psychiatrists to detect when a patient is
in difficulty or shape their own talk more effectively.
However, there is conflicting evidence regarding disfluencies in patients with schizophrenia and whether this differs
from non-clinical populations. In consultations, patients use
more self-repair than psychiatrists (McCabe et al., 2013) and
this is higher than found in general dialogue in the demographic portion of the British National Corpus, or Map Task
dialogues (Howes, Purver, McCabe, Healey, & Lavelle, 2012;

2230

Colman & Healey, 2011). This might be expected in the clinical domain where patients are explaining and providing updates on their health and treatment. In contrast, in a controlled study where subjects described the experimenters actions, frequency of repair did not differ between patients and
matched controls (Leudar et al., 1992).
These differences may reflect interactional factors, such as
domain, or role, and not differences between schizophrenia
patients and non-clinical populations per se. Additionally, in
these studies, patients’ interlocutors were aware of their diagnosis, which could have influenced the way they interacted
with the patient (Doyen, Klein, Pichon, & Cleeremans, 2012).
We report an analysis of a unique corpus of 40 triadic dialogues (Lavelle, Healey, & McCabe, 2013) that avoids these
potential confounds (see Method, below). Given that the literature suggests patients produce more self-repairs than their
psychiatrists in dialogues during clinical consultation, and
more so than people in natural corpora from the general population, and with the assumption that turn-taking cues (including offering the floor to another participant, or retaining it for
oneself) partially consist of filled and unfilled pauses (Maclay
& Osgood, 1959), we expect the following:

Patients were recruited at routine psychiatric outpatient
clinics under supervision of their psychiatrist. 25% of all
patients approached agreed to participate. Patients were taking anti-psychotic medication which fell within the low dose
range (Chlorpromazine equivalents 50-200mg/day). Nonnative English speakers and patients presenting with motor
side effects from antipsychotic medication were excluded
based on a clinician’s assessment.
The distribution of gender did not significantly differ between patient and control conditions (P: n = 60: female
= 53.33%, C: n = 60: female = 43.33%; χ2 = 1.20, p =
0.27). Patients were significantly older than controls (P:
M = 41s.d. = 8.6, C: M = 31s.d. = 9.6; t119 = 4.51, p < 0.01)
Symptoms were assessed using the Positive And Negative
Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (Kay, Flszbein, & Opfer,
1987). Patients displayed relatively low PANSS scores for
positive symptoms – additional features that occur with the
disorder such as hallucinations or delusional beliefs (M =
15.8; s.d. = 6.76), and negative symptoms, which represent a
reduction in usual function such as social withdrawal, diminished affect, apathy and anhedonia (M = 9.95; s.d. = 3.36).

Hypotheses

All procedures were approved by a UK NHS Research Ethics
Committee (07/H0711/90). All participants gave written informed consent and were free to withdraw at any time.

1. Compared to healthy control conversational groups and
their healthy conversational partners, patients will produce
more disfluent talk, with more self-repairs.
2. Compared to controls and their conversational partners, patients will produce fewer turn-taking cues (filled and unfilled pauses).
3. Compared to patients and controls, patients’ partners will
produce more turn-taking cues.

Method
Participants
The data consist of transcripts of twenty patient interactions,
involving one patient conversing with two healthy controls
who were unaware of the patient’s diagnosis, and twenty control interactions (3 healthy participants). Twenty patients with
a diagnosis of schizophrenia (6 male, 14 female) and one hundred non-psychiatric healthy participants, forty in the patient
condition (21 m, 19 f) and sixty in the control condition (34
m, 26 f), participated. Participants within each triad were unfamiliar to each other. Due to technical issues one patient
interaction and one control conversation could not be transcribed and are excluded from the analysis, resulting in data
from 57 individuals in control groups (19 triads), and 19 patients and 38 healthy controls in patient interactions.
Non-psychiatric healthy participants were recruited
through advertising on local community websites. Of those
who responded to the advertisement, 40% participated. Participants with a diagnosis of psychosis or affective disorders
in themselves, or any first-degree relatives, and those who
were not fluent English speakers were excluded.

Ethics

Procedure
Participants were brought into the laboratory in threes and
seated in a triangular formation so that they all had good visual access to each other (see Figure 1). The researcher read
aloud a fictional moral dilemma, the ‘balloon task’ (see Task
section, below), which has been used for studying dialogue,
and is known to stimulate discussion (Howes, Purver, Healey,
Mills, & Gregoromichelaki, 2011). The group was provided
with an opportunity to ask questions before the researcher left
the interaction space and the task began. Interactions ended
when participants reached a joint decision. Groups that failed
to reach agreement had their interaction terminated at approximately 450 seconds (7 minutes 30 seconds).

Task

Unfilled pauses Following e.g. Zellner (1994), we defined
unfilled pauses as speech-free spaces between segments of
speech by the same speaker of greater than 200 milliseconds.
Pause segments were automatically extracted from the ELAN
transcripts. For the analyses we used a count of the number
of unfilled pauses used by each participant.
As patients produce fewer turns than their interlocutors,
per-turn rates for these measures were calculated for each individual participant as the total number of self-repairs, filled
or unfilled pauses produced divided by the total number of
turns. Patients’ turns are also typically shorter – as longer
turns are expected to have more repair (Bortfeld et al., 2001),
we also calculated measures per 100 words (see Table 1).

The balloon task is an ethical dilemma requiring agreement
on which of four passengers should be thrown out of a hot air
balloon, which is losing height and about to crash into some
mountains killing all on board unless one of them jumps to
their certain death in order to save the other three. The four
passengers are described to the participants as follows:
Dr. Robert Lewis – a cancer research scientist, who believes he is on the brink of discovering a cure for most
common types of cancer.
Mrs. Susanne Harris – who is not only widely tipped as the
first female MP for her area, but is also over the moon because she is 7 months pregnant with her second child.

Statistics Analyses were run in SPSS using Generalised
Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to control for both fixed and
random effects. In all reported models, condition was a fixed
effect and participant ID was a random effect with individuals clustered by their conversation group. For each model we
used random intercepts and the maximal random effect structure justified by the sample (Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily,
2013), using a gamma distribution with a log link function.
We report exact p-values throughout, but take p < 0.05 to be
the criterion of significance.

Mr. William Harris – husband of Susanne, who he loves
very much, is the pilot of the balloon, and the only one
on board with balloon flying experience.
Miss Heather Sloan – a 9 year-old music prodigy, considered by many to be a “twenty first century Mozart”.
Participants were instructed to debate the reasons for and
against each person being saved, and reach mutual agreement
about who should jump.

Analysis
Participants’ speech was transcribed in ELAN (Brugman &
Russel, 2004), allowing us to map the transcriptions to the
video and precisely time pauses.

Results

Self-repair Self-repairs were annotated automatically using STIR (STrongly Incremental Repair detection; Hough
and Purver, 2014);1 which detects speech repairs on transcripts word-by-word incrementally. It uses a pipeline of classifiers to tag each word of the transcript as either fluent, or in
an element of the three-part repair structure below, according
to the manual by (Meteer, Taylor, MacIntyre, & Iyer, 1995):

reparandum

(1)

interregnum repair

STIR uses features from n-gram language models in a
pipeline of classifiers which classify whether the current word
constitutes a boundary of each part of the repair structure.
STIR is trained on the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey, Holliman, & McDaniel, 1992) and achieves an F-score accuracy for self-repair detection of 0.81 on conversational data
(Howes, Hough, Purver, & McCabe, 2014). It has previously
been applied to therapeutic dialogue, with high rates of correlation to human coders in terms of self-repair rate (Howes
et al., 2014), so is adequate for our annotation purposes.

Number of turns Patients (P) produced significantly fewer
turns than their partners (PP) (t1,102 = −3.247, p = 0.001).
There was no significant difference between patients and
controls (C) or patients’ partners and controls (P/C t1,102 =
−1.574, p = 0.118; PP/C t1,102 = −0.213, p = 0.832).
Number of words Patients produced fewer words in total and per turn than either their partners or controls (Total:
P/PP t1,102 = −3.914, p < 0.001; P/C t1,102 = −2.481, p =
0.015; PP/C t1,102 = 0.172, p = 0.864; Per turn: P/PP t1,102 =
−3.823, p < 0.001; P/C t1,102 = −2.183, p = 0.031; PP/C
t1,102 = 0.979, p = 0.330).

Filled pauses In this data, filled pauses were found to be
inconsistently spelt (aammm, er, eerrrrmm, uhmmm etc). A
find-and-replace operation was applied to the corpus prior to
analysis to give these a standardised spelling, i.e. ‘er’ (Howes
et al., 2014). For the analyses we used a count of the number
of filled pauses used by each participant.

Self-repair For all three measures of repair –total, per turn
(shown in Figure 22a) and per 100 words– patients use fewer
repairs than either their partners or controls (Total: P/PP
t1,96 = −3.265, p = 0.002, P/C t1,96 = −3.394, p = 0.001,
PP/C t1,96 = −0.528, p = 0.599; per turn: P/PP t1,96 =
−3.476, p = 0.001, P/C t1,96 = −3.643, p < 0.001, PP/C
t1,96 = −0.094, p = 0.926; per 100 words: P/PP t1,102 =

t1,96 = −0.796, p = 0.428).
Filled pauses Patients use fewer filled pauses than controls, with patients’ partners levels of filled pauses lying
somewhere in between. For the total model, patients’ partners use significantly more than patients, and in the per
100 words model (shown in Figure 22b) patients’ partners use significantly fewer than controls (Total: P/PP
t1,102 = −2.685, p = 0.008, P/C t1,102 = −3.644, p < 0.001,
PP/C t1,102 = −1.751, p = 0.083; Per turn: P/PP t1,102 =
−1.310, p = 0.193, P/C t1,102 = −2.720, p = 0.008, PP/C
t1,102 = −1.729, p = 0.087; per 100 words: P/PP t1,102 =
−1.544, p = 0.126, P/C t1,102 = −3.353, p = 0.001, PP/C
t1,102 = −2.364, p = 0.020).
Unfilled pauses Patients’ partners use more unfilled pauses
in total and per turn (see Figure 22c) than either patients
or controls. This is not significant for the per 100 words
model (Total: P/PP t1,102 = −3.750, p < 0.001, P/C t1,102 =
−1.996, p = 0.049, PP/C t1,102 = 2.361, p = 0.020; Per turn:
P/PP t1,102 = −3.235, p = 0.002, P/C t1,102 = −0.750, p =
0.455, PP/C t1,102 = 2.483, p = 0.015, per 100 words: P/PP
t1,102 = −1.106, p = 0.272, P/C t1,102 = 0.644, p = 0.521,
PP/C t1,102 = 1.926, p = 0.057)

Discussion
The results show differences in disfluencies between the
groups, such that patients use fewer self-repairs than either
their partners or controls and fewer filled pauses (‘er’) than
controls. Furthermore, the presence of the patient also affects
patients’ partners, who use fewer filled pauses than controls
and more unfilled pauses than both patients and controls.
These results take a coarse-grained view of the data at the
level of the individual, and the groups are unbalanced (with

57 controls, 19 patients and 38 patients’ partners) which necessarily means that any interpretation is suggestive rather than
definitive. However, despite these caveats, we see marked differences between the ways in which the different groups use
the different types of disfluency. This suggests several avenues for research which takes a finer-grained approach, by
looking at the interactions at the level of the utterance.
For self-repairs, patients produce fewer than either their
partners or controls, which is contrary to our expectation (Hypothesis 1) given that patients are known to produce more
self-repairs than their psychiatrists in clinical consultations,
and than in the demographic portion of the British National
Corpus. This may be due to context – patients’ engagement
is likely to be higher in their psychiatric consultations, compared to first meetings with unfamiliar individuals discussing
an abstract topic. The nature of the task is clearly different,
with introspective therapy requiring different contributions
from the patients in terms of speech production and planning
than rational problem solving. Furthermore, participant roles
and task demands are more symmetric in the current task
compared to clinical consultations. However, if self-repairs
are only due to self-monitoring problems, which patients are
known to have difficulties with (Johns et al., 2001) we would
still expect consistent self-repair patterns across a range of
contexts, which does not appear to be the case.
This suggests that we may need to consider the distinction of backwards and forwards looking repair, as proposed
in Ginzburg et al. (2014). If repetitions are more like filled
pauses, and function as a turn-holding strategy whilst reformulation repairs are backwards-looking, then we expect a difference in the distributions of the different repair types such
that patients use fewer repetitions (in line with their rarer use
of filled pauses), and that self-repairs that patients do produce are likely to be reformulations, due to patients’ selfmonitoring problems. It would also be instructive to see if the
distributions in patients’ partners and controls self-repair are
equivalent. The differences in the filled pause data suggests
they might not be, which is an avenue for future research.
Partial support for Hypotheses 2 and 3 comes from the data
on pauses, although there is conflicting evidence. Patients
produce fewer filled pauses than controls, as do their part-

2233

ners when normalised by number of words. As filled pauses
may indicate a wish to retain the floor during a turn (Clark
& Fox Tree, 2002), it may be that patients are less likely to
employ these turn holding techniques. A similar pattern of
filled pauses in patients’ partners demonstrates the impact of
the presence of the patient on the behaviour of their interlocutors. The specific reason for this is unclear. It may be
due to them aligning their own talk to the speech pattern of
the patient (Garrod & Pickering, 2009) in a similar way to
alignment in nonverbal behaviours (Lavelle, Howes, Healey,
& McCabe, 2013). However, this possibility is contrary to
evidence suggesting no differences in patterns of disfluencies between monologue and dialogue (Finlayson & Corley,
2012). It may also be indicative of the reduced competition
for the floor in patient interactions, such that turn holding cues
are less necessary.

et al., 1974), in addition to the increase in within-turn pauses
observed for patients’ partners. Other turn-taking cues that
may be less likely to be responded to by patients include nonverbal behaviours such as gesture and gaze, and future work
will investigate these behaviours at points where there are unfilled pauses or potential TRPs.
The evidence suggests that smooth coordination of turns
is problematic in patients’ dialogues. We know that patients
have difficulty coordinating their nonverbal behaviour with
others, which is associated with difficulty building relationships (Kupper et al., 2015). Therefore patients’ turn-taking
difficulties may also contribute to their poor social functioning, which is one of the most debilitating and poorly understood aspects of schizophrenia. Understanding the nature of
these deficits and their interactional relevance would provide
a focus that could be targeted through psychosocial interventions, such as those that have proven effective in autism (Wert
& Neisworth, 2003). It would also provide a measurable behavioural marker of social deficit, which could be monitored
for improvement. This line of research would provide a step
change in an area of great clinical need.

The pattern of unfilled pauses supports this theory, with patients’ partners producing more than either the patients they
are interacting with, or controls, but not when normalised by
number of words, suggesting this is a difference at the level
of the turn. Taken together, this suggests a breakdown in turntaking in dialogues containing a patient. Within-turn pauses
may occur at points where patients’ partners have reached a
transition relevance place (TRP), where turn change is normally licensed (Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974), and
are expecting (or encouraging) the patient to take the floor.
In the control dialogues, turn-taking is undertaken smoothly,
hence there are fewer unfilled pauses and more floor-holding
filled pauses. Similarly, where a patient pauses, this may be
taken as a turn-change cue, resulting in patients also producing fewer unfilled pauses. The effect would then only
be apparent within patients’ partners’ turns, and could indicate that patients are less responsive to turn taking cues or
more reluctant to select as next speaker. This explanation is
consistent with the observation that patients produce fewer
turns, evidence that patients are less able to coordinate their
behaviour with others during interaction (Kupper, Ramseyer,
Hoffmann, & Tschacher, 2015; Lavelle, Healey, & McCabe,
2014), and work that suggests that one of the social skills
deficits in patients with schizophrenia manifests in poor turntaking (Mueser et al., 1991). Note however that the 200ms cut
off for unfilled pauses is arbitrary, and this analysis does not
differentiate between long and short unfilled pauses which are
expected to have different interactive consequences; for example short pauses may simply reflect within-turn phrasing,
and not turn-taking issues per se.

Conclusions
This unique data demonstrates that not only are there communication difficulties in schizophrenia but they also impact
on social interactions more broadly, thus providing new insights into the social deficits of this complex disorder. The
data also support the idea that disfluencies are communicative solutions, not problems.

In future work, we intend to exploit the fact that the current
dataset gives us the opportunity to explore turn-taking in interactions between patients and partners who are unaware of
their diagnosis directly and at a much finer-grained level. For
example, we intend to examine unfilled pause distributions
between speakers. Based on the preliminary results reported
above, we would expect that there would be more ‘inappropriate’ turn changes in the dialogues with patients (characterised in opposition to the “no gap no overlap” model; Sacks
