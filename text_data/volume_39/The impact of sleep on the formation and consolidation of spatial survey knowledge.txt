Abstract: A supporting effect of sleep on memory consolidation was reported for different contents. Here, we investigated the
influence of sleep on the transformation of previously learned route and place knowledge into survey knowledge, a more abstract
representation. The results support the assumption of both a consolidating as well as transforming effect: the wayfinding
performance in the test session - namely the usage of unfamiliar shortcuts - suggests a consolidating effect of sleep.
