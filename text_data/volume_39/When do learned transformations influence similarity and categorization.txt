Figure 1: The two transformations used during the training phase of Experiment 1. In the MOVEMENT TRAINING people
learned a non-rigid clockwise rotation transformation (top row), whereas in the COLOR TRAINING condition they learned a
color swapping rule (bottom row). For both, the image on the left shows how that transformation was defined, and the image
on the right gives an example on a particular stimulus. In this figure we use textures to display the four possibilities for each
cell. The actual stimuli were presented in color, with the four possible values being red, green, yellow and blue.
