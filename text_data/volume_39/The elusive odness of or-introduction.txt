   On each trial participants saw an inference embedded in a
pseudo-naturalistic context story. The context stories
changed on every trial, and were randomly allocated to the
inferences for each participant. The order of occurrence of
the inferences was also varied randomly for each
participant. With 8 inferences (two not reported here) and 3
probabilities (and inference 6 only being paired with a
probability of 100%), there were 22 trials overall, plus two
control trials to check whether participants were paying
attention.

involving different inferences to those in Table 1,
participants worked through the 24 trials of the experiment.
