Figure 1: An influence diagram (ID) is a directed acyclic graph over three types of nodes: state nodes (circles), decision nodes (rectangles),
and utility nodes (diamonds). Directed edges between nodes determine causal dependencies. State and utility nodes take values that depend
on the values of their parent nodes. The total utility to the decision maker is the sum over the utility nodes. Green and red utility nodes
correspond to rewards and costs respectively. The value of decision nodes is freely chosen by the decision making agent according to
