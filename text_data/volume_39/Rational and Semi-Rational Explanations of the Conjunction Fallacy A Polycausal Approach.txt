   The intensional idea of BL (or the ‘pattern idea’) can also
be applied to the simpler representation of monadic logic
(thereby linking to the literature on generics). Whereas
standard dyadic logic concerns all possible bivariate, two-
valued (T, F) patterns in a 2 × 2 matrix (cf. Fig. 4), monadic
logic concerns a single event only (a 2 × 1 matrix). The for-
