following the recognition phase (Fig.1d). In each trial,
participants viewed two sequences of objects. Each object
appeared for 500ms followed by a 500ms ISI, and each
sequence was separated by a 1000ms pause. Participants
judged whether the first or second sequence looked more
familiar based on what they saw in the exposure phase (by
pressing the “1” or “0” key for “first sequence” or “second
sequence”, respectively). One sequence was a pair (e.g., A-
B), and the other was a “foil” (e.g., A-D) composed of one
object from an original pair (e.g., A-B), and the other from a
different pair (e.g., C-D), while preserving the temporal
positions in the pairs (Fig. 1d). Each pair was tested against
each foil twice, which resulted in 16 trials in total (4 pairs ×
2 foils × 2 repetitions). Importantly, each pair and foil were
presented the same number of times at test. Thus, to
discriminate the pair from the foil, participants needed to
know which two specific objects followed each other. The
order of the trials was randomized, and whether the pair or          Figure 2: The false alarm (FA) rate and the hit rate in recognition
