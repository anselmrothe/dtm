tile surfaces as sensing materials or interfaces for electronic
devices have been explored in recent years, for example by
turning a jacket into an interface to a mobile phone (Poupyrev
et al., 2016) or by measuring biomechanical data for health-
care applications (e.g. Pacelli et al. 2006). Here we apply
a similar fabrication technique to chair covers to address the
basic question of whether it is possible to detect patterns of
conversational interaction from movements on the chair sur-
face alone.
Sensing Chairs
Informal observation suggests that people frequently change
the position of the torso, lower body, and feet during seated
conversations. These movements necessarily cause pressure
changes on the surface of the chair and are therefore poten-
tially detectable by measuring changes in resistance. Previ-
ous work has investigated the use of chairs to classify pos-            Figure 1: Reverse side of the chair cover showing sensors.

The interactions were captured on two cameras placed in dif-
ferent corners in the room. Lapel microphones were used
to facilitate speaker-specific analysis of the audio for tran-
scription. The data from the video recordings was annotated
using Elan (Brugman, Russel, & Nijmegen, 2004). Coding
focused on three key behaviours with: speaking, laughter and
backchannels. When determining speaking modes, periods
of overt speech were coded, regardless of postural and gestu-
ral changes, or nodding. But focusing on postural movement

was performed immediately prior to speaking. This makes
the start of an utterance ambiguous. For the purposes of this
