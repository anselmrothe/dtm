Abstract: Current models of visual working memory (VWM) assume that comparing memory with the environment obligato-
rily involves a spatial comparison process. Can changing task demands determine whether a spatial or non-spatial comparison
processes is employed? Study displays of three colored shapes were presented, followed by test displays of three coloured
shapes. Participants decided whether a feature changed between displays. Task-irrelevant changes to the probed itemâ€™s lo-
cations or feature bindings reduced memory performance, suggesting that participants employed spatially guided comparison
process. This finding occurred irrespective of whether participants decided about the whole display, or only a single cued
item within the display. When task-irrelevant feature changes occurred amongst uncued items, performance was unaffected by
irrelevant changes in location or feature bindings. These results suggest that participants can flexibly shift comparison strat-
egy in response to changing task demands. These findings have implications for models of VWM, which assume obligatory
location-based comparisons in VWM.
