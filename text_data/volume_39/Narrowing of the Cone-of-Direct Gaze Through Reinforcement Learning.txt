   Simulation 2 – Developmental Trajectory of
                the Cone of Direct Gaze
   After confirming that reinforcement learning could lead to
the emergence of a CoD, we investigated the effect of
reinforcement learning on the CoD over time to see if it
could also explain known developmental changes.
Methods
   In order to get a measure of the width of the induced
CoD, the mean fixation duration and the number of gaze
follows were overlaid and their intersects calculated. To
achieve this, it was first necessary to rescale the feature so     Figure 6. Change in the width of the CoD effect as a
