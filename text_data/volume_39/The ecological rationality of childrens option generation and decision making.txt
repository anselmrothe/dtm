Abstract

Option generation

In everyday life, before deciding what to do, one has to think
about what could be done. We investigate option generation
from a developmental perspective, testing the predictions of the
Take-The-First-heuristic (TTF). Moreover, we examine the
influence of time limitation on decision-making processes.
Using soccer as a testbed, 6- to 13-year-old children (N = 97)
were tested in a video-based option-generation paradigm.
Children’s performance was aligned with predictions of TTF:
Children generated a mean of 2.21 options, did so in a
meaningful way and selected the first as final option in 74%.
With shorter time, children generated fewer and higher quality
options, selected better options and more often the first option
as final decision. Further, with age, an increase of the number
of options generated and an increase in quality of the final
decisions emerged. This age effect was more pronounced with
shorter time. Implications for real-life decision-making are
discussed.

A decision-making strategy usually consists of a search, a
stopping, and a decision rule, all together defining how and
how much information has to be collected before being able
to make a decision (Gigerenzer & Todd, 1999). However,
most real-world situations require us to generate alternative
options before making a decision, rather than selecting one
from a set of options pre-defined and generated by an
experimenter (Payne, Bettmann, & Johnson, 1988).
Very little is known about how people generate options (for
an exception see e.g., Johnson & Raab, 2003), as most
research on decision-making focuses on the other three
building blocks of decision making. The Take-The-First
heuristic (TTF) is a cognitive model that captures option
generation and decision making in familiar, yet ill-defined
tasks (Johnson & Raab, 2003; Raab, 2012; Raab & Johnson,
2007). In the TTF the building blocks are formally defined as
follows: A search rule, suggesting that alternative options are
generated in order of validity meaning that subjectively better
options are generated earlier; A stopping rule, according to
which the generation phase should stop after two to three
options have been generated; A decision rule, assuming that
people should choose one of the initial options generated
(Johnson & Raab, 2003). In this sense, people would generate
a few options and select one of those, rather than exhaustively
generating and processing all possible options. However,
because those options were generated in order of validity, the
decision, although fast and frugal, would tend to be accurate.
Studies with adults and adolescents testing the predictions
of the TTF model have previously been conducted in sports
(Belling, Suss, & Ward, 2015; Raab, 2012; Ward, Ericsson,
Williams, & Williams, 2013). Indeed, because of its naturally
occurring dynamics (e.g., decisions to be made under time
pressure; many potential alternative actions to be
considered), sport is the ideal domain to test whether people
use fast-and-frugal decision-making heuristics, such as TTF.
These studies show that the performance of experienced
handball, basketball, and soccer players is pretty accurately
predicted by the TTF model: Players tended to generate

Introduction
Imagine being a young, talented soccer player. You are
running, alone, through the middle field towards the goal,
dribbling one opponent after the other. You are now 20
meters from the goal, facing the opposing defense rapidly
closing on you. What should you do? Maybe you should try
to dribble the defense, get closer to the goal and shoot from a
shorter distance? Should you try to shoot at goal from where
you are now? Or should you pass to one of your team
members – maybe Jack, approaching from the right? Or
Mike, right behind you?
Most of the time, in everyday life, before deciding what to
do, one has to think about what could be done. In this paper,
we investigate option generation from a developmental
perspective using sport as a testbed. Moreover, we examine
the influence of time limitation on option-generation and
decision-making processes.

alternative options (e.g., shoot at the goal or pass to their
teammate) in order of validity and selected as their final
decision the first option they had generated.
As for adults, most decision-making research with children
focused on information search (see Davidson, 1991, 1996;
Gregan-Paxton & Roedder John, 1995, 1997; Howse, Best,
& Stone, 2003; Ruggeri & Katsikopoulos, 2013; Ruggeri,
Olsson, & Katsikopoulos, 2015) or investigated cue-based
decision strategies (Horn, Ruggeri, & Pachur, 2016; Mata,
von Helversen, & Rieskamp, 2011). However, to our
knowledge, option generation in children has never been
studied before.

use simple, non-compensatory information-search strategies
(Davidson, 1991; Ruggeri & Katsikopoulos, 2013), and
specifically adolescent handball players have been shown to
act according to TTF (Johnson & Raab, 2003), we expect
children to make use of the TTF heuristic. Moreover, in line
with studies that investigated decision-making from a
developmental perspective and showed an increase of
selective, non-compensatory strategy use with age
(Davidson, 1991, 1996), we further expect older children to
rely more on the TTF heuristic than younger children.
Second, we explore whether and how time limitation
influences the option generation and decision making of
children. In particular, based on prior research, it is unclear
whether children would adapt their option generation and
decision-making strategies under time limitation.

Time-limitation effects on option generation and
decision making
According to the ecological rationality framework (Todd,
Gigerenzer, & ABC Research Group, 2012), no strategy is
always optimal, because the efficiency of a strategy depends
on the environmental structure. In this sense, people should
be adaptive and modify their strategies depending on how
effective they are in a given environment (de Oliveira,
Lobinger, & Raab, 2014). In many real-life situations, as in
sports, decisions have to be taken under limited time, and we
know that adults adapt to time limitation by using faster and
simpler strategies (Ben Zur & Breznitz, 1981; Payne et al.,
1988). In particular, previous studies examining the effects of
time limitation on decision-making processes have found
that, under pressure, adults tend to increase their information
processing speed (e.g., Ben Zur & Breznitz, 1981; Payne et
al., 1988) and use more non-compensatory strategies (e.g.,
Payne et al., 1988). On the same line, in a study with adult
soccer players, Belling and colleagues (2015) found that time
limitation reduced the number of task-relevant options
generated, although it did not impact the quality of players’
decisions.
What about the effects of time limitation on children’s
decision-making? We know that children are ecological
learners, able to adapt their learning strategies to the
characteristics (e.g., the statistical structure) of the task at
hand (Horn et al., 2016; Nelson, Divjak, Gudmundsdottir,
Martignon, & Meder, 2014; Ruggeri & Lombrozo, 2015),
and they do so already by age four (Ruggeri, Sim, & Xu,
2017). However, Davidson (1996) investigated the influence
of time limitation on children’s (7- to 10-year-olds)
information search behavior and found that time pressure
promoted faster, but generally not more selective searching.
In this sense, it is unclear whether children would adapt their
option generation and subsequent decision-making strategies
depending on the time available.

Method
Participants
Ninety-seven children, all male, participated in this study
(Mage = 10.49 years, SD = 1.98 years; ranging from 6.67 to
13.50 years). All participants were recruited from a
professional soccer academy in Germany. Prior to beginning
the study, written informed parental consent, and local ethical
review board approval of the study protocol, were obtained.

Materials
We used 21 video scenes of live soccer match footage (three
for the practice trials, 18 for the test trials). After a short
display of buildup play, the scenes suddenly stopped right
before the player in possession of the ball had to make a
decision. The duration of the video scenes ranged between
seven and eleven seconds, and video duration was unrelated
to the study variables (all p > .05). We adopted the same task
and materials as in Belling et al. (2015) with one difference:
Instead of using an occlusion image that displayed field lines
and the location of the ball on a blank white screen, we used
real play footage that ended in a frozen frame such that all
players are visible and the player with the ball needs to decide
(see Figure 1). We chose to end the video with a frozen frame
to provide participants with a constant, non-memory based
game situation allowing the same condition during the entire
option-generation test. Materials were presented to children
on a touchpad (size: 8.9’’).

The present study
In the present study we use soccer as a testbed for a dynamic,
real-life decision-making situation children have experience
with. In particular, we extend previous research in two ways.
First, we investigate for the first time children’s (6- to 13year-olds) option generation process, testing the predictions
of the TTF model. In general, children have been shown to

were randomly assigned to the testing sessions. Children
were asked to sit at individual desks where a tablet was
positioned. They were then introduced to the task procedure
via a standardized instructional video (duration: 2:51 min)
showing a person conducting the decision-making test for
one exemplary soccer scene. The instructional video showed
exactly which steps children were required to do on their
tablets throughout the testing procedure.
The test proceeded as follows: After viewing each of the
21 videos (see above), videos stopped and held on with a
frozen-frame, which gave the children time to generate a
maximum of six options directly marking them onto the field
via touch-pad (see Figure 1 a, b). The first three videos were
practice trials, used to familiarize participants with the test.
During this familiarization phase children could ask
clarifying questions to the experimenter. The other 18 video
scenes were used as test trials and were randomly assigned to
either the short-time (9 videos) or the long-time (9 videos)
condition. In the long-time trials, children were given 30sec
to generate options, whereas in the short-time trials
participants were given 7.5sec to generate. The order of
presentation of the test videos was randomized, irrespectively
of to which condition they were assigned. Afterwards,
participants were asked to select among the options they had
generated the one they thought was the best (see Figure 1 c).

Results
Results were analyzed with respect to developmental
differences on four outcomes: (1) the mean number of options
generated across all 18 tests; (2) quality of the generated
options; (3) quality of the selected options; (4) participants’
dynamic inconsistency, which is the rate at which children
selected as the best option the one they had generated at first.
Dynamic inconsistency rates were computed as the relative
frequency that the first option was not selected by players to
be their final decision: Number of videos minus the frequency
of the first generated option being the final decision divided
by the total number of videos. Finally, we tested the effect of
the time limitation manipulation on above-mentioned
outcome variables.
To assess the quality of (2) the options generated and (3)
option selected, two experienced youth soccer coaches
independently generated options for the 18 test videos
presented and rated the quality of each option they had
generated on a 10-point scale (from 0, ‘not at all good’, to 10
‘very good’). Overall, coaches generated a total of 104
options for the 18 test videos. That is, a total of 52 options
were generated by each coach (M = 2.89 options per coach
per video). Of the 52 options generated independently, 42
identical options were generated by both coaches indicating
an 81% overlap between coaches. The quality of the options
generated only by one coach or not generated by the coaches
at all was scored with 0 ‘not at all good’. Based on the
moderate inter-rater agreement for the quality of all options
generated (ICC = .52, p = .01), quality scores for each option
were calculated by averaging coaches’ quality ratings.

generation and decision making variables.

Option Generation, Decision Making, and
Developmental Effects
Children generated a mean of 2.21 options (SD = 0.65).
Overall, the mean quality of the first option children
generated was 4.72 (SD = 0.99). We conducted a repeated
measures MANOVA with the within-subject factor serial
position of option (1-6) and quality as a dependent variable.
This analysis revealed that children generated options in a
meaningful way indicated by a significant decline of option
quality across the serial position, Greenhouse-Geisser
corrected F(2.70, 259.43) = 859.56, p < .001, ηp² = .90.
The mean quality of the option selected as the best was 4.45
(SD = 1.06). Most importantly, children selected the first
generated option as the best one in 74% of the cases (SD =
18.59). Compared to options generated at later serial
positions, the first option generated was selected to be the
final decision more frequently, χ² (5) = 4411.70, p < .001.
This was reflected in a dynamic inconsistency rate (i.e., the
mismatch between the first option generated and final
decision) of 0.26 (SD = .19). This is a relatively low value,
considering that a random selection would have resulted in a
dynamic inconsistency rate of 0.55, resulting from: 1 – (1 /
2.21). The more options children generated, the higher was
the dynamic inconsistency of their decisions, r = .555, p <
.001.
Separate linear regression analyses revealed that children’s
age was a significant positive predictor of all optiongeneration and most decision-making variables, except for
dynamic inconsistency (R² = .02, p = .138). The older the
children, the more options they generated (R² = .06, p = .019,
β = .24), and the higher was the quality of the first option
generated (R² = .19, p < .001, β = .44) as well as that of the
option selected as the best (R² = .10, p = .002, β = .31).

Children generated their first option in a meaningful way:
in the short-time condition, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected
F(2.35, 225.77) = 567.40, p <.001, ηp² =.86, and in the longtime condition, F(3.09, 296.81) = 489.89, p <.001, ηp² =.84,
a significant decline of option quality across the serial
position was apparent. Most importantly, children selected
their first option to be the final decision in 71.1% (n = 621)
of the decisions in the long-time condition and significantly
more often in 77.8% (n = 679) of the decisions in the shorttime condition, χ²(1, N = 97) = 11.60, p = .001, r = .16.
In both conditions, the first option generated was selected
to be the final decision more frequently, in the short-time,
χ²(5, N = 97) = 1982.61, p < .001, v = .67, and in the longtime condition, χ²(5, N = 97) = 2444.15, p < .001, v = .75. For
both time-limitation conditions, children’s decision making
was more dynamically inconsistent the more options they
generated (short-time condition: r = .448, no time limitation:
r = .581). Further, separate linear regression analyses were
conducted for each time-limitation condition. Results
revealed that the total number of options children generated
predicted the degree of dynamic inconsistency in both
conditions: The more options children generated in the shorttime, β = .58, t(95) = 6.95, p < .001, R² = .33, or in the longtime condition, β = .45, t(95) = 4.88, p < .001, R² = .19, the
more dynamic inconsistent were their decisions.
We tested further whether age was differentially predictive
when time is limited. In the short-time condition, children’s
age was a significant positive predictor of all optiongeneration and most decision-making variables, except for
dynamic inconsistency (R² = .01, p = .245, β = .12). With time
limitation, the older the children, the more options they
generated (R² = .11, p = .001, β = .33) and the higher the
quality of the first option generated (R² = .13, p < .001, β =
.36) as well as that of the option selected as best (R² = .10, p
= .002, β = .31). For the long-time condition, no age effect
was found on the number of options generated (R² = .02, p =
.153, β = .15), the quality of the final option selected as best
(R² = .04, p = .057, β = .19) and on dynamic inconsistency
(R² = .02, p = .130, β = .16), but the older the children the
higher the quality of the first option in the short-time
condition (R² = .13, p < .001, β = .36).

Time Limitation Effects
To explore whether and how time limitation influenced the
option generation and decision making of children, we
performed a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
with one within subject factor time limitation (short-time vs.
long-time condition) and four dependent variables (number
of options generated, quality of the first option, quality of
selected option and dynamic inconsistency). The repeatedmeasures MANOVA showed a significant multivariate
effect, Wilks’s Lambda λ = .20, F(5, 92) = 34.50, p < .001,
ηp² = .62. Follow-up univariate effects were further inspected
for each decision-making variable separately.
In the short-time condition, as compared to the long-time
condition, children generated fewer options, F(1, 96) =
127.51, p < .001, ηp² = .57, generated first options with higher
quality, F(1, 96) = 15.19, p < .001, ηp² = .14, and selected
options of higher quality as their final, best decisions, F(1,
96) = 16.55, p < .001, ηp² = .15. With shorter time, dynamic
inconsistency was less apparent than in the long-time
condition, F(1, 96) = 14.39, p < .001, ηp² = .13.

Discussion
Little, if anything, is known about how children generate
options about which actions can be taken in real-life
situations. To address this question, we tested the option
4

generation and decision making of children based on the
predictions of the TTF heuristic. In addition, the influence of
time limitation on option generation and decision making was
explored. This allowed deepening our understanding of the
adaptive relation between time limitation as one relevant
environmental factor and the decision-making process
predicted by TTF heuristic as argued from an ecological
rationality perspective. In an experiment, children between
the age of six and 13 years were tested in a video-based soccer
decision-making task involving a within-subject timelimitation manipulation.
First, we investigated children’s (6- to 13-year-olds) option
generation process for the first time. Testing the TTF model
revealed that predictions of the TTF heuristic also hold for
children. In the option generation phase, as expected, children
generated between two and three options, did so in a
meaningful, non-random way and selected their first option
as the final decision in more than 50% of the cases. Further,
children’s option generation influenced their decisions
making: the more options children generated, the more
dynamically inconsistent they decided. The pattern of results
in children mainly matches option-generation and decisionmaking processes that have previously been demonstrated in
adolescents and adults (Belling et al., 2015; Johnson & Raab,
2003). The results are also consistent with findings showing
that already schoolchildren use decision heuristics that match
the task at hand (e.g., Horn et al., 2016).
Second, we explored whether and how time limitation
influenced the option generation and decision making of
children. Because of its naturally occurring dynamics, the
sports domain is the ideal testbed to investigate situational,
real life influence like time limitation. Our results revealed
that time limitation affected all decision-making variables. In
response to limited time, children generated fewer options,
were less inconsistent in their decisions, generated higher
quality first options and selected higher quality options as
final decisions. This last result differs from what found with
adult soccer players, whose quality of option generation and
selection was not enhanced in response to time limitation
(Belling et al., 2015). However, the positive effect of time
limitation on children’s option quality demonstrated in the
present study theoretically matches predictions of the TTF
heuristic and fits with the ecological rationality perspective
(Johnson & Raab, 2003; Todd et al., 2012). Compatible with
the notion of “less-is-more”, the time constraint prompted the
generation of fewer but better options. Our results are also
consistent with studies demonstrating that children are indeed
ecological learners and speak for an adaptation of strategy use
to the situation or task at hand (Horn et al., 2016; Ruggeri &
Lombrozo, 2015).
Finally, we found consistent developmental effects on both
option generation and decision making: The number of
options generated increased with age, but only in the shorttime condition. This short-time specific age effect hints at a
developmental advantage for older children. With increasing
age, children seem to adapt to time limitation by speeding up
their generation to still produce a valid amount of options

they can choose from (M(SD)time limitation = 2.00 (0.46)),
whereas younger children do not (M(SD)time limitation =
1.67(0.60)). In addition, older children seem to focus more on
relevant, high-quality options early in the generation,
irrespective of time limitation. This was indicated by the
quality of the first option generated increasing with children’s
age irrespective of time limitation. In line with results
showing that the information-search behavior of younger
children (7- to 10-year-olds) was not more selective
(Davidson, 1996), this study showed that selectivity for highquality information during generation seems to emerge later
in childhood. For the quality of the final decision, as for the
number of options, an increase with age was only apparent
under limited time. This could be interpreted as a stronger
adaption to time limitation by applying a strict, selective
decision rule or applying it, according to the TTF heuristic,
more accurately (Johnson & Raab, 2003). Summing up, we
showed that children adapted to the situational demands of
time limitation by relying more on the simple TTF heuristic.
In conclusion, the present study shows that in familiar
situations children tend to use simple, intuitive option
generation and decision-making strategies. In particular,
results support that TTF as a cognitive model can account for
the option generation and decision making of children
between the age of six and 13 years. Further, the study
indicates that time limitation was an important situational
factor impacting children’s decision-making processes.
Future studies should, therefore, explore other potentially
relevant situational factors. Deepening our understanding of
environmental or situational influences would also provide a
concrete anchor for interventions targeting children’s options
and choices. Dynamic decision environments could, for
example, be manipulated by the speed, distance or amount of
stimuli provided. In particular, effects of situational factors
on children’s decision-making processes could be integrated
into computer-based or real-life interventions and tested in a
randomized control trial. Based on that, knowledge should be
incorporated into prevention (e.g. traffic education) and
training (e.g., sports, physical education) programs in a
second step.
