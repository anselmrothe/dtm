The present study
In the present study we use soccer as a testbed for a dynamic,
real-life decision-making situation children have experience
with. In particular, we extend previous research in two ways.
First, we investigate for the first time children’s (6- to 13-
year-olds) option generation process, testing the predictions
of the TTF model. In general, children have been shown to
