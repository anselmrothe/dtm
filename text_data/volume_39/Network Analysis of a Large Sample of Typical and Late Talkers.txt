           Word Frequency and Connectivity
To investigate differences in the order in which LT and TT
learn words, we examined the correlation between word order
and word frequency in CHILDES. The order in which all 291
words are learned across vocabulary size is not correlated to
word frequency for either type of talker (LT: rₛ= -.10, p= .082,
TT: rₛ= -.063, p= .28). When the same analysis is performed
on each vocabulary size bin, word order in LT was
significantly related to word frequency in vocabulary sizes of
20 to 40 words (rₛ= -.13, p= .023), and 40 to 60 words (rₛ= -
.16, p= .006). Thus, the order in which LT learn words seems
to be related to their frequency during the first stages of
vocabulary development. Further correlation analysis                Figure 4. Word frequency by vocabulary size. Numbers at
