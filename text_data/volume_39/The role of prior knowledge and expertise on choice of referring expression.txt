with other classes of models.
   Lastly, this study explores expertise in domains given
interactions about particular items. We argue that the
generalization of presumed expertise to a larger domain
given updated beliefs about particular objects is tied to
beliefs about groups of people and the presumed knowledge
of particular communities. For example, dog kennel owners
are likely to be presumed to know a lot of about dog breeds
and not so much about cat breeds. However, if the relevant
community were veterinarians, a member of that community
might be presumed to know about both dog breeds and cat
breeds. We argue that assessments about expertise are
necessarily tied to the community applied, and this constraint
is utilized by speakers to narrow in on the dimensions that are
relevant for both generalization to new interlocutors and
generalization to new items in a given domain.
