                               Results
In order to model the emergence of successful joint action
during the current pick-and-place task, the analysis was
directed towards answering two general questions. First,
what task variables determined the participants’ decision to
pickup and/or or pass. In other words, what were the
affordance (action opportunity; Gibson, 1979) based action
selection dynamics that characterized pickup and pass
behavior? Second, what were the trajectory dynamics of the
participant’s hand movements when moving to grasp,
relocate, or pass the disc within a two-dimensional task space.
Below we consider each of these questions in turn.
