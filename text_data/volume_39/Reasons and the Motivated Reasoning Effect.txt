Numeracy Average numeracy was 6.25 out of nine.
Numeracy classes were assigned by a median split, with
“high numeracy” (HN) referring to participants with
numeracy scores of 7 or above and “low numeracy” (LN)
referring to participants with numeracy scores of 6 or below.
The sizes of the resulting groups were 36 and 40,
respectively. Numeracy scores were higher in the “reasons”
condition (M = 6.58, SD = 2.39) than in the “no reasons”
condition (M = 5.92, SD = 1.75), though not significantly so;
t(67.74), p = 0.175. The difference can be attributed to CRT
items: Though not significant, the two groups differed in
