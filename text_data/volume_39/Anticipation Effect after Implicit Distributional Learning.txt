Materials
We chose three categories of stimuli: faces, buildings, and
tools. Each category has specific brain areas that reliably
respond to one of these categories but not the others (Epstein
& Kanwisher, 1998; Kanwisher, McDermott, & Chun, 1997;
Chao & Martin, 2000). The images from each of these
categories were grey-scaled and edited to be the same size
