additionally expect that speakers will be more likely to leak
privileged information when this information is salient versus
non-salient to them. That is, if speakers refer to a common-
ground figure (e.g., a circle) that has a size-contrasting match
(e.g., a bigger circle) in their privileged ground, the size
difference is relevant and, thus, salient to speakers themselves
to discern. This in contrast to situations in which speakers are
presented with a size-contrasting mismatch (e.g., a bigger
triangle) in their privileged ground. The salience of the size
contrast presented by matching rather than mismatching
figures makes speakers more likely to add contrasting
adjectives in their description of the target figure (e.g., “the
small circle”), by which they leak privileged information.
