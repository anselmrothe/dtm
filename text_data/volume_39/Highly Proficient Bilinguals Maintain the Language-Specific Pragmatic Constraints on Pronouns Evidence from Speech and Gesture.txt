Speech Coding We divided the narratives into clauses,
utterances with a single subject argument and a single
predicate. We coded only clauses with an animate subject
argument (referring to the human characters in the stimulus

maintained from the previous clause or not. We analyzed                 Figure 2: Index-finger pointing gesture referring to the

   As for gestures, based on theories suggesting that speech
and gesture parallel each other in production (Kita &
Özyürek, 2003; So et al., 2009), we expect the cross-
linguistic influence on gestures to align with patterns of
influence in speech. Alternatively, considering some L2
studies have found cross-linguistic transfer on gesture but not
on speech (Özçalışkan, 2016), we may observe cross-
linguistic influence on gesture modality only. Speakers may
extend the pragmatic marking of pronouns with gestures from
Turkish to Dutch and gesture with Dutch pronouns more
frequently than Dutch monolinguals. Alternatively,
bilinguals might loosen the pragmatic marking of gestures in
Turkish as an influence from Dutch and gesture with
pronouns less than monolinguals in Turkish.
