   The experiment had three practice blocks before the main
experiment, which consisted of 16 blocks (Figure 1). The
first practice had 20 trials. In the first practice block, we
asked participants to select the monetary value associated
with a particular color and provided feedback based on their
responses. In the second practice block, two grids were
presented that had two different colors (i.e., different
monetary amounts), but in the same proportions.                             Figure 2. Panel A: Areas of interest diagram. Panel B:

   After the speeded risky gambling task, every participant
completed a set of surveys, which included the Cognitive
Reflection Test (CRT, Frederick, 2005), DOSPERT scale
(Blais & Weber, 2006), and Holt and Laury gambles (Holt
& Laury, 2002). In this paper, we did not include the results

We observed that the probability of risky choice increased
as the ΔEV increased (Figure 3A). The probabilities of risky
choice under the three gamble pairs were different, with the
probability of risky choice under the $7-$4.5 pair being the
highest and the $7-$2 pair being the lowest. When ΔEV is
greater than zero, which indicates that the risky gamble had
a greater EV compared to the safe gamble, the risky gamble
was more likely to be chosen. We used Bayesian methods to

that their behavior might change if there was actual
monetary reward rather than a hypothetical situation. The

participants are more engaged to maximize their final
