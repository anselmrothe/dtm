Procedure
All children were tested one-on-one, seated at a table across
from the experimenter. Following a brief warm-up, the
experiementer introduced a toy that was placed on the table.
The experimenter said, “This is my toy. Some things make
my toy play music and some things do not. Let’s try some
things on my toy and find out how it works.”
   In the unfused/relational condition, children observed as
the experimenter placed a pair of ‘same’ blocks (AA’) on the
toy, causing it to activate and play music (twice). They then
observed that a pair of ‘different’ blocks (BC) failed to
activate the toy (twice). This procedure was repeated for two
additional pairs, one pair of ‘same’ (DD’) and one pair of
‘different’ blocks (EF) (see Figure 1). The ‘same’ pairs (AA’,
DD’) were composed of individual blocks that were identical
in both color and shape, and the ‘different’ pairs (BC, EF)
were composed of individual blocks distinct in both color and
shape. In the fused/single object condition, children observed
an identical presentation with one critical exception: each
pair of blocks were glued together to form single objects (A-
