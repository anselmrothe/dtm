Abstract
When learning from others, rather than simply following the
majority’s opinion, we need to accurately evaluate the quality
of the information both the majority and the minority provide,
and integrate that information with our own personal
experience. This is especially true when the majority’s opinion
is based on lower quality information, because they shared the
same evidence rather than collecting evidence independently.
Previous work demonstrated that adults are sensitive to the
quality of the majority’s information, consistent with the
predictions of a Bayesian rational model (Whalen, Griffiths, &
Buchsbaum, in press). In two behavioural experiments, we
investigated how preschoolers combine testimony from a
majority that conflicts with a minority or with the child’s own
personal evidence. Unlike adults, children over-relied on the
majority when given only testimony. However, when also
given their own conflicting evidence, children relied
significantly less on the majority and over-relied on their own
evidence. These findings help explain why children may
follow the majority at times, but in others trust their own
judgements.

Introduction
Learning from others is a valuable strategy to use when
encountering uncertainty. Human’s use of social information
is thought to underlie our ability to live in almost every
known environment, and to underpin the evolution of human
culture (Boyd & Richerson, 1985). The information we
receive from others is also integrated with the information we
gather ourselves through personal experience. Rather than
blindly following what others say, it is important we evaluate
the information we receive by understanding how others may
have formed their opinions, especially when there is
disagreement amongst individuals or when their testimony
conflicts with our own personal observations.
Evaluating informant testimony is particularly important
when the testimony is based on shared information. For
example, imagine you are reading four restaurant reviews. In
the first two reviews, the reviewers independently visited the
restaurant and ordered different dishes, and they both

recommended the restaurant. In the third and fourth reviews,
the reviewers went to the restaurant together and shared a
single dish, and then both did not recommend the restaurant.
Which set of reviews should you trust?
From a pure numbers standpoint, the number of positive
and negative reviews is equal. However, the first and second
reviews may provide additional information about what an
average experience (your experience) at the restaurant would
be like. The third and fourth reviews provide less information
because the reviewers’ shared experience makes their
responses statistically dependent on each other. For instance,
if the two reviewers shared an unusually salty dish they are
both likely to write negative reviews and as such, given the
third review, the fourth review provides no new information.
Thus, being aware of this statistical dependence will help
social learners avoid the mistake of placing trust in a group
based on just their number of opinions.
This ability to assess the quality of information being
provided is especially important for young children, who are
learning much about the world from the testimony of others
(e.g., Mills, 2013). Whether young children can use statistical
dependency to evaluate testimony quality is an interesting
question because much of our social learning occurs during
early childhood, when the ability to understand mental states
is still developing (Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001). The
ability to assess quality of information may require a complex
form of “theory of mind” that goes beyond simply copying
the majority. To accurately assess the quality of information,
children must consider not only the testimony each person
gave, but also the unseen information leading to that
testimony, and how that information was gathered.
In addition, one’s own personal experience can also
conflict with what others say, and must be integrated with the
testimony received. Imagine that you have a negative
experience at that restaurant, and are debating whether to go
there again. If there are enough other positive reviews, you
may be willing to disregard your own judgement, and give
the restaurant another chance. Can children evaluate the
quality of their own information relative to a conflicting
majority in a similar manner?

In two experiments, we examined how 4- and 5-year-old
children evaluated their own private information and the
information they received from informants who either shared
a piece of evidence or collected evidence independently.
Specifically, we investigated whether children can
distinguish the quality of information provided by multiple
informants and exhibit a sensitivity to shared data (as
suggested by Hu et al., 2015) or if they merely conform to the
majority (Corriveau, Fusaro, & Harris, 2009). We then
compared children’s performance to that of adults’ on a
similar task (Whalen et al., in press), and the predictions of a
Bayesian rational model to understand the extent to which
children may conform to the majority despite the amount of
information the majority provided.
In Experiment 1, we investigated whether children were
sensitive to evidence being shared by a majority group when
a single dissenter with independent evidence was present. We
found that children were biased towards following a majority
opinion and were not sensitive to statistical dependencies
between informants. In Experiment 2, we highlighted the
source of informants’ knowledge by providing children with
their own private evidence that conflicted with the majority.
We found that given conflicting personal evidence, children
no longer followed the majority and instead sided with their
own evidence regardless of the quality of the majority’s
information. Compared to both adults and to the rational
model, children were not sensitive to dependency, trusting
statistically dependent informants more in Experiment 1, and
placing more weight on their own evidence in Experiment 2.

Background
Previous work by Whalen et al. (in press) demonstrated that
adults are sensitive to statistical dependency between
informants. Participants correctly rated that an option was
more likely when it was endorsed by a majority group with
independent evidence than a group with shared evidence (see
Figure 1(b) for results). Adults also integrated their own
evidence with testimony, appropriately demonstrating no
bias towards their own evidence when it conflicted with the
majority endorsement. In particular, they endorsed the
majority opinion when the group had a higher quality of
information than provided by their own personal evidence.
These findings were consistent with a Bayesian model of
social learning which captures how an idealized learner might
learn from multiple informants with shared information. The
model illustrates that conforming to the majority is rational
when the majority has a greater quality of information
because (like our independent restaurant reviewers) each
member contributed additional independent information.
Thus, although in some cases adults disregard their own
evidence and favour the majority, this may be a product of
rationally integrating the two sources of information and
assessing their quality, and not a bias towards the majority.
In this paper, we investigated whether 4- and 5-year-old
children could assess the information quality provided by a
majority when it conflicted with the information of a minority
or with the child’s own personal evidence. At the age of 4,

children already start to implement strategies in choosing
who to listen to by selectively trusting informants, for
instance by preferring those who are knowledgeable or
accurate (Koenig & Harris, 2005), or experts in the field (e.g.,
Kushnir, Vredenburgh, & Schneider, 2013). However, the
current literature is unclear on whether children value
conformity or information quality during social learning.
Previous studies argued that children value a consensus
even when it conflicts with the child’s own perception. For
instance, children sometimes followed the majority even
when they understood and identified the endorsement of the
majority to be incorrect (Corriveau & Harris, 2010; Haun &
Tomasello, 2011). Using the Asch (1956) paradigm, children
were observed to conform especially when answering in
public in front of their peers (Haun & Tomasello, 2011). At
the age of four, children are already capable of recognizing a
consensus and conforming to them even in ambiguous tasks
such as labelling a novel object (Corriveau et al., 2009).
These findings then suggest that children may have a bias to
conform to a majority, even when the conflicting information
comes from their own perception.
On the other hand, some studies have argued that children
do exhibit the ability to evaluate the quality of information
they receive from multiple informants (Hu et al., 2015). Hu
and colleagues (2015) found that, when given testimony from
two groups, children preferred the group with the highest
quality of knowledge – favouring the group that received
direct knowledge via visual perception over those who
received indirect knowledge via hearsay. However, when
group sizes were not equal, children preferred the group with
the most members, even if the members of the larger group
had only received hearsay.
Additional work has shown that children avoid a
conformity bias if the majority group is proven to be
unsuccessful in reaching an apparent goal (Wilks et al.,
2014), provide implausible functions for a novel object
(Schillaci & Kelemen, 2014), or have lower expertise than
the minority (Burdett et al., 2016). These findings then
suggest that, at least in some cases, children have a preference
for informants with a greater quality of knowledge, rather
than having a preference for the majority per se.
Preschoolers also demonstrate the ability to integrate a
single informant’s testimony with their own observations.
When the two sources conflict, preschoolers acknowledge the
confidence and statistical data provided by an informant to
assess causal relationships of novel toys (Bridgers et al.,
2015), and acknowledge an informant’s awareness for
appearance-reality when considering their own perception as
misleading (Lane et al., 2014). These findings suggest that
children can integrate both sources of information, which
contrasts with previous theoretic models that emphasized
reliance on only social learning (e.g., Rendell, Fogarty, &
Laland, 2010; but see Perreault, Moya, & Boyd, 2012).
Therefore, whether children can appropriately integrate the
quality of informants’ knowledge given a majority and
conflicting information from either a minority or from
personal observation is an open question. However, it is not

2841

always obvious how these different sources of information
should normatively be integrated.

Bayesian Model of Learning from Independent
and Dependent Informants
To further understand how an individual can combine the
information they receive from testimony and personal
evidence, we followed the Bayesian model developed by
Whalen et al. (in press) which captures how an idealized
learner would integrate information provided by groups with
different sources of data – shared or independent – with
personal evidence. In this model, a learner collects personal
evidence about the state of the world, 𝑒, and receives
testimony from 𝑛 informants, 𝑡1 , … , 𝑡𝑛 who collect their own
evidence about the state of the world, 𝑑. Learners evaluate a
potential hypothesis, ℎ, using Bayes’ rule,
𝑝(ℎ|𝑒, 𝑡1 , … , 𝑡𝑛 ) ∝ 𝑝(𝑡1 , … , 𝑡𝑛 |ℎ)𝑝(𝑒|ℎ)𝑝(ℎ),

(1)

where 𝑝(ℎ|𝑒, 𝑡1 , … , 𝑡𝑛 ) is the posterior probability of ℎ, the
probability that a hypothesis about the state of the world is
true given the personal evidence and testimony, while 𝑝(ℎ)
is the prior probability of ℎ, the probability the hypothesis is
true before any evidence is given. Finally, 𝑝(𝑒|ℎ) is the
probability of getting that evidence given the hypothesis, and
𝑝(𝑡1 , … , 𝑡𝑛 |ℎ) is the probability of getting that testimony.
When multiple informants provide independent testimony,
the probability of a series of testimony is equivalent to the
product of the probability of each individual testimony:

evidence, increasing their quality of information (see Figure
1(a) for example predictions based on our experiment task).
In addition, this model accurately predicted the performance
of adults in our experimental task suggesting that adults
integrate both sources of information rationally (see Figure
1(b) for adult performance).
Following the approach of Whalen et al. (in press), we ran
two behavioural experiments that examined how children
evaluated the information they were provided by a majority
group with shared or independent evidence, along with either
a dissenting informant or conflicting private evidence.

Experiment 1: Dissenting Informant
In Experiment 1, children were shown a video about two jars
with differing proportions of red and yellow balls and were
asked to guess which jar was being sampled from, given the
testimony of three friends who received a ball from the
chosen jar. The first two informants endorsed the same jar
and made up the majority group while the third informant
dissented and endorsed the opposing jar. Children were
randomly assigned to either the Shared condition, where the
majority shared one ball, or the Independent condition, where
majority members each received their own ball.
Our model predicts that a rational learner would choose the
jar endorsed by the majority only when each member
collected independent evidence, but be at chance when the
majority shared one piece of evidence, Figure 1(a). On the
other hand, if children have a conformity bias, we should
expect them to pick the majority’s jar in both conditions.

were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: The
Independent condition (n = 14) or the Shared condition (n =
15). An additional 6 children were excluded due to atypical
development (1), provided ambiguous answers (1), did not
provide an answer (2), or experimenter error (2).

Procedure In this experiment, children were shown a video
on a laptop, where an experimenter introduced two jars
comprised of coloured balls – one with mostly yellow balls,
a few red balls, and one green ball and one with mostly red
balls, a few yellow balls, and one white ball, and introduced
her three adult friends. The experimenter explained that she
would pour just one of the two jars into her bag and give each
of her friends a ball from the bag. Each of her friends would
then tell her which of the two jars they thought she picked.
Once the experimenter filled the bag with one of the two
jars, she used a cup to randomly scoop a ball from the bag to
hand to each of her friends. After looking inside the cup, the
informants provided testimony as to which jar they thought
the bag was filled from, either the jar with mostly red or
mostly yellow balls in it. The first two informants always
endorsed the same jar and made up the majority group, while
the last informant always chose the opposite jar. The jar

endorsed by the majority and the actor playing the minority
informant were counterbalanced.
In the Independent condition, informants were in the room
one at a time and were each given their own randomly
sampled ball to view. Each informant stated, for instance, “I
looked at the ball and I think that the bag has mostly red balls
in it.” In the Shared condition, all three informants were
present in the room and the first two informants shared a
single randomly sampled ball. After providing a testimony,
the first informant was asked to pass the same cup to the
second informant who then agreed with the first, e.g. “I
looked at the ball and thought about what my friend said. I
agree with Jessie. I think that the bag has mostly red balls in
it.” While the third informant received a different random ball
and disagreed with the rest, e.g. “I looked at the ball and
thought about what my friends said. I disagree with Jessie and
Sarah. I think that the bag has mostly yellow balls in it.”
Once the video was completed, the on-site experimenter, a
different person than the one in the video, reminded the child
which jar each informant endorsed and if they saw the same
or a different ball as the previous informant, and that all the
balls came from just one jar. Finally, she asked a forcedchoice question of which jar the child thought the bag was
filled from, either the jar with mostly red or yellow balls in it.
The order in which the jars were stated was randomized.

children appeared to place more weight on the statistically
dependent testimony in the Shared condition.

Discussion
Unlike our model predictions and adults’ performance,
children were not able to appropriately evaluate the quality of
information in an informant’s testimony. When two
informants received the same ball and gave the same
testimony, children over-weighed the majority’s shared
information relative to the dissenter’s independent
information. These results support previous findings by
Corriveau et al. (2009) who found that children conform to a
majority when faced with an ambiguous decision.
Based on the results of Experiment 1, we wanted to identify
ways to help children avoid relying on the majority and
instead, evaluate which group has the greater quality of
information. To do this, we highlighted the independent
nature of the minority information by having the child receive
private evidence that conflicted with the majority testimony
which mimicked many real-world scenarios where our own
private experience conflicts with testimony. If the child then
has to integrate social learning with personal observation, this
may help identify the source of knowledge each individual
has and overcome a conformity bias.

Experiment 2: Own Ball

Results
Each child was given a score of 0 or 1, with 1 as agreeing
with the majority and 0 as disagreeing. Results are shown in
Figure 1(c). Overall, children chose the jar endorsed by the
majority significantly more often than chance, regardless of
how the members of the majority collected their information
(binomial test, 21 out of 29 endorsed the majority, p = 0.024).
We analyzed the differences between the conditions using
a Fisher’s exact test. The difference between the Independent
and Shared condition was not significant (10 out of 14
endorsed the majority in the Independent condition, 11 out of
15 in the Shared condition, p = 1). Children chose the
majority’s jar equally often when the majority had higher
quality independent information and lower quality shared
information. Finally, compared to adults and to our model,

In Experiment 1, children were making a decision based on
testimony alone. However, in most real-world cases, we take
in the information that others provide us and evaluate it with
our own information. Therefore, in Experiment 2, children no
longer saw a minority group, and instead were given their
own ball from the bag that conflicted with the testimony. For
example, if the informants all endorsed the jar with mostly
red balls, the child received a yellow ball from the bag.
As predicted by the Bayesian model, children should
choose the jar endorsed by the majority when the members
independently collected data and have more information than
provided by the child’s own single piece of evidence. If,
however, the members of the majority shared a single piece
of evidence, children should endorse the majority at chance,
as the child’s own evidence would be as reliable as the

2843

majority’s. Similar to Experiment 1, if children present a
conformity bias, they will follow the majority regardless of
the quality of information provided by the group.

Methods
Participants A total of 52 preschoolers (female = 24, male =
28; mean age = 4 years 11 months; range = 48 – 71 months)
were recruited through local museums and daycares, or in lab.
They were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: The
Independent condition (n = 26) or the Shared condition (n =
26). An additional 14 children were excluded due to
experimenter error (10), previous participation in Experiment
1 (1), inattentiveness (1) and ambiguous answers (2).
Procedure Experiment 2 had the same jars and actors, and
similar sampling procedures. However, all three informants
endorsed the same jar and made up the majority group for
both conditions. As in Experiment 1, children were randomly
assigned to either the Independent or Shared condition.
In the Independent condition, each informant received their
own distinct randomly sampled ball and provided their
testimony in the room one at a time. In the Shared condition,
all three informants were present in the room and shared a
single randomly sampled ball and provided testimony
agreeing with the previous informants.
After the video ended, the on-site experimenter reminded
the child which informant endorsed which jar, if they looked
at the same or different ball as the previous informants, and
that all the balls came from just one jar. In this experiment,
all the informants endorsed only one jar. Next, the on-site
experimenter brought out an identical bag and stated that it
was the same bag from the video containing the same balls.
Similar to the experimenter in the video, she used a plastic
cup to give the child their own ball from the bag. The on-site
experimenter pretended to scoop up a ball at random, but in
fact the child always received a ball that was a different
colour from the majority testimony. After the child looked
inside the cup, the on-site experimenter asked which jar they
thought all the balls came from, as in Experiment 1.

Results
Results are shown in Figure 1(c). Overall, children chose the
jar endorsed by the informants below chance regardless of
how the informants collected their information (binomial test,
11 out of 52 endorsed the majority, p < 0.001). Similar to
Experiment 1, we found that children did not choose the
informant’s jar more in the Independent condition compared
to the Shared condition (5 out of 26 endorsed the majority in
the Independent condition, 6 out of 26 in the Shared
condition, p = 1, Fisher’s exact test). In both conditions,
children weighed their own evidence more, compared to both
adults and the predictions of the Bayesian model.

Discussion
We found that in Experiment 2, children relied heavily on
their own evidence and chose the jar consistent with their
own ball regardless of whether the majority collected

independent or shared evidence. As in Experiment 1, we
found no significant difference between the Independent and
Shared conditions, suggesting that children were not
sensitive to the statistical dependency. These results support
previous findings suggesting that children may rely on their
own evidence that they personally collected over the
evidence collected by others (Kushnir & Gopnik, 2005;
Kushnir, Wellman, & Gelman, 2009).

General Discussion
We investigated how children weighed the value of
information they received from multiple individuals and their
own personal evidence. We compared the performance of 4and 5-year-old children to the performance of adults on a
similar task (Whalen et al. in press) and to the predictions of
a Bayesian rational model. Experiment 1 showed that
children were not sensitive to the shared information of a
group and were instead following the majority. Experiment 2
demonstrated that children would no longer use the strategy
of conforming to the majority if they themselves collected
conflicting evidence and instead, relied on their own
evidence, regardless of the quality of the majority’s
information. Therefore, compared to adults, children applied
a different strategy in the integration of information.
Children’s apparent conformity bias is consistent with
previous findings that argued that children prefer to rely on
the majority (e.g., Corriveau et al., 2009; Haun, Rekers, &
Tomasello, 2012; Haun & Tomasello, 2011). Children may
exhibit this reliance on the majority because it is often a
useful and reliable social learning strategy (Haun et al.,
2014). After all, the majority made their choices for a reason.
However, in the presence of children’s own conflicting
evidence, a conformity bias was no longer present. Although
previous work has suggested that children may present a
conformity bias even in the face of conflicting direct
perception (Corriveau & Harris, 2010; Haun & Tomasello,
2011), it is important to note that in those studies, a majority
of children still favoured their own evidence over the
testimony of the majority.
This bias to rely on personal evidence over the evidence
collected by others has previously been observed in the causal
domain as a self-agency bias, especially when the evidence
seemed to be ambiguous or probabilistic (Kushnir et al.,
2009). Kushnir and Gopnik (2005) discovered that children
would weigh their own causal interventions more heavily
than the causal interventions of others. They suggested that
children had this bias because they viewed their own actions
to be more controlled and reliable and less likely to be
confounded than those of other individuals. However, this
bias to one’s own evidence has not yet been observed in a
non-causal domain like that of our current study. Similarly,
children in our study might have considered their direct
perception of their own ball to be more reliable than the
information they received from the informants’ testimony.
One possible explanation for the presence of both a bias
towards conformity and towards personal evidence in this
task is that preschoolers learning how to integrate

2844

information have yet to develop more complex aspects of
theory of mind (e.g., Gweon et al., 2012). At this age,
children might have had difficulty reasoning about how the
informants generated their testimony based on the evidence
that they likely received. In other words, 4- and 5-year-old
children know that people can have beliefs, but may have
difficulty in knowing how these people came to believe
something. As a consequence, children might rely on the
number of endorsements given rather than on their quality,
leading to the appearance of a conformity bias. On the other
hand, children were likely confident in what they themselves
saw which appeared as a bias towards their own evidence.
Future work should investigate whether children have
difficulty inferring the evidence informants likely received
based on their testimony, by testing how children respond
when they can observe this evidence directly, for instance by
presenting it in clear cups. We expect that children would
then compare the amount of evidence between the majority
and minority group rather than the number of endorsements.
If children can identify the statistical dependency when the
evidence is visible, they should no longer demonstrate a
conformity or a personal evidence bias.
In addition, in ongoing follow-up studies, the child’s
evidence is presented on-screen within the video rather than
performed live to equate saliency. If children still present a
bias towards their own evidence, the salience from a live
performance as a reason for this bias can be ruled out.
Taken together, our findings suggest that children
implement a different social learning mechanism than adults
and our Bayesian model. When integrating testimony alone,
children over-weighed the quality of information provided by
the majority. On the other hand, when the child was given
their own conflicting evidence, children under-weighed the
quality of information provided by the majority and relied on
their own perception. Thus, unlike adults, children require
further development in their social learning and perhaps their
reasoning of mental states to avoid biases and become
sensitive to statistical dependency.
