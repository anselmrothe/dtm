Some readers may find it easy to consider that analogies act
as a kind of theory whose truth can be supported or refuted
by evidence. Indeed, some philosophical investigations have
proposed statistical bases for analogical rationality (Harrod,
1956; Mill, 1882), and a recent study has found that people
are sensitive to these rational statistics (Rogers & Landy,
2016). But this epistemological view of analogy has not

Statistical Analysis & Results
We analyzed the participant responses by regressing each

statements with each condition coded as a dummy variable.
Since the assumptions violated linearity, we used

significance. For comparison, we also calculated Cohen’s d
