                    Example scenarios
We illustrate several potential scenarios of using our method
to visualise mouse tracking data by applying it to the pre-
viously obtained experimental data on a simple learning
task (O’Hora et al., 2013). The task consisted of a series of
binary choices between abstract symbols, with each symbol
yielding either low or high reward (e.g., 5 or 20 points). The
goal of the participants was to get as many points as possible
throughout a set of 36 trials, which included low vs. low, high
vs. low, and high vs. high choices. By the end of the experi-
ment, most of the participants successfully learned to choose
only the symbols associated with high reward.
   Here we only consider part of the dataset corresponding
to high vs. low choices, so that there is always a “correct”
choice. The data are preprocessed so that the correct (“high”)
option is mapped to right-hand corner of the screen, and in-
correct option is located in the left-hand corner. To fit the ex-
perimental data, we used the version of the model with α = 4,
which has seven free parameters. The baseline values of the
parameters were set to τ = 0.05, ci j = 0.
   Fig. 4 shows the example decision landscapes obtained for
three trajectories generated by Participant 444. The shape
of the fitted landscape changes depending on the dynamics
