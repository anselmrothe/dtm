Procedure
Participants were presented with letter strings and were
asked to indicate whether the string constituted a real
English word by pressing either â€˜zâ€™ or â€˜mâ€™ on a standard
QWERTY keyboard; key mapping was systematically
varied so that half of all participants used â€˜zâ€™ to indicate a
word and â€˜mâ€™ to indicate a non-word whilst half responded
with â€˜mâ€™ for words and â€˜zâ€™ for non-words. Strings were
presented for a maximum of 1500ms and were immediately
preceded by a 75ms prime. All prime-target pairs mapped
exactly onto bigrams from the stimuli lists whereby the first
word of the bigram acted as a prime and the second word as
the target. A fixation point was presented in the centre of the
screen for 500ms prior to each trial. Prime-Target pairs were
presented in two blocks each containing fifteen low-
frequency bigrams, fifteen high-frequency bigrams, fifteen                Figure 1: Non-transformed group means for bigram

                     Experiment Two
Design
Experiment two used a LDT to assess the extent to which
bigram diversity affects word recognition. The aim of the
experiment was to identify any statistical priming effect that
may result from the predictability of the second word in a
bigram given the diversity of the first.
Materials
Stimuli were obtained and processed using an identical
procedure to experiment one with the exception that the
word lists were organised according to high (>100 potential
followers) or low (<2 potential followers) diversity or
bigrams consisting of primes that do not have followers
within the BNC. Word lists were balanced in the same way
as the first experiment, each p >0.06 with the exception that
the low diversity list differed significantly from both the
high and no diversity list on concreteness (high: p <0.01, no:
p <0.01); this is due to the relative scarcity of low diversity
bigrams within the BNC and the theoretical decision to
prioritise controlling individual word frequency since this
