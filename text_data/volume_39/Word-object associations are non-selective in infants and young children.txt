Abstract
For decades, theories of early word learning have assumed
that infants are equipped with learning biases that help them
learn words at a fast pace. One of these biases, called Mutual
Exclusivity, suggests that infants reject second labels for
name-known objects. Our first two experiments, with children
and with infants, suggest that novelty preference during
Mutual Exclusivity tasks should not be taken as evidence that
associations between novel labels and name-known objects
have not taken place. A third experiment, supplemented with
computational modeling, ruled out cascaded activation
patterns as alternative explanations and, instead, confirmed
that word-object associations are non-selective throughout
infancy and childhood.

Introduction
Children learn words at a fascinating pace (Bloom, 2000).
Researchers have suggested that infants are equipped with
language learning biases that help them learn words
efficiently (Markman, 1990). One such word learning bias,
called Mutual Exclusivity (ME; Markman & Wachtel,
1988), suggests that each object has only one label.
Markman and Wachtel (1988) found that children selected a
novel object significantly more than a name-known object
when hearing a novel label. The associations formed
between novel labels and novel objects through ME have
been shown to be retained, as Mather and Plunkett (2011)
found that children were able to match novel labels with the
matching novel objects they were exposed to during a
learning phase. This provided evidence that ME can indeed
be used to learn words. Yet, it did not address the question
of whether infants reject additional labels for name-known
objects or not.
In parallel, Smith and Yu (2008) found that when only
name-unknown objects are present, infants retain multiple
associations between labels and objects. According to their
cross-situational statistical learning account (CSL), different
word-object associations are being retained and their
strengths evolve along with the presentation of labels and
objects. Ultimately, a hierarchy of word-object associations
is established through the differing numbers of cooccurrences between words and objects. The strongest
word-object associations can be seen as providing a basis

towards establishing robust patterns of word learning. This
framework suggests that, contrary to ME, children are
capable of forming more than one association between
objects and words.
Further evidence brought a nuanced view to strict ME
accounts. Learners were found to be able to overcome ME
and performed above chance when forming two-to-one
mappings in CSL-type experiments (Yurovsky and Yu,
2008). Kachergis, Yu and Shiffrin (2009) and Poepsel and
Weiss (2014) found that although children performed better
in one-to-one mapping, they readily violated ME if there
was strong evidence that a new mapping was required.
Yet, Trueswell, Medina, Hafri, Gleitman (2013) found
that children do not store all word-object associations.
Instead, they make an initial guess and evaluate the validity
of this guess in subsequent trials. If the guess is proven to be
correct, then the association is strengthened. Otherwise,
children will make another guess while discarding
previously-made associations. This strategy was coined as a
Propose-but-Verify hypothesis (PbV). In a more recent
study, Stevens, Gleitman, Trueswell, and Yang (2016)
refined their PbV hypothesis, and suggest that children store
previous associations as references for future trials.
In our present contribution, we ask whether infants and
young children accept second labels for name-known
objects. To this end, we adapted a classic ME task, in which
novel labels are being uttered while a name-known object
and a novel object are being displayed. Strict ME accounts
would suggest that children will map novel labels to novel
objects, and that they will reject the formation of an
association between novel labels and name-known objects.
In our adaptation, the learning phase featured two sets of
ME training trials: in each set a novel label was uttered in
the presence of a name-known object and of a novel object.
During the testing phase, both novel objects used during
training were shown together. If children were able to retain
the associations learned during ME practice, they would be
able to map each novel label to the matching novel object.
This testing phase was aimed at verifying that ME can
indeed be used to learn words, thus replicating Mather and
Plunkett (2011). In another testing block, the two nameknown objects used during ME were shown together, while
playing one of the novel labels used during training.
According to a strict interpretation of ME, children should
not display preference for either objects, since they should

3161

have inhibited the formation of an association from the
novel word to the name-known objects. In contrast, if
children displayed a preference for the name-known object
of the matching set, this would suggest that infants do not
reject additional labels for name-known objects, and that
they are non-selective when forming word-object
associations. In other words, children would map the novel
word with all objects present in the scene.
Thereafter, we will present three experiments aiming at
refining our understanding of the formation of early wordobject associations.

Experiment 1
Methods
Participants 174 children were recruited in Nottingham
(UK) from which only data from English monolinguals (N =
148) was analysed, as bilinguals are expected to differ from
monolinguals in ME-related tasks (e.g., Byers-Heinlein &
Werker, 2009; Davidson & Tell, 2005; Houston-Price,
Caloghiris, & Raviglione, 2010). The participants’ age
ranged from 4 years to 12 years (M = 7.36 years, SD =
2.06). Among them, 65 were male and 83 were female.
Stimuli The visual stimuli (pictures of 640 x 480 pixel)
were obtained from Frank, Sugarman, Horowitz, Lewis, &
Yurovsky (2016). The novel labels were “dax” and “modi”
and both novel words and familiar words were embedded in
the carrier sentence “Find the __!”. Auditory labels were
recorded by a female native English-speaker in an infantdirected manner.
Procedure The experiment was carried out on an iPad. The
participants had to first complete a warm-up task, where
they were instructed to tap on five dots appearing in random
places, followed by five smiley faces presented on the
screen of the iPad. After the warm-up task, the experiment
was started. There were three experimental blocks, namely a
Mutual Exclusivity (ME) training, a Word Learning test and
a Selectivity test (see Figure 1).

Image pairs

In ME training, two sets of stimuli were used. Each of the
sets consisted of one pair of images, one name-known
image and one novel image, along with a novel label (“dax”
and “carrot” for the first set, “modi” and “cat” for the other
set). In each ME trial, one pair of images was displayed
while the novel label was being played (embedded in the
carrier sentence "find the __!"). We defined the target to be
the novel object. Participants had the opportunity to learn
two novel labels for the two novel images via ME. Each pair
was repeated four times.
In the Word Learning test, both novel images (the
“targets” in ME training) were displayed side-by-side while
one of the corresponding novel labels used during training
was played. These trials were repeated four times, such that
both novel labels were uttered twice. The aim was to test
whether the participant had formed an association between a
novel label and the corresponding novel image; a
prerequisite for word learning.
In the Selectivity test, the two name-known images (the
“distractors” in ME training) were displayed side-by-side
while one of the novel labels used for training was played.
Target selection (i.e., tapping on the name-known image
from the matching set) would provide evidence that an
association between the name-known image and a second
label was not inhibited during ME training. This block also
consisted of four trials. The order of presentation of the
Word Learning test block and the Selectivity test block was
randomised across participants.

Results and Discussion of Experiment 1
As children were required to select an image out of two
presented to them, binomial tests were run to measure the
proportion of accurate responses as compared to chance
(.50) in the different blocks. The proportion of accurate
responses for the different blocks may be seen in Table 1.

The results obtained provided evidence for the occurrence
of ME during training, where the children selected the novel
image upon hearing a novel word, thus replicating classical
ME results (e.g., Golinkoff, Hirsh-Pasek, Bailey, & Wenger,
1992; Mather & Plunkett, 2011).
Children also performed above chance in the Word
Learning test, indicating that they were able to form an
association between the novel images and the novel words.
This also replicates previous studies (e.g., Mather &
Plunkett, 2011; Mervis & Bertrand, 1994;), which suggest
that ME can indeed be used to learn words.

3162

Crucially, it was also found that children were able to
form associations between novel words and name-known
objects, suggesting that word-object associations are nonselective.
Age was not found to correlate significantly in the
Selectivity test (r = .113, p = .171), suggesting that younger
infants going through a rapid expansion in their vocabulary
may also be able to associate novel labels to name-known
objects.

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 aimed at establishing whether infants are also
non-selective when forming word-object associations. The
design of Experiment 2 was similar to the previous
experiment, with the main difference that infants were tested
using an eye-tracker.

Methods
Participants Forty-three 21-month-old infants (M = 21.01,
SD = 0.57) participated in the experiment (25 boys). Nine
additional children were tested but excluded because of
fussiness (4), failed calibration (4) or software problem (1).
All participants were French native speakers recruited in the
canton of Geneva, Switzerland.
Stimuli Four novel labels were created for the experiment:
“pogalle”, “pizelle”, “nidoupe” and “loutade”. The novel
labels were all defined to be of feminine gender, so that no
disambiguation could be applied before the onset of the
word itself. In addition to the novel labels, eight familiar
words were used throughout the experiment. All words were
embedded in the sentence “Regarde la __!” (Look at the
__!). All auditory stimuli were recorded by an enthusiastic
French native speaker of Switzerland in a child-directed
manner. Visual stimuli were photographs of objects on a
light grey background which were extracted from the
NOUN database (Horst & Hout, 2016).
Procedure The procedure of Experiment 2 was similar to
Experiment 1 with the exception of two changes, listed
thereafter. First, Experiment 2 was conducted with an eyetracker. Thus, looking preference was analysed as opposed
to target selection in Experiment 1. Second, another set of
images and labels was used.
Infants sat on their caregiver's laps, in front of a
flatscreen, approximately 70cm from the screen. An SMI
RED500 eye-tracker recorded infants’ fixations at a
sampling rate of 500 Hz. The experiment started with a 5point calibration and validation sequence. Upon successful
calibration, the experiment started. The calibration
procedure was repeated for infants who failed to go through
all 5 points or if the validation revealed substantial
deviations.
Analysis method Due to data loss in eye-tracking studies,
measures typically used in intermodal preferential looking
(IPL) paradigms, Preferential Target Looking (PTL) and
Longest Look (LL) measures are not appropriate (Wass,

Forssman, & Leppänen, 2014). A novel analysis was thus
introduced similar to the one described by Maris and
Oostenveld (2007). The approach is of the model-fitting
type, whereby one does not merely compute the maximum
likelihood estimates for a set of parameters; the models can
also be tested whether or not they are significantly different
from each other. The likelihood ratio test then provides the
means for comparing the likelihood of the data under the
hypothesis that infants are biased towards the target, against
the likelihood of the data under the more restricted
hypothesis (or null hypothesis) that infants do not have a
preference for either the target or the distractor.
A binomial analysis is performed for every time step of
every test trial in the post-naming phase, from 367ms after
the onset of the target word (accounting for the time it takes
infants to fixate the target object, see Swingley & Aslin,
2000) for 1500ms. For each time step the number of infants
looking at the target is counted, as well as the number of
infants looking at the distractor. The binomial test can
reveal if an excess of infants looking at either the distractor
or the target at that moment is likely to result from a biased
looking behavior (e.g., that infants tend to look more at the
target) or if an observed imbalance in the number of infants
looking to the target and the distractor can be attributed to
mere random variations or noise.

Results and Discussion of Experiment 2
Results Figure 2 depicts the looking preference of the 21month-old infants when they were presented during the test
phase with the two novel objects used during training (in
black) and the two name-known objects used during training
(in red). Vertical bars indicate the time steps for which an
individual binomial test rejects the hypothesis that infants
are not biased towards any object. In both test situations,
hypotheses were rejected in favor of a bias towards the
target.
Infants display a preference for the target and the loglikelihood that each point belongs to the distribution of
unbiased simulated infants can be computed, as it
corresponds to the negative square of the Mahalanobis
distance (Mahalanobis, 1936). The log-likelihood L that the
21-month infants is unbiased equals L = 1.891 for the Word
Learning test and L = -44.765 for the Selectivity test. The
statistical relevance of this hypothesis can only be made
from the comparison to another model; the biased model.
Log-likelihoods that the 21-month-olds belong to the
distribution of simulated infants can be computed for each
different bias, and one can estimate the maximum loglikelihood estimate, associated with the optimal bias; e.g.,
that accounts best for the data.
The maximum log-likelihood equals L = -0.010 for a bias
towards the target when both novel objects are used during
the Word Learning test and equals L = -0.003 for a bias
towards the target for selectivity test.
Finally, the likelihood ratio test is applied. In the Word
Learning test, the 21-month-old infants approach
significance (p = .053). On the Selectivity test, the

3163

likelihood ration test shows that infants are significantly
biased towards the target (p < .001). In other words, they
have formed a second association between a novel label and
a name-known object; 21-month-old infants also seem to be
non-selective when forming word-object associations.

Stimuli Visual stimuli were obtained from the same source
as Experiment 1. The novel labels used were “pifo” and
“dofa” paired with images of a ball and a cup, respectively.
Procedure The procedure was the same as Experiment 1
except for the sequence of the tasks. In Experiment 3, there
were four blocks, namely the ME training, the Selectivity
test, the new Encyclopaedic test and the Word Learning test.
There were four trials in both the Selectivity test and the
Encyclopaedic test but only two trials in Word Learning
test. The order of the Selectivity test and the Encyclopaedic
test was counterbalanced whereas the Word Learning test
was always administered at the end of the experiment.
In the Encyclopaedic test, novel images used during ME
training were displayed side-by-side while the names of the
corresponding familiar images were played (see Fig. 3).

Experiment 3
In Experiment 1 and 2, children were found to be able to
form associations between novel labels and name-known
images. Yet, one cannot rule out that infants have formed an
encyclopaedic mapping; i.e., they rely on the co-occurrence
between the novel object and the name-known object to
form an association between both objects. In turn, they may
exploit this object-object association to select the nameknown object when hearing the novel label, through
cascaded activation from the novel label to novel object
(through ME) and from the novel object to the familiar
object (through the encyclopaedic mapping). To test if the
association between the novel word and the name-known
object is lexical or encyclopaedic, a new test, referred to as
the Encyclopaedic test, was created. In this test, both novel
images used during training were presented side-by-side,
but the labels of the name-known distractors were played
instead (see Figure 3). As the novel images were never
displayed in the presence of these familiar labels, we would
expect children’s performance to be at chance level.

Methods
Participants 150 children were recruited at The University
of Nottingham. Only data from the 124 English
monolingual children (55 male, 69 female) was retained for
analysis. Children were 3 to 12 years of age (M = 7.31
years, SD = 2.28).

Results and Discussion of Experiment 3
Binomial tests were run to measure the proportion of
accurate responses as compared to chance (.50) in the
different blocks. The results once more supported the
presence of ME during training (all p’s < .001) and that
word-object associations are retained in the Word Learning
test (all p’s < .001).
However, and contrary to our hypothesis, children
selected the target in the Encyclopaedic test (significantly
above chance for “cup” (p = .001), and approaching
significance for “ball”, p = .063), suggesting that infants
formed an encyclopaedic mapping between all items, rather
than forming multiple associations at a lexical level between
a name-known object and multiple labels. The only
explanation is that children display evidence of cascaded
activation, from the familiar name to the corresponding
name-known object, and through the novel object it was
paired with.
Does cascaded activation also explain results concerning
the Selectivity test? Maybe children are strictly following
ME; upon hearing the novel label, they activate the
representation of the matching novel object (learned during
ME) and select the name-known object that co-occurred
with the novel object? How can we distinguish between the
cascading and the non-selectivity explanations?
Let us look at correlations between the different
experimental blocks. A strict ME account would suggest
that lexical associations can only be formed between the
novel label and the novel object during ME training. A

3164

stronger ME effect would translate into stronger
associations between novel labels and novel objects.
Through cascaded activation, novel label to novel object
(ME) and from novel object to familiar object (through an
encyclopaedic mapping), a strict ME account would suggest
a positive correlation between performances in the ME
training phase and performance in the Selectivity test.
In contrast, the hypothesis that word-object associations
are non-selective (following the arguments of CSL) would
predict that the novel label would also be associated with
the name-known object. Accordingly, higher accuracy in the
ME training block would suggest that children should spend
more time on the novel object than at the name-known
object, in turn leading to the formation of stronger
associations between novel labels and novel objects but
weaker associations between novel labels and name-known
objects. Thus, if the associations between novel words and
novel objects are non-selective, and that such associations
take place at a lexical level, the accuracy score in ME
training should correlate negatively with the accuracy score
in the Selectivity test.
In our data, the accuracy score of ME training correlated
positively with the Word Learning test (r = .232, p = .009),
while correlations between ME and the Encyclopaedic test
were not significant (r = -.075, p = .406), thus far consistent
with both explanations. However, ME training results
correlated negatively with performance during the
Selectivity test (r = -.218, p = .015). The experimental
results support the hypothesis that word-object associations
are non-selective, and that the formation of association
between novel labels and name-known objects take place at
a lexical level. Next, we further scrutinise the above
reasoning by constructing two simple computational models
of Experiment 3.

hypothesis, and had a mean novelty-preference of 0.8, and
Gaussian random variations of a standard deviation of 0.05.
In the strict ME model, associations between novel labels
and name-known objects were inhibited whereas in the nonselective model, such associations were permitted.
Correlations between preference for the novel object during
ME training and preference for the target object in each test
block were computed.
As predicted, modelling results showed that a strict ME
account sustains positive correlations between ME training
and the Word Learning test (r = .89, p < .001) and between
ME and the Selectivity test (r = .68, p < .001). In contrast,
the non-selective model displays a positive correlation
between ME training and the Word Learning test (r = .89, p
< .001) but a negative correlation between ME and the
Selectivity test (r = -.33, p < .001). The modelling results,
along with the empirical results, provide additional evidence
that children are non-selective when forming word-object
associations.

General Discussion

Computational Models of Experiment 3
Two models were constructed, in order to compare a strict
ME account with a non-selective account of the CSL type.
In both models, associations are modulated based on cooccurrence of items presented simultaneously; between
objects and labels, as well as between both objects. In each
trial, previous association strengths define relative looking
time towards each object via the application of Luce’s
forced choice rule (with a separation parameter of k=8).
Looking time, in turn, modulate the magnitude of the
association strength update, in a Hebb-like update rule (with
a learning rate of 0.1). The associations between both
objects are obtained by computing the product of the
relative preference associated with each object. Similarly,
indirect associations such as cascaded activation from the
novel label to the novel object and the familiar object are
computed through the product of the association strength
between the novel label and the novel object and the
association strength between the novel object and the
familiar object.
The order of stimuli was identical in the model and for
participants. 100 individual models were created for each

While Mutual Exclusivity assumes that children associate
only one word to one object, Cross-situation Statistical
Learning accounts suggest that children maintain a
hierarchy of word-object pairings established on the basis of
co-occurrence of object and labels. These two theories have
typically been tested using different experimental designs;
while ME studies generally feature both novel and familiar
objects, CSL studies typically present only novel objects.
Our approach aims at testing both theories by using a
Selectivity test, so as to examine whether children accept
additional associations between a name-known object and a
novel label.
In all three studies, we found that children tend to map the
novel label to the novel object, replicating classic ME
experiments, that infants tend to look at (or select) novel
objects upon hearing a novel word.
We also replicated findings that associations between
novel objects and novel labels are momentarily retained,
thus providing a necessary basis towards the consolidation
of word-object associations, and towards word learning
(e.g., see Mather & Plunkett, 2011).
Yet, we argue that evidence of ME – a preference for a
novel object when hearing a novel label – should not be
taken as proof that associations between novel labels and
name-known objects are suppressed. Experiment 1, with
school-aged children, and Experiment 2, with 21-month-old
infants, provided converging evidence that word-object
associations are non-selective: children may well display
evidence of ME during training, but they also show
evidence that associations between novel labels and nameknown objects are maintained during test blocks, and not
inhibited as suggested by strict ME accounts.
Experiment 3 aimed at ruling out alternative explanations
for the results observed in the first two studies. The
introduction of an additional test block, the Encyclopaedic
test, suggested that children displayed cascaded activation

3165

patterns. Yet, correlation analyses between the ME training
phase and the different test blocks suggested that the pattern
of results can be best explained if children are non-selective
when forming word-object associations. Strict ME accounts
would predict a positive correlation between ME training
and selectivity test as children have to rely on cascaded
activation to identify the target. In contrast, non-selective
learning accounts would suggest that children displaying
stronger novelty preference during ME training would
display weaker associations between the novel label and the
name-known object, thus leading to a negative correlation
between ME training and the Selectivity test. The latter
pattern of results was observed experimentally.
The finding that infants are non-selective in their
formation of word-object associations sits well with other
recent findings that infants are flexible in their interpretation
of the meaning of novel words (Ramscar, Dye, & Klein,
2013) and that infants engage into cross-situational
statistical learning with (multiple) objects in their visual
field (Yu & Smith, 2011; Yurovsky, Smith, & Yu, 2013).
The very first stages of word learning taking place during
ambiguous naming situations, such as in ME experiments or
cross-situational statistical learning situations, do seem to be
principled by low-level associationist mechanisms whereby
multiple word-object pairings are being built. The hierarchy
of word-object associations can then evolve across
situations so that ultimately only relevant word-object
mappings are retained. In sum, infants and children appear
to be flexible when learning words and readily entertain the
possibility that objects can have multiple names.
