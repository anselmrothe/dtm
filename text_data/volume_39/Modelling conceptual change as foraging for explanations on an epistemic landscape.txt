representing observations of the brightness of a single light

describes (formally) the task and how it was sequenced and
how students progressed from context to I to III. In what fol-

no detailed way to derive the epistemic landscape from the
graph as described in Fig. 1 and the connection remains a
qualitative one. With these restrictions, however, the epis-
temic landscape can be constructed by using utility functions
uk (ε, κ), which describe the epistemic utility of schemes mk .
The detailed forms of the functions are, fortunately, not im-
portant here; it is enough that they can serve to describe the
assumed generic features of the tiered system. Therefore, the
mathematical description of the epistemic landscape adopted
here is based on a set of suitably flexible functions. Con-
venient mathematical forms that are easy to use in simula-
tions because the cumulative probability finction is invert-
ible are provided by MinMax-distributions (Kumaraswamy-
distributions) (Jones, 2009) as given in Table 1. The epis-
temic landscape thus consists of five manifolds of which Fig.
2 show the schemes with the greatest utility in a given region.

landscape. The normalization factors N1 -N5 are defined so
that maximum value of each utility function is 1. The func-
