                             Results
   Control condition In the control condition with no story,
both children and adults looked at chance to the DCR (p
>.05), and above chance to the SCR (children: t(27) =5.61, p
= .001, adults: t(29)=4.64, p = .001), as expected (Figure 2).
   Constraining verb trials Recall that the displays
contained two distractor objects in addition to the DCR and
SCR. We first ascertained whether participants looked
preferentially to the DCR and SCR. Both adults and
children did so at a rate significantly above chance
(children: t(31)=8.1, p = .001; adults: t(33)= 7.82, p = .001).
A one-way ANOVA demonstrated that adults’ and
children’s looking behaviour was similar (F(1,65) = .00, p
>.05.) Thus, both children and adults discounted distractors
from their interpretation of the unfolding sentence following
verb onset, as seen in Figure 3.
   In order to discover how hearing a constraining verb
influenced children’s and adults’ anticipatory processing,
we then examined the proportion of time that participants
spent looking to the DCR and SCR before and after verb
onset. Since constraining and neutral verb trials were
identically structured prior to verb onset, we collapsed
looking time in the pre-verb window across trial types
(constraining and neutral) for this analysis. Paired t-tests
demonstrated that upon hearing a constraining verb, the
proportion of both children’s and adults’ looking time to the
semantically congruent referent rose relative to its pre-verb
baseline (children: t(31)=-3.54, p = .005); adults: t(32) =-
