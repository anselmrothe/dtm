Abstract

extensive experience leads to more efficient visual
processing of complex shapes. In other words, whereas for
naïve observers, complex letter-shapes are more difficult to
discriminate than are simple ones, for expert observers the
reverse is true. This effect was referred to as the
“complexity benefit”. As a first step to furthering our
understanding of the complexity benefit, the current study
seeks to determine (a) whether the complexity effect is
specific to Arabic, and (b) whether the magnitude of the
effect is related to the amount of experience with a specific
script or if extends across scripts.

Previous work has demonstrated that the visual complexity of
letter-shapes is processed differently by naïve and expert
observers. Specifically, fluent readers of the Arabic alphabet
were found to discriminate complex letters more readily than
less complex letters, whereas naïve observers exhibited the
opposite effect. This “complexity benefit”, wherein complex
letters confer a processing advantage to expert observers, is
not yet well understood. In a new study, we investigate
whether this effect generalizes across scripts, and whether it
is unique to individuals with biscriptal experience (knowledge
of reading two different scripts). The results of the three
experiments confirm that the complexity benefit is
characteristic of expert monoscriptal and biscriptal readers,
and that, furthermore, there may be a biscriptal advantage in
processing visual complexity.

The Current Study
Whereas Wiley, Wilson, & Rapp (2016) focused only on
comparing the effects in letter perception of the amount of
expertise (naïve or expert observers), it is also the case that
those participants can be divided along another dimension:
monoscriptal and biscriptal. Here, we make use of the
biscriptal experience to better understand the nature of the
complexity benefit. Specifically, we address two questions:

Keywords: biscriptal; orthography; visual complexity;
perceptual expertise

Background
Letter perception and identification require detection and
processing of a letter’s component visual features (Grainger,
Rey, & Dufau, 2008). For example, Pelli and colleagues
(Pelli, Burns, Farell, & Moore-Page, 2006) determined that
letters are identified by detecting 7 ± 2 visual features.
While core properties of the human visual system certainly
determine how and which visual features are detected for in
letter identification, there is increasing evidence that the
extent and type of experience with letters influences how the
visual system processes them.
Wiley, Wilson, & Rapp (2016) examined the effects of
both alphabet and expertise on Arabic letter perception by
comparing same/different letter judgments of expert,
biscriptal Arabic-English readers, and naïve, monoscriptal
English-only readers. Among the findings was that letter
complexity, defined as the number of visual features in a
letter1, was associated with slower/less accurate responses
for naïve observers, but faster/more accurate responses for
expert, biscriptal readers. This finding suggests that

Question 1: Is the complexity benefit limited to Arabic
letters?
Question 2: Is the complexity benefit affected by the
amount of expertise with a script?
Question 3: Does biscriptalism affect the perception of
Roman letters?

An alternative definition of complexity, perimeter squared over
ink area, has been used successfully by Pelli, Burns, Farell, &
Moore-page (2006) to account for human efficiency in letter
identification. However, it was found that this measure of
complexity was a significantly weaker predictor of RT in the
same/different judgment, as originally reported in Wiley, Wilson,
& Rapp (2016).

The answers to these questions have implications for our
understanding of whether and how the visual system is
affected by extensive reading experience. There are at least
two relevant hypotheses that are evaluated: (1) the
complexity benefit is a consequence of extensive experience
with letter identification within a specific set (e.g. the
Roman alphabet). In that case, expertise with one script
should have no bearing on the visual processing of another.
(2) The complexity benefit may be related to the manner in
which visual features are processed, regardless of the letter
in which they appear; in this case, expertise with one script
may influence the processing of another, depending on the
extent to which they make use of similar sets of visual

1339

features. This latter possibility would support a “biscriptal
advantage”, such that biscriptal Arabic-English readers
should show a greater complexity benefit than monoscriptal
readers. In addressing these questions, we also determine
whether or not our original finding of a “complexity
benefit” is replicable, whether or not it is an artifact of the
Arabic alphabet, and whether or not it is true of
monoscriptal as well as biscriptal individuals.
The questions are addressed in three experiments. In
Experiment 1, the experimental protocol from Wiley,
Wilson, & Rapp (2016) was used with a considerably larger
sample size of monoscriptal Roman-only readers, with
implementation in Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, with both
Arabic and Roman letters. This experiment directly tests
whether the complexity benefit is unique to the Arabic
alphabet, or whether it is also present in monoscriptal
participants viewing the Roman alphabet.
Experiment 2 is a re-analysis of the data from Wiley,
Wilson, & Rapp (2016), specifically the reaction time
measurements from the same-different judgment task with
pairs of Arabic letters. We separate the expert, biscriptal
participants into two groups, one low-proficiency and the
other high-proficiency, to shed light on whether the amount
of expertise with reading a script affects the magnitude of
the complexity benefit.
Finally, in Experiment 3 we use the same protocol as in
Experiment 2 with new samples of both monoscriptal
(Roman-only) and biscriptal (Arabic & Roman) participants,
viewing both Arabic and Roman letters. This experiment
allows us to address whether expertise with reading one
script affects the perception of a second script, specifically
evaluating whether or not being biscriptal provides an
advantage in terms of the complexity benefit.

Experiment 1: Is the complexity benefit limited
to Arabic letters?
Following Wiley, Wilson, & Rapp (2016): we used a samedifferent judgment task with pairs of letters, using lettershapes from both the Arabic and Roman alphabet. For all
experiments, the questions of interest are addressed on the
basis of reaction times (RT, on correct trials), analyzed
using linear mixed-effects modeling (LMEM; including
random intercepts and slopes by both participants and
items).

Participants
167 participants were recruited online via Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk (MTurk), receiving payment of $7.50/hour
for their participation. 86 participants completed the task
with Arabic letters and 81 with Roman letters. All
participants reported no knowledge of any language written
in a non-Roman script, and thus all are considered
monoscriptal (MS).

Stimuli
A set of 23 letter-shapes from the Arabic alphabet was
presented in Adobe Arabic, in font size 24 (stimuli
subtended 0.17°-0.31° and 0.05°-0.35° of visual angle,
respectively in the vertical and horizontal dimensions). A set
of 23 letter-shapes from the Roman alphabet was also
presented in Arial, font size 16, thereby equating the size
range of the two alphabets.
Both sets of stimuli included 8 pairs of allographs (i.e. 8
letters were presented with two letter-shapes, such as “A”
and “a”; see Table 2). The stimuli are listed in Tables 1 and
2.

Procedure
Each trial began with a central fixation cross (250ms),
which disappeared and was replaced by a pair of letters
simultaneously on either side of fixation, 48 pixels apart.
Each pair of letters was presented for 2000ms or until a
response of “same” or “different” (by pressing either the “a”
or “l” key on the keyboard was recorded. After a response
or two-second timeout there was a 500ms intertrial blank
screen. Participants completed either the task in Arabic or in
Roman letters but not both; the ratio of same to different
trials was 40/60, for a total of 437 trials.

Analysis
Using only correct responses, a single LMEM was fit to the
“same” pairs2 data to determine the effect of complexity
(number of visual features from a list of 14) on reaction
time, and whether this effect differed across groups. The
regression model was fit using R (R Core Team, 2015),
package lme4 (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015),
and confidence intervals for the parameters of interest were
determined using parametric bootstrapping; plots are
provided based on the R package effects (Fox, 2003).
Regression predictors: For the fixed effects, two predictors
of interest were included: the categorical variable Alphabet
(Arabic or Roman, with sum-coding) and the continuous
variable Complexity (total number of visual features,
ranging from 4-12). Two additional predictors were
included as control variables: Trial Order and Previous RT
(reaction time on the preceding trial), to control for trends in
RT across the duration of the experiment. Finally, we
included the interaction Alphabet X Complexity.
The following crossed random effects were included:
random intercepts were included both by participants and by
items, as was a random slope for the effect of Complexity
by participant.

2
Only the “same” pairs are used here because they are used to
measure the effects of visual complexity. The “different” pairs are
discussed in detail in Wiley, Wilson, & Rapp (2016), where they
were used to determine the relative importance of various visual
features (e.g. lines, curves) for letter perception and how that
relative importance differed between naïve and expert observers.

Results
The results are reported in Figure 1. Confidence intervals
are based on 1,000 bootstrap simulations.
The estimated complexity benefit is significant for Roman
letters, beta = -0.014 [-0.017, -0.010], whereas there is a
significant increased RT as the number of features increases
for the Arabic alphabet, beta = 0.005 [0.002, 0.009]. The
interaction between alphabets is significant, a beta
difference = 0.019 [0.015, 0.024].
Summary: The finding that the complexity benefit also
exists for monoscriptal participants in the Roman alphabet
(in which they are experts) is replicated in a large MTurk
sample, as is the finding that the opposite effect (slower RT
on more complex letters) for monoscriptal observers with no
experience in reading Arabic.

Stimuli
The stimuli were a superset of the Arabic letters used in
Experiment 1, for a total of 45 shapes. However only the 23
stimuli used for Experiment 1 are analyzed here in order to
better compare results across experiments.

Procedure
Stimuli were presented using E-Prime 2.0 (Psychology
Software Tools, Pittsburg, PA). Participants completed the
experiment over two sessions, with each session consisting
of 990 trials with a 50/50 ratio of 50/50 same to different
trials. For this analysis, a total of 506 trials were used.

Experiment 2: Is the complexity benefit
affected by amount of expertise?
Experiment 2 is a reanalysis of data originally presented in
Wiley, Wilson, & Rapp (2016). The procedure was the same
as that described for Experiment 1, with the following
differences in participants and stimuli.

Participants
There were 34 participants, all from the Johns Hopkins
University community, who took part in two one-hour
sessions, receiving either course credit or $20 for their
participation. The participants were organized into three
groups:
Low-proficiency biscriptal (L-BS, n = 11): individuals
whose first written language is English and who have had 23 years of studying Arabic.
High-proficiency biscriptal (H-BS, n = 11): individuals
who learned to read and write Arabic simultaneously with
English, or as a second language with at least 4 years of
study.

Results
The re-analysis of data from Wiley, Wilson, and Rapp
(2016) is reported in Figure 2 based on the LMEM as
previously described; confidence intervals are based on
1000 bootstrap simulations.
The estimated beta-weight for the effect of Complexity is
for the MS group = 0.015, 95% CI [0.010, 0.020] Thus, we
again find that among the naïve (monoscriptal) participants
more complex letters lead to significantly slower reaction
times.
For the biscriptal groups, for the L-BS the effect is
estimated = -0.002 [-0.008, 0.002]; and for the H-BS = 0.007 [-0.013, -0.001]. Thus, only the H-BS show a
significant complexity benefit, while the L-BS show only a
trend toward faster RT on more complex letters.
The estimated difference between the MS and L-BS is =
0.017 [0.011, 0.024], and between the MS and H-BS =
0.022 [0.014, 0.029]. Both biscriptal groups show
significantly more negative (hence, more of a complexity
benefit) than the monoscriptal group. The estimated
difference between the two biscriptal groups = 0.005 [0.003, 0.011], with a nonsignificant trend toward a greater
complexity benefit for the H-BS relative to the L-BS.
Summary: Both biscriptal groups show a numerically
larger complexity benefit than the monoscriptal group;
although only for the H-BS group is the complexity benefit
statistically significant.

(n = 7), H-BS (n = 5), and MS (n = 17) for a total of 29
participants.

Stimuli
The stimuli were identical to those used in Experiment 1.

Procedure
The same procedure as Experiment 1 was used, except
participants completed the task for both alphabets separately
across two sessions, with the order (Arabic-Roman or
Roman-Arabic) counterbalanced across participants.

Analysis
The same analysis as described for Experiment 1 was
conducted, plus the addition of the variable Group (MS, LBS, or H-BS, sum-coded) and the 3-way interactions of
Alphabet X Group X Complexity and Alphabet X Group X
Previous RT. The random effects structure was the same as
in Experiment 1, with the addition of (correlated) random
slopes for the effect of Alphabet by participants.

Results
The results from participants completing the same-different
task with both alphabets are reported in Figure 3 (Arabic)
and Figure 4 (Roman). Confidence intervals are based on
1,000 bootstrap simulations.
For the Arabic alphabet, the MS show significantly
slower RTs on more complex letters, beta estimated = 0.013

1342

[0.007, 0.017]. The L-BS show a nonsignificant trend in the
same direction, beta = 0.007 [-0.001, 0.014], whereas the HBS show a nonsignificant trend toward a complexity
benefit, beta = -0.007 [-0.018, 0.001].
While the complexity benefit is not significant within
either biscriptal group, the difference between the H-BS
both of the other two groups is significant: the H-BS betaweight is significantly different than that for the MS, by an
estimated 0.019 [0.009, 0.031] and than the L-BS by beta =
0.014 [0.003, 0.025]. The difference between the MS and LBS is not significant (beta = 0.006 [-0.003, 0.014]).

Summary: We find a similar pattern of results for the
Arabic alphabet as in Experiment 2 with the H-BS group
showing a significantly greater complexity benefit than
either then MS or the L-BS groups. Critically, a complexity
benefit is found for the Roman alphabet for all groups,
including the monoscriptal (English-only) participants,
indicating that it is not an artifact of the Arabic alphabet or
of being biscriptal. The magnitude of the effect is
significantly greater in the H-BS than in either the MS or LBS groups, suggesting a possible biscriptal advantage.

We investigated the role that expertise and biscriptalism
play in the visual processing of letter-shapes. Specifically,
we sought to determine whether: (1) the complexity benefit,
wherein expert readers of a script identify complex letters
significantly more quickly than simpler letters, occurs for
scripts other than Arabic where it was first reported, (2) the
complexity benefit is limited to biscriptal individuals or is
present also in monoscriptals, and (3) there is a biscriptal
advantage for visual processing of letters, such that
biscriptals show a greater complexity advantage or if,
instead, the magnitude of the complexity benefit is simply
tied to the amount of experience with a script. There were
three participant groups: monoscriptal, English-only readers
(MS), and two biscriptal Arabic-English reader groups, one
with four or more years of experience (H-BS) and one with
two or three years (L-BS). We used LMEM to determine the
direction and strength of the relationship between letter
complexity (as defined by the number of visual features),
and whether this relationship differs across groups of
participants and across alphabets.
The results of Experiments 1 and 3 both reveal that the
complexity benefit is not an artifact of the Arabic alphabet.
Monoscriptal participants who participated in the laboratory
or the MTurk experiments all exhibited a complexity benefit
when performing the same-different task with Roman letter
stimuli. Thus, it would seem that the complexity benefit is
not only a general trait of reading expertise, but also is not
unique to individuals with biscriptal experience.
Additionally, the results of Experiments 2 and 3 provide
further details regarding the complexity benefit
phenomenon. While a significant complexity benefit was
not limited to biscriptal individuals, the effect was greatest
in the high-proficiency biscriptal individuals. This group
showed a larger complexity benefit than the other two
groups in both Arabic and Roman scripts. This is
particularly interesting, given that the monoscriptal and
biscriptal participants presumably had comparable expertise
with the Roman alphabet. In fact, if anything the
monoscriptal participants are likely to have had more
experience with the Roman alphabet, as the biscriptal
participants would have spent some of their time reading in
Arabic instead of Roman letters. It is possible that this
division of reading time between the two scripts may

1343

underlie the overall slower reaction times exhibited by this
group, analogous to the rationale provided for some of the
findings in the literature on spoken word production with
bilinguals (Gollan et al., 2008). This possibility will require
more targeted experimental work. Nonetheless, the larger
complexity benefit observed for the high expertise biscriptal
participants indicates that there may be a biscriptal
advantage for processing visual complexity, at least for
letters.
The mechanism underlying the complexity benefit itself is
not yet well understood. There are multiple possible
explanations for why expert observers learn to identify more
complex letters more quickly or accurately. One possibility
is that expertise leads to the creation of new visual
features— such that features are “bundled” together, making
a complex letter no longer complex. For example, the letter
“w” may not be processed as four slanted lines, three
intersections, two terminations, with symmetry and
cyclicity, but instead as fewer features or even a single
feature, “w”. This type of expertise effect is consistent with
findings in perceptual learning research (e.g. Goldstone,
1998; Kellman & Garrigan, 2009; Sireteanu & Rettenbach,
2000).
Another explanation for the complexity benefit is that it is
related to the distinctiveness of letter-shapes within the set
of shapes being processed. Under such an account, a
complex letter like “w” may be easier to identify because its
greater number of features provide more possible ways to
distinguish it from other letters. This is compatible with
findings from visual crowding effects, indicating that a
target is easier to identify within an array of distractors if it
is relatively more complex than those distractors (Bernard &
Chung, 2011; Chanceaux, Mathôt, & Grainger, 2014).
Accordingly, with increasing expertise, one learns not only
the visual properties of each of the letters, but the
distribution of features across the set of letters.
Relatedly, it may be that experts learn a greater number of
ways to identify complex letters relative to simpler letters,
allowing the identification process to terminate sooner. For
example, whereas an observer with minimal experience may
identify “w” only after considering all of its features, an
expert may identify it as soon as some distinct combination
of features (a subset of the total number of features) are
recognized. In this case, a “simple” letter such as ‘l” may be
more difficult to distinguish from other letters, because
while a complex letter like “w” can be identified without
full consideration of all of its features and without searching
for the absence of certain features, an “l” does not afford
these opportunities.
Of these possibilities, perhaps the one most consistent
with a biscriptal advantage would be the creation of new
complex features from simpler features—biscriptal
individuals’ expertise with a wider range of letter-shapes
may result in a larger feature ‘vocabulary’ that allows
relatively more complex shapes to be more readily
processed. In future research, it will be important to
examine if the biscriptal complexity advantage extends to

other types of visual stimuli, and to identify evidence to
adjudicate between possible mechanisms that support the
complexity benefit.
