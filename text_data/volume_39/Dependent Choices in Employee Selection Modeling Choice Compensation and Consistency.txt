moral literature sometimes referred to as moral licensing or
moral cleansing, that even occur without explicit feedback.
We will introduce a computational model in the following

rameter that indicates the individual degree and direction of
sequential effects, it quantifies the tendency for compensation
or consistency with previous choices.
