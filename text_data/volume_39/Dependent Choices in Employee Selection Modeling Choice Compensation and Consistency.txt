Sequential Effects in Employee Selection

Abstract
Past choices can influence subsequent choices in employee selection. Previous approaches rather described similar sequential effects with feedback learning or the misperception of randomness. However, in the selection of job candidates also the
accumulation of the moral impact of previous choices might
influence subsequent choices. We investigated that question
by making two major contributions to the literature. First, we
developed an experimental paradigm for measuring sequential
choices in employee selection and second, we implemented
a widely applicable computational model, the Dependent Sequential Sampling Model, for explaining sequential effects in
choices. By using this methodological approach, we uncovered sequential effects in employee selection. Participants
(N=600) were especially motivated to compensate for morally
dubious choices, with some participants showing consistent
choice behavior if their previous choices had been morally virtuous. These results support the assumption of asymmetric
compensation of morally dubious choices, sometimes referred
to as the moral cleansing hypothesis.
Keywords: sequential sampling model; preferential choice;
sequential decision making; employee selection.

Theoretical Background
Ethical and moral aspect play a major role, when managers
select new employees. In order to enable a fair employee
selection procedure, every candidate is supposed to be evaluated only on her skills and accomplishments relevant for the
position in question. This does not only involve the prohibition of any kind of discrimination, but also demands the
evaluation of every candidate, independent of other candidates and contextual factors. However, interviewers deviate from such a fair evaluation procedure. Discrimination
in the application process for jobs, e.g. based on gender
and skin color, is common (Gregory, 2003; Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004; Pager, Western, & Bonikowski, 2009). And
instead of evaluating candidates independently, previous candidates on the same day influence the evaluation of later candidates (Simonsohn & Gino, 2013). The present article tackles this problem. We will present a theory driven experimental method and computational model for investigating sequential effects in the employee selection and other areas. Our approach aims at first identifying sequential effects and second
quantifying the individual degree and direction of the effects.

Many sequential effects in decision making and choices are
explained with the ”gamblers fallacy”, the misperception of
randomness (Ayton & Fischer, 2004; Clotfelter & Cook,
1993). However, if moral aspects are relevant for the choice,
other factors contribute to the sequential effects as well.
It is often assumed that the moral credentials of previous
choices are accumulated and influence subsequent choices
(e.g. Monin & Miller, 2001; Tetlock, Kristel, Elson, Green, &
Lerner, 2000). This can well be illustrated in the employee selection. Given the common problem of discrimination in the
job market (Gregory, 2003; Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004;
Pager et al., 2009), it is of higher moral value to choose a person belonging to a group discriminated against than a person
belonging to a favored group. This can lead to various potential sequential choice effects. If individuals made a series of
choices for the same group, e.g the group not discriminated
against, they tend to compensate these choices in the following (Conway & Peetz, 2012; Jordan, Mullen, & Murnighan,
2011; Sachdeva, Iliev, & Medin, 2009). While some individuals simply balance morally dubious and morally good
choices (Dhar, Huber, & Khan, 2007; Dhar & Simonson,
1999; Huber, Goldsmith, & Mogilner, 2008), less symmetric compensating choice behavior is also possible. For example, especially after morally dubious choices, people feel
the urge to compensate for these choices with a morally virtuous choice subsequently, referred to as cleansing (Tetlock
et al., 2000). And also the complementary effect has been
observed, referred to as licensing (e.g. Monin & Miller,
2001). Nonetheless, even contrarily to the idea of compensation, consistent choice behavior is also possible (Gneezy,
Imas, Nelson, Brown, & Norton, 2011; Zhang, Cornwell, &
Higgins, 2014).

Modeling Sequential Choice Effects
In most domains of real life choices and decisions, sequential effects have either been explained with models involving
reinforcement learning (e.g. Kruschke, 1992; Gluck et al.,
1988; Rieskamp & Otto, 2006; Simão & Todd, 2002; Stewart, Brown, & Chater, 2002; Stewart & Brown, 2004; Todd,
2007) or the effects are explained with the ”gamblers fallacy”
(Thaler & Johnson, 1990; Novemsky & Dhar, 2005; Chen,

2457

Moskowitz, & Shue, 2016; Ayton & Fischer, 2004; Clotfelter
& Cook, 1993). However, these models do not explain asymmetries in compensating previous choices, which are in the
moral literature sometimes referred to as moral licensing or
moral cleansing, that even occur without explicit feedback.
We will introduce a computational model in the following
that can account for these effects.The model involves one parameter that indicates the individual degree and direction of
sequential effects, it quantifies the tendency for compensation
or consistency with previous choices.

Method
In order to investigate sequential effects in the employee selection, we developed and applied the experimental paradigm
”The Sequential Employee Selection Task”. In previous experiments on sequential effects in the job application process
and other domains, the investigated choice often followed a
different task, e.g. a rating task. Contrarily, participants in
our experiment were faced with repeated choice tasks of the
same format and in the same context.
After a series of choices between two candidates, who
clearly differed in the qualification for the job (dominated
trials), subjects were to choose between two equally qualified candidates (ambiguous trials). In some of the conditions candidates from a group discriminated against (discriminated group) dominated the previous trials, and in other conditions candidates from the complementary favored group
(non-discriminated group) dominated these trials. The following ambiguous trials were the same between the conditions. Thus, different choice probabilities in these ambiguous
trials indicated the influence of the previous trials.
If the choice probabilities in the ambiguous trials systematically differ between the conditions, there exist sequential effects in this task (H1 ). If the probability to choose a candidate
from the same, previously dominating, group is decreased,
compensating choices are observed (H2 ). If the probability increases, participants make consistent choices (H3 ). If
the compensation differs with regard to whether the discriminated or the non-discriminated group dominated the first trials, the compensation is asymmetric and the moral impact of
the choices is accumulated. This finding would indicate sequential effects referred to as moral licensing (H2a ) or moral
cleansing (H2b ). If previous choices are compensated symmetrically, choices are balanced (H2c ). In order to estimate
initial choice biases and the weights of the candidates’ attributes, the manipulated sequences can further be compared
to control conditions, in which only the ambiguous trials, the
same as in the experimental conditions, were tested. As an
additional add-on to previous studies, the sequential effects
were not only tested in one single trial, but four ambiguous
trials, enabling estimation of the individual degree of compensation.

Participants
We recruited participants living in the U.S. through amazon’s
Mechanical Turk (Amazon, 2013). In order to avoid inatten-

tive participants or computer programs filling out the questions, we included an additional test page at the beginning. Of
the 635 recruited participants 600 (95%) passed that screening ( 47% f, mean age= 36.06 ). Those participants received
USD 1.50 for their participation in the 10 minutes experiment.

Design and Procedure
The Sequential Employee Selection Task was manipulated on
2 factors between the subjects, resuming in 6 between-subject
conditions. The sequential effects were investigated in four of
these conditions differing with regard to the salient category,
skin color vs. gender, and with regard to whether the candidates from the discriminated (female or black candidates) or
the non-discriminated group (male or white candidates) dominated the first eight trials. In the two control conditions the
baseline choice probabilities for candidates belonging to the
respective groups were tested.
Participants were presented with a hypothetical recruiting
scenario and asked to repeatedly choose the most suitable
candidate out of two job applicants, see Figure 1 for an example. All candidates were described by three attributes on
scales between 0-100: ”leadership skills”, ”social competence”, and ”typing speed”. The information was presented in
an information board and a profile picture above this board.
On top of it, a fictitious company name served as a title of
the trial. The first two of the attributes were described as
important in the initial instructions, whereas the third was described as a less important attribute for the position. The candidates’ individual levels on the attributes are indicated by the
numbers in the respective cells of the information board. The
profile pictures above the table indicated the gender or the
skin color of the candidates, depending on the condition. Pictures from the Chicago Face Database (Ma, Correll, & Wittenbrink, 2015), only smiling faces, were used for the present
experiment. Participants received no instructions with regard
to the relevance of these personal characteristics and other
features for the position, beyond the instructions on the three

attributes.
Each participant made twelve pairwise decisions in a row.
The description of the task emphasized that the twelve candidate pairs applied for twelve different companies. Furthermore, showing fictitious company names at every decision
stressed that each choice ought to be independent of the previous ones. The procedure of the experiment in the gender
conditions is illustrated in Table 1. The choice pairs were
constructed such that one of the two candidates was clearly
superior on the two most important attributes (i.e. leadership skills and social competence) in the first eight pairs (=
dominated trials), the two relevant attributes provided higher
values for one candidate. Contrarily, the candidates in the
last four pairs were equally well suited for the job (= ambiguous trials). In those trials, one of the relevant attributes had a
higher value for one candidate, whereas the other attribute
provided a higher value for the other candidate. The values of the third attribute were equal between the two. Thus,
even when participants weighted all information for making a
choice between the candidates, this weighted additive would
lead to no preference for one candidate or the other. It was
further controlled, that in two of these ambiguous trials the
candidates from one group and in the remaining two trials the
candidates from other group had a higher value on the first attribute. This procedure allows to control for the common use
of a heuristic which places more weight on the first discriminating attribute (Take-the-best heuristic (TTB) Gigerenzer &
Goldstein, 1996). The order of the trials, within the dominated and the remaining ambiguous trials was randomized,
and the position of the dominated candidates (left or right)
was counterbalanced. However, the first of the ambiguous
trials was fixed so that the the candidate from the discriminated group had a higher value on the first attribute in this
trial. This was done in order to increase the contrast between
the conditions. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of
the conditions.

Formalization of the Dependent Sequential
Sampling Model
In order to explain sequential effects in choices it is assumed
that some information of previous choices must be accumulated in memory and influence subsequent choices. As for
modeling the evidence accumulation models within one trial
(e.g. Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993; Lee, 2004; Newell &
Lee, 2011), sequential sampling models might be used for
modeling this accumulation process across trials as well.
In their simplest form, sequential sampling models assume
that evidence in a given binary choice task is accumulated
from a starting point across a fixed number of steps. After
all fixed steps were made, this option with the highest accumulated evidence is chosen. For the purpose at hand, we
adapted a similar sequential sampling model (Milosavljevic,
Malmaud, & Huth, 2010), for incorporating previous choices.
The starting point of the evidence accumulation process usually represents only any previous bias for one of the options.
In the present study, it was enlarged with incorporating previous choices as well. It was further considered 1) that the influence of previous choices decays exponentially with temporal
distance and 2) that previous choices could potentially lead
to compensation, confirmation or not influence subsequent
choices. The latter, the direction and strength of the influence of previous choices, was governed by the compensationconsistency parameter κ.
Relying on a simple drift diffusion model (Milosavljevic et
al., 2010) we assume that the evidence z in a binary decision
task evolves according to the following equation across all
time steps s:
zs = z(s−1) + µ + εs
(1)
The evidence which is added at every time step is defined by
the speed of evidence accumulation µ, representing the overall difference of the options’ values in the trial µ = VA − VB ,
and an error term εs ∼ N(0, .1). The values of the options V
represent the sum of the option’s attributes weighted with the
attributes’ weights w. If there is no previous bias nor any influence of previous choices, this evidence accumulation starts
at 0. For additionally indicating a systematic bias in a choice
task β is introduced. The parameter describes any initial response bias at the starting point z0 . In a similar vein z0 can incorporate the influence of previous choices. We assume that
the starting point in a given trial t, z0t is further influenced
by ρ = [−1, 1] and a compensating-consistency parameter κ.
The function ρ incorporates the evidence for previous choices
and the memory for it. It is determined as the inner product of
a decay vector and the previous evidence. The decay vector
determines that more recent trials have a greater impact. In
line with previous research on memory, the memory further
decreases as an exponential function. The impact of previous trials increases in those trials, in which the evidence was
sparse.

As has been outlined in the introduction different hypotheses on the direction of the effect in sequential choices have
been formulated. We incorporated these hypothesis in the
compensation-consistency parameter κ = [−1, 1]1 which is
multiplied with ρ for determining the direction of the sequential effect. If κ > 0, previous choices are compensated, if
κ < 0, individuals make consistent choices and if κ = 0, previous choices do not influence the present choice. Following
the starting point z0 in trial t is defined as:
z0t = β − κ × ρt

(3)

Finally, a probit link is applied for predicting the choice probability in any trial t based on the accumulated evidence from
the starting point z0t up to zSt in that trial.
P(A)t = φ(zSt , 0, 1)

(4)

Additionally we introduced a trembled hand error ξ which
indicates the probability to guess between the options.
P(A)t = (1 − ξ) × φ(zSt , 0, 1) + ξ × .5

trials, (Trial Number 9-10), differed between the conditions.
The probability was decreased, compared to the other conditions, if the respective discriminated group had dominated
the previous trials. The choice probabilities in the control
condition serve as a reference for choice probabilities without sequential effects.
For explaining the observed sequential effects, the DSSM
model was fitted to the data. The choice probabilities in
the control conditions were used to inform the parameters of
the DSSM model. The response bias parameter β was fixed
so that Φ(β, 0, 1) corresponds to the averaged probability to
choose a candidate from the discriminated group in the control conditions (P(female/black) = .58). Likewise the decision
weights were adapted for capturing the higher weight on the
first attribute, by adapting the attributes weights w to the ratio of the choice probabilities, in accordance with the first
attribute P(female/black) = .78, or not P(female/black) = .38,
w = (2,1,0). The final model was fitted to the complete data
set of the experimental conditions via grid search and minimizing logloss (logLoss = − 1n Σlog(Likelihood)).
The best fitting parameters for the experimental conditions
and the corresponding logLoss are illustrated in Table 2. The
logLoss for a complete guessing model would be logLoss =
.69. In order to further validate the model we compared it
via BIC to a complete Guessing and a Sequential Sampling
Model SSM without dependencies between the trials. Across
all participants, the DSSM provided a better fit than the guessing model and the SSM, BICDSSM = 1990, BICSSM = 3423,
and BICguess = 6670. The best fitting parameters indicate

compensating choices in all conditions, however the compensation is higher in the conditions in which the candidates from

In order to test the difference of κ between the conditions,
the best fitting parameters for κ were additionally estimated
on the individual level. This comparison revealed significant
differences between the conditions in the gender condition

behavior in the condition in which candidates from the discriminated group dominated the first 8 trials.
To conclude, we observed sequential effects in the sequential employee selection task. In general, participants tended to
compensate for previous choices, especially if these choices
were morally dubious. If the previous choices were of high
moral value, choosing the candidates from the group discriminated against, a large number of participants showed consistent choice behavior.

ber of sequential choices would further allow to increase the
complexity of the model by estimating more parameters on
the individual level, for example the individual initial decision bias. Nonetheless, the current simplicity is perfectly
suited for the present research questions.
We provide strong evidence for compensation of morally
choices in employee selection and the presented experimental
and methodological approach further allows replicating our
findings in other areas as well.

Discussion

References

Present choices between job candidates are influenced by previous, unrelated, choices. Choosing a job candidate consistently from one group over the complementary group, defined
by skin color or gender, decreased the probability to choose
a candidate from the same group in subsequent trials. However, the sequential effects are not symmetric, because not all
choices are equally compensated for. Thus, instead of balancing groups over a series of choices our data support the
assumption of a stronger compensation for morally dubious
choices, sometimes referred to as the moral cleansing hypothesis (Tetlock et al., 2000).
The mere existence of moral cleansing and moral licensing
effects has been questioned recently via series of failed replications (Earp, Everett, Madva, & Hamlin, 2014; Blanken,
Van De Ven, Zeelenberg, & Meijers, 2014). However, the experimental studies investigating these effects rarely observed
multiple similar choices in a row. Those studies rather used
different tasks, investigated behavioral intentions or used
other experimental methods aiming at inducing a specific
mindsets, in order to influence subsequent single choices.
Furthermore, no computational model has been implemented
for analyzing the data. We make two major contribution to
this debate. First, we present an experimental paradigm for
observing sequential effects in the employee selection and
beyond. The task can easily be framed differently in order to
test sequential effects in other contexts as well. Second, we
formalized a computational model, the Dependent Sequential Sampling Model, for describing and explaining sequential
choice effects and corresponding individual differences. Especially the individual estimates of κ via the DSSM indicate
large individual differences with regard to the compensation
or confirmation of previous choices. While κ on the group
level indicated compensation also in the conditions which
were dominated by candidates from the non-discriminating
group, investigating individual estimates identified large individuals differences. Importantly, a meaningful number of
participants showed actual consistent choice behavior (Zhang
et al., 2014; Gneezy et al., 2011).
The DSSM relates to the well established application of accumulator models in choice tasks (Busemeyer & Townsend,
1993; Lee, 2004; Newell & Lee, 2011; Ratcliff, 1978). For
the purpose at hand the model was used in a very simple
version (Milosavljevic et al., 2010). A richer dataset, with
