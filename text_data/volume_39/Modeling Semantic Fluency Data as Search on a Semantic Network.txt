processes are not purely local or global).
   From behavioral evidence alone, it is difficult to infer
properties of human search. For example, clustering in
semantic fluency data has been taken as evidence of a
strategic search process that leverages local cues (Troyer et
al., 1997). To list animals we may start search at a random
animal, say elephant. At this point, it may be more efficient
to limit search to only African animals, as these items are
more accessible. Once search exhausts its store of African                      CRW             A, B, C, D, F, E
