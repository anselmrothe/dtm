Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)
          All participants first completed a brain stimulation
safety screening questionnaire. Stimulation was delivered by
a battery driven, constant current stimulator (Neuroelectrics)
via a pair of surface sponge electrodes (25 cm2), soaked in a
saline solution (0.9% NaCl), and applied to the scalp at the
target areas of stimulation. Electrodes delivered a constant
current of 1.2 mA (current density: 0.048 mA/cm²); the
choice of the intensity is in line with Civile et al. (2016)’s
study (see Neuroelectics website for a review of clinical
studies that suggest keeping the average current densities in
electrodes below 0.06 mA/cm2). As in Civile et al. (2016)’s
study, we adopted a bilateral bipolar-non-balanced montage
with one of the electrodes (anode/target) placed over the left
PFC (Fp3) and the other (Ambrus et al., 2011; Kincses et
al., 2003) was placed on the forehead, just above the right
eyebrow. In the anodal tDCS condition, the current was
applied for 10 mins (fade-in and fade-out of 5 s) from when
the subjects began the computer task and throughout the
old/new recognition task. Sham received the same 5 s fade-
in and fade-out, but only 30 s stimulation between them,
which terminated shortly after the computer task started.
The electrodes were left on the participant throughout the
experiment (see Figure 1, Panel A).
Behavioral Task
          The old/new recognition task consisted of two
parts: a ‘study phase’ and an ‘old/new recognition phase’
(Civile, McLaren, & McLaren, 2014; Civile, McLaren, &
McLaren, 2016). In the study phase, each subject was
shown upright and inverted faces with 32 images for each
type (64 images in total). Faces were presented one at a time
in random order. In the old/new recognition phase, 64 novel
faces split into the same stimulus types were added to the 64
faces seen in the study phase, and all 128 images were              Figure 1: Panel a shows the electrode configuration of the
