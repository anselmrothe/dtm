nals may sometimes gain iconicity over repeated interactions,
even as they otherwise show evidence of conventionalisation.
In Perlman et al. (2015), pairs of participants took turns over
ten rounds creating non-linguistic vocalisations for different
meanings (e.g. big, rough, up). Accuracy within the game in-
creased to ceiling, and vocalisations showed signs of conven-
tionalisation, becoming shorter in duration and more stable
in form. To measure how iconicity changed over this process,
they tested the ability of naı̈ve listeners to guess the meaning
of vocalisations from rounds 1, 5, and 10. Vocalisations from
round 1 were guessed with the lowest accuracy, suggesting
they were the least iconic, but in later rounds, vocalisations
were guessed with higher accuracy. Verhoef, Kirby, and de                      Figure 1: The meanings used in the experiment.

repeated interactions and iterations. Participants used digital
