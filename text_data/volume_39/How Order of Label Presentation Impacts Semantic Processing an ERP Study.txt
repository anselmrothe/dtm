parietal), and three lateral regions (left-central-right).
All analysis, including the determination of time
windows of interest were done with difference waves.
Namely, we substracted ERP wave forms of match
trials from the ERP wave forms of mismatch trials in
order to isolate the N400 component more accurately.
For determining time windows of interest we adopted
an exploratory approach to data analysis. Following the
analysis of Kovic et al. (2010), mean amplitude
measurements were extracted from the continuous EEG
signal into 20 ms bins for each participant across all
experimental conditions. Successive ANOVAs were
conducted on each time bin. Windows of interest were
defined if at least 3 consecutive 20 ms bins were
significant (p < .05). After identification of windows,
mean amplitudes across the window were computed for
each experimental condition, and further analysis
conducted. Two windows of interest (260ms - 440 ms;
440ms – 680ms) were analysed with a 3x3x2 repeated
