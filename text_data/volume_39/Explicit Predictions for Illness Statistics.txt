influenced the unit of time participants used to respond (see
Table 2). For the acute illnesses, multiple units of time can
be used to express the same value; i.e., a one week long
illness can be characterized as seven days or one week. For
seasonal flu and common cold, more than 80% of
participants responded with either the clinical (days) or the
