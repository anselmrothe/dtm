evaluated again their understanding of the object/topic they

low desirability topics within each domain was randomly
assigned.
                           Results
A mixed ANOVA was conducted as the main analysis, with
judgment timing (pre and post explanation) and perceived
social desirability of knowledge on the topic (high and low)
as within-subject factors, and both domain of knowledge
and presentation order as the between-subjects factors. The
dependent variable was the rating in the 7-point

higher than those produced after explanations (M = 2.81,
SE= .10), F (1, 178) = 52.43, p < .001, η2p = .23.
Additionally, there was a significant interaction between
judgment timing and domain of knowledge, F (2, 178) =
3.33, p < .05, η2p = .03. Post hoc analysis (Tukey’s HSD)
revealed that the decrease of understanding ratings was
higher for the historical domain, p <.01 (see Table 2).
   Additionally, social desirability of knowledge interacted
with judgment timing, F (2, 178) = 56.27, p < .001, η2p=.24.
In particular, it was found a decrease on understanding
ratings between judgments before and after the elaboration
of explanations, only for high desirability topics (see Figure
1).
   It was also found a marginally significant three-way
interaction between judgment timing, social desirability and
domain of knowledge, F (2, 178) = 3.06, p = .049, η2p = .03.
Specifically, the reduction of understanding after generating
