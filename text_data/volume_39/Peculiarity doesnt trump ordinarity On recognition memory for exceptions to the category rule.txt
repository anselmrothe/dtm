and the third block participants saw both High Match (20)
and Exception (4) items in random order. At the end of the
third block, we presented additional 2 Exception items. The
logic behind the dynamics described was that in order for
Exceptions to be seen as Exceptions they should be presented
after a representation of High-Match items was formed, and
they needed to be less frequent. Order of presentation was
randomized for each participant.
Memory test
   Memory test was introduced immediately after the training
session. Items were presented individually, followed by the
question „Did you see exactly the same creature in the first
part of the game?“ and two buttons labeled „old“ and „new“.
After participant gave a response, the next trial was
presented. There was no feedback.
   Memory test was given in one block. It had 64 trials in
total, 8 trials of each item type, presented in random order.

Participants had better memory for regular items (A’ scores),
regardless of their age (F (1, 140) = 4.88, p < .05, η = .03).

  In order to test for differences in memory for (P and D)
features, 2 (Age: 4-year-olds, adults) x 2 (Type: regular,
exception) x 2 (Feature: P, D) ANOVA was conducted on A’
scores. The analysis revealed significant main effects of age

As expected based on the previous studies (Deng & Sloutsky,
2016), adults, but not 4-year-olds, have shown differential
memory - specifically better memory for rule than
probabilistic feature. Both age groups had better memory for
features of High-Match items, than those of exceptions
(Figure 4).
