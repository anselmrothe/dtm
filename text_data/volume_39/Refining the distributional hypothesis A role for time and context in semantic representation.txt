frequently indistinguishable (Koriat, 1981; Thompson-Schill et al., 1998). However, the association norms employed in such studies are distinct from the type of
association built through temporal co-occurrence patterns (Jones et al., 2006; Lund, Burgess, & Audet, 1996), and are thus not directly comparable to our findings.
