Abstract
Variance of the outcomes associated with an option often
provides a measure of the riskiness of that option. Hence, it is
important for organisms are able to detect any sudden changes
in outcome variance. In Experiment 1, we presented people
with graphs of share price time series or water level time
series. In half the graphs, variance (financial or flooding risk)
changed at some point. People were better at detecting
increases than decreases in risk - maybe because it is more
important to detect increases in danger than decreases in it.
However, in Experiment 2, people were still better at
detecting increases than decreases in variance even when
those changes did not reflect altered levels of risk. Our
findings may reflect the fact that the actual change in variance
exceeds the change needed to identify a regime change in
variance by a larger amount for upward than for downward
changes.

Introduction
In many domains, variance of outcomes associated with an
option is taken as a measure of level of risk of that option.
For example, in modern finance theory, level of risk
associated with an asset is defined as the standard deviation
of the returns on that asset (Jorion, 2006). Similarly, as
variability in water levels increases, so does the risk of
flooding or drought (Crowell, Coulton, Johnson, Westcott,
Bellomo, Edelman, and Hirsh, 2010). Finally, in foraging
theory, the risk associated with different food sources is
defined in terms of the variance of the energy gains that an
animal can derive from those sources (Kacelnik and
Bateson, 1996). In all these cases, higher variance in the
data is treated as a signal that risk levels are higher.
Most work in these and other domains has been based on
the assumption that the riskiness of different options
remains constant over time. For example, Diacon and
Haseldine (2007), Duxbury and Summers (2004, 2017),
Sobolev and Harvey (2016), and Weber, Siebenmorgen and
Weber (2005) have used various methods to examine the
relation between volatility of financial indicators (e.g.,
returns) and financial risk perception. However, level of risk
can change: variance of outcomes may increase or decrease,
often quite suddenly. As far as we are aware, there have
been no studies of people’s ability to perceive a change in
volatility and, hence, to detect onset of a new level of risk.
Here we ask how easily people are able to detect such a
change when they are given a graphical record of the

outcomes that have occurred. More specifically, we
examine how well people are able to detect a structural
break in the variance of a time series and study whether the
level of their ability is influenced by whether that variance
is framed as representing level of risk.
We varied task frame. In Experiment 1, any structural
break in the series signified an increase or decrease in the
level of risk over time. Changes in financial trading risk and
water flooding risk were of this type. In Experiment 2, any
structural break in the series did not represent any change or
difference in risk level. Instead, participants needed to
detect it because it represented an opportunity rather than a
risk. These experiments were used to address two questions.
First, is there any asymmetry in ability to detect increases
and decreases in volatility? Second, is any such asymmetry
limited to tasks in which changes in volatility should be
interpreted as temporal changes in level of risk? It can be
argued that it is more important to detect an increase in risk
so that protective measures can be adopted. Removing those
protective measures when there is a decrease in risk is likely
to be less critical.

Experiment 1
In this first experiment, participants performed the task
within a temporal risk frame. They were presented with one
of two scenarios: a finance scenario and a flooding scenario.

Method
Participants One hundred and sixty-five students acted as
participants: 59 were assigned to the financial risk scenario
and 106 were assigned to the flooding risk scenario.
Stimulus materials Each graphically presented series
comprised 50 data points generated uniquely for each
participant. They were drawn from a Gaussian distribution
with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of either 5.00
(low volatility) or 15.0 (high volatility). Of the 60 graphs
seen by each participant, 15 were of low volatility
throughout, 15 were of high volatility throughout, 15
contained a change from low volatility to high volatility,
and 15 contained a change from high volatility to low
volatility. The 60 graphs were presented in random order.
When there was a change in volatility, it occurred between
points 11 and 40 inclusive and with equal likelihood. One
third of the graphs of each of the four types contained no
trend, one third contained a shallow upward trend, and one

2162

third contained a shallow downward one. When there was a
trend, the series still started at 500 but was then incremented
or decremented by 0.1 on each successive point. Labelling
of graphs depended on the task frame.
Procedure In the financial risk scenario, the vertical axis
was labelled as ‘price’ and the horizontal axis as ‘hours’
(Figure 1). Participants were told that the series represented
a record of recent stock prices and told that increased
volatility represented increased trading risk. They needed to
detect whether a change in risk had occurred because their
trading strategy would need to change if it had done.

Experiment 1 showing prices that change every hour for a
period of 50 hours and volatility shifting from high to low.

d = z(H) – z(F)
β = exp((z(F)2 – z(H)2)/2)
The sensitivity measure d’ reflects how discriminable
signal (change) trials are from noise (no change) trials, with
higher values indicating better detection performance. The
response criterion measure β reflects the relative strength
the evidence has to reach in order for the organism to
respond that the trial was a change trial, with a value of 1
indicating no response bias, while values below 1 indicating
a bias towards responding ‘change’ (i.e., the evidence for
‘no-change’ has to be stronger than the evidence for
‘change’).
As we are interested only in the effect of increasing as
compared to decreasing volatility, we collapse the data over
the presence and types of trend. Also, note that the signal
detection measures are based on both signal (change) and
noise (no change) trials, and hence we cannot compare
sensitivity and response bias between change and no-change
trials.
Table 1: Mean values of sensitivity (d) and response
criterion (β) in the two types of scenario for detection of
changes in volatility in graphs that started with low
volatility and in those that started with high volatility.

In the flooding risk scenario, the vertical axis was labelled
as water depth and the horizontal axis as ‘hours’.
Participants were told that each graph represented a record
of water levels in various locations and that increased
volatility represented increased risk of flooding. They
needed to detect whether a change in flood risk had
occurred in order to implement flood control measures if it
had increased or to stand them down if it had decreased.
For each graph, participants first gave a yes/no response
to signal whether they had detected a change in the volatility
in it. They then estimated the likelihood that their response
was correct on a 50-100% scale.

Results
Here we report analyses of participants’ detection responses
using signal detection theory (Macmillan and Creelman,
1991). We extracted measures of sensitivity (d) and
response criterion (β) for a) trials starting with low volatility
on the left of the graph that either stayed low or that
changed to high volatility and b) trials starting with high
volatility on the left that either stayed high or that changed
to low volatility. Data were analysed in this way so that we
could use the signal detection measures to compare
detection of change when the series started with low
volatility to that when it started with high volatility. To
obtain d and β, the z-transformations of the hit rate (z(H))
and false alarm rate (z(F)) were first obtained. Then

Mean values of d and β are shown in Table 1. A two-way
analysis of variance on d using starting volatility as a
within-participant variable and temporal frame as a
between-participant variable revealed a strong main effect
of starting volatility (F (1, 163) = 43.82; p < .001; η2 = .21)
and some evidence of an interaction between this variable
and frame type (F (1, 163) = 4.57; p = .034; η2 = .03).
An ANOVA using the same variables on β failed to reveal
any significant effects.

Discussion
The experiment showed that people find it easier to detect
increases in volatility than decreases in volatility. Given that
increases in volatility in the task scenarios corresponded to
increases in risk, this result can be interpreted as showing
that people are better at detecting increases than decreases in
risk. This corresponds to what would be expected from a
functional perspective: it is more important to be sensitive
to increases in risk (so that protective measures can be

2163

implemented) than to decreases in risk (as removal of
protective measures is less urgent). Differences in the size
of the effect in the two scenarios may be related to beliefs
about the nature of the risks and the ease of managing them
in the two cases.
Before committing to this risk-based interpretation of the
effects, it is important to ascertain whether they appear
when the same graphs are presented within a scenario that
does not involve risk.

As before, an ANOVA using the same variables on β
failed to reveal any significant effects.

Experiment 2
In this experiment, participants were presented with a
version of the task in which risk assessment was not
involved. Results were then compared to those obtained in
the previous experiment.

Method
Participants A total of 80 new participants drawn from the
same pool as before performed a risk-free version of the
task.
Procedure Participants were told that the data points
represented the contours of a mountain range. The vertical
axis represented height in meters and the horizontal one
degrees of visual angle. Mountains could be formed of soft
rock that had eroded (low variance) or harder rock that had
not (high variance). They were told that they needed to
detect differences in the contours of the mountains because
mineral deposits tended to occur at the interface of hard and
soft rocks. Identifying such interfaces would trigger groundbased surveys to confirm the presence of mining
opportunities. Thus, a left/right difference in variance was
associated with identification of an opportunity rather than a
risk.
In all other respects, the experiment was the same as
Experiment 1.

Discussion
We obtained the same effect reported in Experiment 1
when participants performed the task within a risk-free
scenario. Assuming left-to-right attentional scanning of the
graphs (Bergen and Lau, 2012; Eviater, 1995; Maas and
Russo, 2003), we can say that they were more sensitive to
an increase in volatility than to a decrease in volatility.
Furthermore, this was true whether or not greater volatility
represented greater risk. The asymmetry uncovered in
Experiment 1 is of a more general nature than we originally
assumed. However, its implications for detection of changes
in levels of risk remain.
There was also a main effect of scenario type on d:
sensitivity was higher in the risk-free scenario. Focusing on
opportunities rather than risks appears to have made the task
simpler for participants.

Results
In the same way as before, the d and β values were
extracted from the data (Table 2). Then an ANOVA was
used to compare the values obtained from the temporal risk
scenarios of Experiment 1 with those obtained from the
risk-free scenario in the current experiment. Starting
volatility (low versus high volatility on the left side of the
graph) was a within-participants variable and task frame
(risk-free versus temporal risk scenarios) was a betweenparticipants variable.
Again, there was a strong main effect of starting volatility
(F (1, 243) = 30.00; p < .001; η2 = .11). However, in this
case, though there was an effect of frame type (F (1, 243) =
10.34; p = .001; η2 = .04), there was no interaction between
frame type and starting volatility. Thus, while people were
better at detecting differences in volatility in the risk-free
scenario, they were better in both types of scenario at
detecting changes in volatility from low to high (assuming
left-to-right scanning in the risk-free scenario) than at
detecting volatility changes from high to low.

General discussion
The experiments show that people find it easier to detect an
increase than a decrease in the variance of a graphically
presented time series. Though changes in risk are realized as
changes in variance in many domains, Experiment 2
indicated that increases in variance are easier to detect than
decreases in variance even when changes in variance do not
correspond to changes in risk level. Here we will outline
two possible explanations for our findings: an explanation in
terms of the processes needed to detect upward and
downward changes in variance and a functional explanation
based on the relative importance of upward and downward
changes in variance.

A process-based account
It is possible that our findings arose because increases in
variance are statistically easier to detect than decreases in

2164

variance. For example, we could ask whether it is
statistically easier to detect the presence of a data point
outside a given distribution (an outlier) than to detect the
absence of a data point expected within that distribution.
Conceivably, more data might be needed to perform the
latter detection reliably.
In fact, to detect an increase in variance, it is not
sufficient to detect a single anomaly: in normal
distributions, we expect one in 22 data points to be more
than two standard deviations away from the mean. To detect
a change in variance, the presence of unexpected data points
outside a reference distribution or the absence of expected
data points within that reference distribution must be
persistent. In other words, there must be evidence of a
regime shift in the variance of the distribution.
There are many different approaches to detecting regime
shifts in the mean of time series but relatively few have
been developed for detecting shifts in the variance of series.
Downton and Katz (1993) developed a non-parametric
bootstrap technique to compute confidence intervals for
discontinuities in variance. However, their approach
requires the series containing the putative regime shift in
variance to be compared to a separate reference series
known to be characterized by homogeneous variance. We
presented our participants with series in which variance did
not change but we did not inform them of this constancy for
particular series. Thus they had no series that they could
treat as a reference series in the manner that Downton and
Katz (1993) require.
Rodionov (2004) developed a sequential algorithm for
early detection of regime shifts in the mean of series. The
advantage of his approach is that it does not require large
amounts of data to be accumulated and can automatically
detect regime shifts in real time. Later, Rodionov (2005)
extended his approach so that it could be used to detect
regime changes in variance in short series in real time.
These features of his approach render it a suitable one for
modeling detection of variance change in our experiments.
The first step is to identify the regime length (l). In our
task, this value would initially be set to 10 because
participants knew there was no shift in the first 10 data
points. The next step is to use an F-test to determine the
critical variance ratio (Fcrit) of two successive regimes that
would be statistically significant. For an l value of 10 and a
p-value of 0.05 (one-tailed), this ratio is 4. The variance of
the initial l values of the series is then used to estimate the
variance of the current regime (Vcur). For the new regime to
be statistically different from the current regime, its
variance (Vnew) should be equal to or greater than the critical
variance (Vcrit↑) if the variance is increasing or equal to or
less than the critical variance (Vcrit↓) if the variance is
decreasing, where
Vcrit↑ = Vcur ∙ Fcrit
Vcrit↓ = Vcur / Fcrit↓
The variance, Vcur, is the sum of squares of zi, where i
spans from the first point of the current regime to i = t cur – 1.
If, at time tcur, the current value zcur satisfies either z2cur >
Vcrit↑ or z2cur < Vcrit↓, this time is marked as a potential point

where a regime shift in the variance has occurred.
Subsequent values (zcur+1, zcur+2 …) are used to verify this
hypothesis by using a Residual Sum of Squares Index
(RSSI).
𝑚

𝑅𝑆𝑆𝐼 = 1/𝑙 ∑ (𝑧𝑖2 − 𝑉𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 ),
𝑖=𝑡𝑐𝑢𝑟

where m = tcur, tcur + 1, …, tcur + l - 1.
If, at any time during the testing period from tcur to tcur + l
– 1, the index turns negative for the case where Vcrit = Vcrit↑
or positive for the case where Vcrit = Vcrit↓, the hypothesis of
a regime shift in variance at time tcur is rejected and zcur is
included in the current regime. Otherwise, time tcur is taken
as a break point at which a regime shift in variance
occurred.
In essence, Rodionov’s (2005) approach first detects an
anomaly and then goes on to determine whether that
anomaly persists over time. A regime shift in variance is
identified only when it does. Because his approach is simple
and requires little accumulated data, it is appropriate for the
statistical detection of regime changes in variance in the
type of task that our participants completed.
In our task, the value of the lower variance was 25 and,
hence, Vcrit↑ = 25 x 4 = 100. The value of the higher
variance (225) exceeded this critical value by a large
amount (125). The value of the higher variance was 225
and, hence, Vcrit↓ = 225/4 = 56.25. The value of the lower
variance (25) was less than this critical value by only a
small amount (31.25). However, the relative difficulty of
two comparative judgments does not depend on the size of
the absolute difference between the stimuli.
According to Weber’s Law, “The stimulus increase which
is correctly discriminated in any specified proportion of
attempts (except 0 and 100 per cent) is a constant fraction of
the stimulus magnitude" (Thurstone, 1959, p. 61). In the
case of upward changes in variance, the change in variance
that participants had to detect (125) as a proportion of the
critical variance (100) was 1.25. In the case of downward
changes in variance, the change in variance that participants
had to detect (31.25) as a proportion of the critical variance
(56.25) was 0.56. Hence the task of deciding whether there
was evidence of a new variance regime would have been
more difficult when the variance decreased from the high to
the low value than when it increased from the low to the
high value.
In terms of Rodionov’s (2005) approach, for each current
value, zcur, it would have been harder to determine whether
z2cur was less than Vcrit↓ than to determine whether it was
greater than Vcrit↑. As a result, the initial assessment of
whether a potential anomaly had occurred at tcur would have
been harder for a downward than for an upward anomaly.
Furthermore, using the RSSI to verify whether the potential
anomaly should be confirmed would have been less
effective for a downward than for an upward anomaly.
We have outlined this process-based account using the
parameters of our experimental task but it could be applied
to any task in which comparative judgments of variance are
made. Of course, other process-based accounts are possible:

2165

the strategy outlined by Rodionov (2005) is not the only
statistical approach to detecting regime change in variance.
Indeed, it is possible that no unitary process-based
explanation would be appropriate to account for the
asymmetry in our data. We may have evolved so that the
characteristics of the processes that detect upward and
downward changes in variance are different. It is to this
possibility that we turn next.

A functional explanation
A sudden increase in volatility can be regarded as a signal
onset and a sudden decrease in volatility as a signal offset.
Work in psychophysics indicates that people are better at
detecting the onset of a signal than the offset of one (e.g.,
Ahumuda, Marken, and Sandusky, 1975). This phenomenon
can be given a functional interpretation, albeit a more
general one than that we proposed when discussing the
results of Experiment 1. The onset of a signal is likely to be
of greater importance to an organism than the offset of one.
Signal onsets (e.g. the appearance of a predator) are more
likely to require urgent and rapid action than signal offsets
(e.g., the disappearance of a predator).
One objection to this account is that differences in signal
importance should be expected to affect response bias (β)
rather than sensitivity (d). If a signal is more important, the
response criterion should be shifted to the left to increase
the proportion of hits. In other words, there should be no
difference in d values for detecting signal onsets and
offsets. Instead, responses should be more biased in favour
of saying there is a change when signals start low but may
change to high (potential signal onset) than when they start
high but may change to low (potential signal offset).
The problem with this approach is that shifting the
response criterion to the left will also serve to increase the
proportion of false alarms. Responding to these false alarms
is likely to be costly. For example, animals reacting to a
non-existent predator may lose foraging time and flee into a
more dangerous environment. These high costs would tend
to force the response criterion rightwards and so counteract
the benefit-driven increase in hit rate arising from moving it
leftwards. According to this functional account, evolution
resolved this dilemma over time by increasing sensitivity to
signal onsets. Such a strategy would avoid the increased
costs arising from the additional false alarms associated
with a laxer response criterion while still assuring the
benefits of a high hit rate.

Implications
Although the phenomenon that we have identified is not
specific to identification of changes in risk, it still has
implications for risk perception. In finance, sudden changes
in series variance occur (Hammoudeh and Li, 2008; Todea
and Petrescu, 2012). Although attempts to predict these
changes have been made using autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and generalized autoregressive
conditional
heteroskedasticity
(GARCH)
models

(Bollerslev, 1986; Engle, 1982), severe problems in
forecasting them remain.
For Mandelbrot (1997), this was not surprising. He argued
that bursts of high volatility are inherently unpredictable and
emerge naturally as a consequence of the nonlinear
processes responsible for generation of financial series. He
claimed that these series do not meet the assumptions of
modern financial theory (e.g., Markowitz, 1959; Sharpe,
1964; Black and Scholes, 1973) but are, instead, fractal. If
he is correct, technical analysts and traders cannot possibly
predict sudden volatility changes in financial series. Instead,
all they can do is to be alert to the possibility that such
changes will occur and then react to them appropriately as
soon as possible.
Assuming that sudden volatility changes in financial
series are not predictable, how would the asymmetry that we
have identified here affect trading behavior? Increases in
risk may lead investors to sell winning shares to lock in
their profits but to keep losing ones in the hope that high
volatility will provide an opportunity of selling them later at
a higher price. Decreases in risk should lead to investors
keeping their winning shares because nothing untoward will
happen but to sell their losing shares because there is no
chance of their bringing in a higher price later if they are
retained. Easier detection of an increase than a decrease in
volatility will lead responses to increases in risk to dominate
responses to decreases in risk. In other words, the tendency
to sell winning shares but to retain losing ones will
dominate. This is the disposition effect (Shefrin and
Statman, 1985). While we would not wish to claim that
easier detection of increases than decreases in risk is the
only driver of the effect, it may be contributory.
In our experiments, we presented time series graphically.
We could explain our results by assuming a) that graphs
were scanned left to right so that earlier data points were
encountered before later ones, and b) that signal onsets are
easier to detect than signal offsets. Both these assumptions
are supported by existing evidence in the literature.
Consider now the case where the data points are
encountered sequentially in real time. We would no longer
need to make the first assumption: the earlier points would
be encountered before later ones anyway. Hence, given that
the second assumption holds, we would expect the
asymmetry to be maintained. In other words, our findings
could be expected to generalize to situations in which
people experience data points successively over a period in
real time.
For example, situations in which operators of some
system receive readings in this way but assess volatility
judgmentally rather than formally may produce a greater
tendency to implement measures to protect against
increased risk than to remove those measures once the
period of increased risk has passed. Such situations could
include those associated with natural hazards, such as
evacuation decisions in the case of potential volcanic
eruptions or hurricanes.
We would not wish to claim that asymmetric tendencies
to respond to increases and decreases in risk in such cases

2166

should be characterized as cognitive biases. In line with the
functional approach discussed above, they may represent
sensible ways of responding to changes in risk levels.
