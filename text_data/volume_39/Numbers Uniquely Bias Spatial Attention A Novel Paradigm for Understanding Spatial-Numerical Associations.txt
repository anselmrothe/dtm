Experiment 1: Place-the-number task
Method
In this novel paradigm, participants viewed an Arabic
numeral (1-9) presented in black font within a rectangle
(white fill with black outline; 918 × 495 pixels). This task
was created in Visual Basic and presented on a 19in
computer monitor. Participants sat approximately 65cm
from the monitor. Each digit was presented 20 times, for a
total of 180 trials, randomly ordered. On each trial,
participants were instructed to remember the location of the
digit. The digit remained on screen until participants clicked
a button located at the bottom of the screen, at which time
the digit disappeared. Participants were then instructed to
click the remembered location to place the digit at that
location. These instructions were presented in a pop-up
dialog box, which also ensured that participants did not
fixate on the original location of the digit. Participants could
further adjust this initial placement by dragging and
dropping the digit. Participants then confirmed their final
placement by clicking another button on screen and
immediately proceeded to the next trial.                              Figure 1: Scatterplot displaying mean spatial bias (final –

Results
The remaining participants (N = 36) had a mean accuracy of
14.25 pixels (SD = 7.62). Importantly, unlike Experiment 1,
participants’ slopes were not significantly different from
zero, t(35) = -.85, p = .40. These results demonstrate that
letters, although ordinal, do not generate a spatial
association in this paradigm. However, since the letters used
only spanned the beginning of the alphabet, it remains
possible this sequence was not comparable to the Arabic
numerals used in Experiment 1. The following experiment
was designed to address this concern.
