                              Abstract
   Theories of the mental processes people use to perform physi-
   cal reasoning often differ on whether they are based on simu-
   lation or on logical reasoning. Here we test how these different
   processes might combine in a motion-prediction task that can
   be solved either by simulation or by reasoning about the topol-
   ogy of the scene. Participants were asked to predict which of
   two goals a computerized ball would reach first, but in some
   of these scenes the ball was ‘contained’ in the same space as
   one goal but was topologically separated from the other. Even
   in these contained scenes, participants responded faster when
   they received motion information that would speed up simu-
   lation but not affect topological parsing. This suggests that
   simulation contributes to predicting short-range motion, even
   when alternate strategies are available.

   Although motion towards the goal speeds reaction times
across all trial types, we can test whether participants were
simply cued to respond faster in general when the ball is
moving towards the goal, or whether there is evidence that
these judgments are based on simulation. If people are using
simulation, then as the ball travels further to reach the goal
we would expect mental simulations to also travel a longer
path and thus take more time to produce (Moulton & Koss-
lyn, 2009). We therefore expect that reaction times should
increase roughly in line with the time it takes the ball to ac-
tually reach the goal.3 As can be seen in Figure 5, there is a
relationship between the actual travel time of the ball and par-
ticipants’ reaction time on that trial across all of the topologi-
cal trials (r = 0.29,t(142) = 3.5, p = 0.00056), but we do not
have evidence that this relationship differs between the “to-
wards” and “away” conditions (F(1, 141) = 0.76, p = 0.38).4
This relationship suggests that simulation was in general used
