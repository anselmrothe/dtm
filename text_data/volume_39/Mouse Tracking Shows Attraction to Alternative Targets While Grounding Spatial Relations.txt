   Fig. 2: Mean trajectories and comparisons between conditions. Trajectory plots show the distance from the direct path to the
   target (x=0) against the proportion of elapsed movement time. Negative values indicate leftward deviation and vice versa.
   Conditions compared within a panel differ with respect to the position, relative to the direct path, of either the center of mass
   (CoM), the reference item (Ref), or the distracter (Dtr). Blue and red circles in the top of each plot indicate the direction in
   which the item of interest was situated for the trajectory in the same color. Gray dotted lines represent the mean across all
   trajectories in the two compared conditions. Color-coded p-values and effect sizes (absolute Cohen’s d) for each time step
   are shown on the left and right side of each plot. The black line on the left side of each plot indicates individual significant
   t-tests (p < 0.01) at the spanned time steps. Asterisks next to these lines indicate overall significance (p < 0.01) for a given
   sequence of individually significant time steps (based on bootstrap criterion; see Methods for details). A bar graph below
   each trajectory plot shows the distribution of trials over categories relevant for counter-balancing in the respective comparison;
   bars correspond to trajectory lines of the same hue. (a) Mean across all trials. (b) Means by CoM side, (c) by reference side,
