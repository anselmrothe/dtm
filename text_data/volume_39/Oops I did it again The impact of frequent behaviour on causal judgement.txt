(“infrequent behaviour”). Furthermore, there is a company
policy that determines that Agent 1 and Agent 2 are either
allowed to use the printer anytime they want, or only on
selected days.
As the CEO of your startup, you officially rule that both Agent 1 and Agent 2
are allowed to use the printer whenever they want [Agent 1 is only allowed
to print on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Agent 2 only on Mondays and
Wednesdays.]
By printing on e.g. a Monday, Agent 1 conforms to the
company policy in case of the liberal printer policy (“moral
norm conformation”) or violates the company policy in case
of the selective policy (“moral norm violation”). Combined
with the frequency manipulation, Agent 1 therefore conforms
to or violates the policy, and does so frequently or
infrequently. In contrast, Agent 2 prints frequently during the
week, and always only on the days on which she is allowed
to print. Each day of the week is successively presented.
On Monday, X uses the printer for printing the new flyer design.
On Tuesday, X uses the printer for printing the program outline.
On Wednesday, X uses the printer for the printing of the new logo.
On Thursday, X uses the printer for printing out the schedule.
After the presentation of one week, i.e. the Monday after the
start of the scenario, both agents simultaneously send printing
orders to the printer and it crashes.
On the following Monday, you come into the office and the printer is broken.
Both Agent 1 and Agent 2 have sent printing orders to the office printer
today. This is bad because your start up currently does not have the budget
to afford a new high quality colour printer.
The company policy is either introduced at the beginning of                         Figure 1. Experimental design with the norm introduced on
