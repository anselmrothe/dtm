auditory processing and cognitive tests between SLD and TD
children. The test scores were dependent variables whereas
group distribution was independent variable. The partial least
square regression-structured equation modeling was used to
note the relationship between the test carried out for cognitive
skills and auditory processes. Further, it was also used to find
out the correlation between cognitive abilities and auditory
processes in SLD children.                                           Figure 1: Box plots are representing the scores obtained for

                           Results
The data obtained from descriptive statistical analysis for
auditory processing tests and cognitive tests are presented in
Figure 1 and 2, respectively as box plots. The mean scores for
all the tests (except DPT) were better for TD children in
comparison to SLD children. The results of one way ANOVA
are shown in Table 1. Statistically significant differences,
between TD and SLD groups were found in all the tests of
auditory processing and cognitive skills, except for DPT. It

50% variance in the test scores (partial eta square was greater
than 0.5). An exception to this was word recognition in noise
scores and forward digit recall scores, where the effect size
was greater than 0.3 only.
      The correlation between cognitive skills and auditory
processing abilities were measured using partial least square
regression. A formative model was created where working
memory and attention were considered as latent variables and
the measures to assess working memory (digit and operation
span) and attention skills (dichotic digit test scores) as
observed variables. The effect was seen on three measures of
auditory processing i.e., auditory closure, binaural integration     Figure 2: Box plots are representing the scores obtained for

Figure 3: The structure equation model showing the association of cognitive skills (in terms of working memory and attention
skills) with auditory processing (in terms of auditory closure, binaural integration and temporal processing). The eclipse and
rectangle are used to represent latent and observed variables, respectively. In the eclipse, adjusted R2 values are given, and
those between the arrow bars are path coefficients of the model.
