Abstract
The study assessed the auditory processing abilities and the
cognitive skills in children with specific learning disability. It
investigates the top-down or bottom-up influence on auditory
processing. Using a test battery approach, the association
between cognitive skills (verbal working memory and
attention) and auditory processing abilities (auditory closure,
binaural integration and temporal processing skills) has been
measured. The results revealed that cognitive processes
significantly affect the bottom-up auditory perception. The
effect of cognition was more evident in speech processing than
non-speech signal processing. These findings may be useful in
designing appropriate therapeutic protocol for children with
specific learning disability.
Keywords: dyslexia; learning disability; psychoacoustics;
speech perception.

Introduction
Auditory processing involves the ability of the auditory
system to localize and lateralize sounds, discriminate and
recognize auditory patterns, temporal aspects of signal, and
understanding the auditory information in degraded listening
environments (ASHA, 1996; Bellis, 2003; Chermak &
Musiek, 1997), efficiently and effectively. Any disturbance
in perceptual processing of the auditory information is
referred to as auditory processing disorders (ASHA, 1996).
Auditory processing is affected in individuals with
peripheral hearing loss (Neijenhuis, Tschur, & Snik, 2004),
elderly population (Atcherson, Nagaraj, Kennett, & Levisee,
2015), with certain neurological disorders (Klein et al.,
1995), psychological disorders (Iliadou et al., 2013),
developmental disabilities like attention deficit hyperactive
disorders (Chermak, Somers, & Seikel, 1998), dyslexia
(Hugdahl et al., 1998), learning disability (Kraus et al., 1996),
specific language impairment (Cohen, Campbell, &
Yaghmai, 1989), and others. Studies have indicated that
children with learning disability show inability in processing
complex auditory information (Merzenich et al., 1996). This
processing problems have been attributed to the
neurophysiological encoding of the speech stimuli and higher
level processing deficits (Studdert-Kennedy & Mody, 1995).
Lui et al. (2009) have suggested top-down processing deficit
of semantic tasks in auditory modality in children with

reading disability. Verbal working memory, which is the
ability to store acoustic information for a short period and
plays important role in speech perception (Ingvalson, Dhar,
Wong, & Liu, 2015), is affected in LD children (Alloway &
Alloway, 2010; Wiguna, Wr, Kaligis, & Belfer, 2012).
Attention deficits have also been found to be prominent in
children with learning disability (Finneran, Francis, &
Leonard, 2009). Pinheiro et al. (2010) have reported that LD
children have displayed poor divided attention abilities in
dichotic listening tasks. In auditory stroop task, selective
attention, i.e., the ability to focus on relevant auditory
information while ignoring the irrelevant information, has
been found to be affected in these children (Faccioli, Peru,
Rubini, & Tassinari, 2008).
Researchers have reported that deficits in the cognitive
abilities in the form of verbal working memory and auditory
attention have been found in case of LD children. Therefore,
it was hypothesized that the cognitive abilities may be
associated with auditory processing disorders in LD children.
Hence, in the present study, some auditory processing
abilities and cognitive skills were assessed in children with
specific learning disability.

Methodology
Participants
A standard group comparison research design was adapted.
31 children (17 males and 14 females) diagnoses as specific
learning disability (SLD) by qualified speech language
pathologist as per DSM-5 criterion (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013) were included. Equal number of typically
developing children (TD) were also selected (n=31). The
children in both SLD and TD group were native Kannada
speakers and belonged to similar socio-economic and cultural
background. All the children were within the age range of 810 years and were having normal hearing sensitivity
(PTA<15 dBHL; SRT+10 dB of PTA; SIS>90%). All
children had average or above average intelligence (I.Q.>90)
as assessed by the school psychologist. None of the child had
any associated speech, language, otological, psychological
and/or neurological problems. The study adhered to the rules
of the institutional ethical board and approved to test human

2273

subjects. An informed written consents were obtained from
either parents or teachers of all the participant before
commencing the tests.

Assessment of Auditory Processing Abilities
Tests to assess auditory closure, binaural integration,
temporal resolution, temporal pattern recognition and
temporal masking were selected. Auditory closure is the
ability to fill-in the missing auditory information when the
external redundancy in the acoustic signal is reduced. Time
compressed speech test (TCST) and word recognition in
noise test (WRS) were used to assess auditory closure
abilities. TCST comprised of 40 standardized Kannada
sentences (a Dravidian language) with 3-4 words. These
sentences were divided into 2 sets by randomly assigning the
sentences into sets, i.e. 20 sentences per set. The sentences
were processed to have 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% of temporal
compression. The participants were expected to repeat the
complete sentence as the compressed sentences were
presented.
WRS consisted of five lists with 30 standard Kannada
words per list. Each list was processed with steady-state noise
to obtain a SNR of -9, -6, -3, 0 and +3 dB. The participants
were expected to repeat the words as they heard. A detailed
description of the stimulus parameter is available elsewhere
(Jain, Vasudevamurthy, & Raghavendra, 2015).
Auditory fusion test was used to measure binaural
integration skills. The test comprised of standardized
Kannada bisyllabic words, where first syllable of the word
was presented in to one ear and the corresponding second
syllable was presented in other ear, simultaneously. The
participants were expected to say the whole word. Two lists
of 30 words each, were presented randomly. The lists were
constructed in such a way that a syllable which was in the
initial position in one word would also occur in the final
position of any other word. This reduced the syllabic position
effect.
Temporal resolution abilities were measured using
temporal modulation transfer function (TMTF) at 8, 60 and
200 Hz modulation frequencies. The stimulus was a 500 ms
Gaussian noise that was modulated at specific frequency.
Using a two alternative force choice method, the participants
were asked to identify the interval containing a modulated
noise. 90 sound sequences were presented by adapting the
maximum likelihood procedure which was implemented
using Matlab (Grassi & Soranzo, 2009).
Temporal pattern recognition was measured using duration
pattern test. The test stimuli, as suggested by Musiek (1994),
consisted of a 1000 Hz pure tone generated using audacity
software (ver. 1.3.14 beta). Two tones, one with 500 ms and
another with 250 ms, were used. The tones were patterned in
six different combinations such that one tone was presented
once while other tone was presented twice, with an inter-tone
interval of 300 ms. The participants were asked to repeat the

sequence in which tones were presented. Each tone sequence
was presented at least five times.
Temporal masking skills were measured using backward
masking test by following the maximum likelihood
procedure implemented using Matlab (Grassi & Soranzo,
2009). The test stimulus was a 1000 Hz tone of 20 ms
duration which was presented immediately before a 300 ms
band pass noise (400-1600 Hz). The participants were asked,
using a two alternative force choice method, to identify the
noise interval which had a tone. 90 pair of sounds were
presented.

Assessment of Cognitive Skills
The cognitive skills were assessed in terms of verbal
working memory, divided attention and selective attention.
Auditory digit span test (Blackburn, 2011) and operation
span test (Kane et al., 2004) were used to assess verbal
working memory. In digit span test, sequence of digits were
presented binaurally and participants were asked to repeat the
sequence in either the same order (forward digit span) or in
the reverse order (backward digit span) of presentation. The
stimuli were presented in the increasing order of the number
of digits. The testing started from two digits level and moved
up to ten digit level. Three trials at each level were given and
when the participant responded 2/3 trials correctly, the next
level of test was administered. The maximum number of
digits repeated correctly were considered as the thresholds.
The operation span test based on the study of Kane et al.
(2004), has been standardized in Kannada by Jain and Kumar
(2016). In this test, the target stimuli (phrases varying from
two to five bi-syllabic words) were presented along with a
secondary task (a mathematical operation). Participantâ€™s task
was to solve the mathematical problem and label it as correct
and incorrect and subsequently say the word in the order of
presentation. For two word sentences, each correct word
repeated was given a score of 0.5; for three word sentence,
each correct word repeated was given a score of 0.33; and so
on, till five word sentence where each correctly repeated
word was given a score of 0.2. In total, 12 such sentences
were presented (three in each phrase length) and the scores
were given out of 12 (each sentence carried a total score of
one, when all the words were correctly repeated).
The attention skills were measured for divided attention
and selective attention task using dichotic digit test (Musiek,
1983). The test comprised of pair of digits presented
binaurally. In the divided attention task (free recall), the
participants were expected to repeat all the digits presented
to them. In selective attention tasks (force recall), the
participants focused their attention to one ear only and
repeated the digits presented to that ear while ignoring the
digits being presented to other ear. Total 30 pair of digits
were presented randomly for each task.

Procedure
The testing was carried out in a sound treated room. The
stimuli were presented binaurally at the participantâ€™s
comfortable loudness level which varied from 65 dB to 80 dB
HL, using TDH-39 headphones connected to computer based
audiometer (Interacoustics AD-629). The testing took at least
2-2.5 hours for each participant and was conducted in two
sitting for the consecutive days. Using this procedure,
participants of both the groups were tested and data was
collected.

standardized root mean residual of 0.036 (Hu & Bentler,
1998).

Data Analysis
Logistic regression with linear or non-linear interpolation
was used to measure SNR-50 (SNR level at which
participantsâ€™ responded correctly, at least for 50% stimuli) for
word recognition scores in noise and compression-50
(compression level at which 50% correct identification of
sentences was obtained) for time compressed speech test. The
data was normally distributed across groups as per ShapiroWilk test for normalcy (p>0.05) and hence parametric
statistics was used. One way analysis of variance was used
estimated the significance of differences of scores for
auditory processing and cognitive tests between SLD and TD
children. The test scores were dependent variables whereas
group distribution was independent variable. The partial least
square regression-structured equation modeling was used to
note the relationship between the test carried out for cognitive
skills and auditory processes. Further, it was also used to find
out the correlation between cognitive abilities and auditory
processes in SLD children.

Figure 1: Box plots are representing the scores obtained for
tests to assess auditory processing abilities.

Results
The data obtained from descriptive statistical analysis for
auditory processing tests and cognitive tests are presented in
Figure 1 and 2, respectively as box plots. The mean scores for
all the tests (except DPT) were better for TD children in
comparison to SLD children. The results of one way ANOVA
are shown in Table 1. Statistically significant differences,
between TD and SLD groups were found in all the tests of
auditory processing and cognitive skills, except for DPT. It
was also specific learning disability accounted for more than
50% variance in the test scores (partial eta square was greater
than 0.5). An exception to this was word recognition in noise
scores and forward digit recall scores, where the effect size
was greater than 0.3 only.
The correlation between cognitive skills and auditory
processing abilities were measured using partial least square
regression. A formative model was created where working
memory and attention were considered as latent variables and
the measures to assess working memory (digit and operation
span) and attention skills (dichotic digit test scores) as
observed variables. The effect was seen on three measures of
auditory processing i.e., auditory closure, binaural integration
and temporal processing. The model had good fit with

The regression model is presented in Figure 3. It was noted
from the figure that the adjusted R2 indicated 71.6% of
variance in the auditory closure abilities were associated with
attention skills and working memory. Similarly, 67.5%
variance in binaural integration abilities, and 91% variance in
temporal processing abilities were attributed to cognitive
skills. It was also noted that attention was highly correlated
to auditory processing than with working memory. Among
the working memory tests, backward digit recall represented
the working memory skills maximally. Attention skills were
better represented in terms of divided attention. Similarly,
TCST was found to be a more reliable measure to assess
auditory closure. The temporal processing abilities were
better represented by backward masking test.

Discussion
The present study measured the association between
cognitive skills and auditory processing in SLD children. The
results of ANOVA revealed significant differences on all the
measures of auditory processing and cognition between SLD
and TD children (except DPT). Many researchers have
reported disorders of auditory processing in LD children
(Cohen et al., 1989; Dawes & Bishop, 2010; Kraus et al.,
1996). Therefore the assessment of SLD, using series of tests
of auditory processes, like in the present study may provide
better information about SLD. Further, cognitive abilities
have also being examined previously in such children
(Alloway & Alloway, 2010; Faccioli et al., 2008; Finneran et
al., 2009; Pinheiro et al., 2010; Wiguna et al., 2012), but the
relationship between cognition and auditory processing has
not been investigated intensively. Such investigations, like in
the present study, would lead to better understanding of the

relative contribution of top-down or bottom-up processes
involved in auditory perception.
At times, it seems that the structured equation modeling
used in the present study is under powered, as the sample size
is small. However, the power analysis run with effect size of
0.5 and the power coefficient of 0.95, for five predictor
variables (the variables assessed the cognitive skills)
indicated that total sample size should be 42. In the present
study, although the sample size for SLD children is 31 only,
is it is not much lesser than the suggested sample size. Thus,
it was considered that SEM should be a reasonable tool to
assess the association between auditory processing abilities
and cognitive skills.
The association between cognitive skills and auditory
processing are highly significant. Both attention and working
memory seems to be influencing auditory processing, and the
contribution of attention seems to be more than working
memory, especially for temporal processing. Therefore, the
findings of the present study may be considered as suggesting
the influence of cognitive skills on auditory processing.
Similar findings have been reported by other researchers
(Moossavi et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2013) in normal
children. Based on the present results, it may be extended to
SLD children also.
In the present study, most of the tests used speech stimuli,
and the results suggest that the cognition was influencing the
auditory processing of speech than auditory processing of
tonal/noise perception. â€¦.speech test and cognition
(correlation) Similar findings have been investigated by
several other investigator (Fedorenko, 2014; HÃ¤llgren,
Larsby, Lyxell, & Arlinger, 2001; Larsby, HÃ¤llgren, Lyxell,
& Arlinger, 2005). Word recognition in noise required the
processing of both speech and non-speech stimuli, showed
the path coefficient of WRS (in noise) was 0.379. This also
suggest the contribution of cognition in auditory processing
of speech more than for non-speech stimuli. This further
strengthen the conclusion that the cognition has greater
influence on auditory processing of speech.

Conclusion
The present study examined the association between
cognitive abilities and auditory processing, and highlights the
cognitive influence on auditory processing. The findings of
the study indicate that the cognitive abilities are associated
with auditory processing in SLD children also like in normal.
It has also been found that the cognition is associated with
auditory processing of speech more than non-speech signal.
These findings may be useful in understanding speech
perception in SLD children and may be used in designing
appropriate speech and language intervention techniques.
