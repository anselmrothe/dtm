   In the present investigation, we aim to build and test a
Rational Adapter model of semantic priming against neural
N400 component data. Specifically, we use data from Lau
and colleagues (2013). Here, the N400 semantic priming
effect was measured first in block 1 where 10% of the trials
were related, and then in block 2 where 50% of the trials
were related. We use the block 1 only to inform the prior,
which is then fed into the Rational Adapter model to
predict N400 amplitudes in block 2, as participants’ beliefs
about the predictive validity of the prime adapt.
   We hypothesize that this Rational Adapter surprisal
model will better account for the N400 data than a non-
learning model of N400 data. Specifically, we hypothesize
that the size of the N400 effect (the difference in amplitude
of the N400 evoked by related and unrelated target words )
will increase rapidly near the beginning of block 2, as the           Figure 1: Block 2 N400 amplitudes over trials.
