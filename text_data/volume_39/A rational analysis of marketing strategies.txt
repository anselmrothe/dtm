Figure 1: (Left) The effects of increasing the baserate of a particular brand context (p(c)) via advertising without aiming to
associate the brand with particular products: Increasing the baserate of c increases how often observers would choose brand
c when they are buying something (p(c|b)), but does not increase their propensity to purchase given exposure to the brand
(p(b|c)). (Middle) In contrast, if increased brand exposure coincides with increasing the association of that brand with desirable
goods (p(x|c)), consumers will also be more likely to purchase goods given that brand (p(b|c) increases). (Right) This increase
in propensity to purchase goods by brand c coincides with an increment in the marginal demand curve for brand c: p(b|m, c) is

goods reduces observers’ internal estimates of the price distribution p(m|c), (middle) which promotes their propensity to make

in an increase in p(b|c) – a measure of brand equity. All changes are measured from baselines estimated on the initial event
