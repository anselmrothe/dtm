group of children during “circle time.” The parent sat on a
seat in a different corner of the room. All children were read
each of the three stories. For each child all three stories were
presented in the same format (e.g., two illustrations per
spread). No dialogic techniques, such as giving definitions
for novel words or pointing, were used during the readings.
Story-order was counterbalanced across children.
   After reading the final story, the experimenter proceeded
to the test phase, which began with four warm-up trials to
get the child used to pointing to pictures in the test booklet
and to ensure the child understood the task. The
experimenter opened the test booklet to one of the warm-up
trial pages and asked the child to point to one of the familiar
objects (e.g., “can you point to the plane?”). Across the four
counterbalanced warm-up trials, children were asked to
point to an object in each quadrant of the page. Next, the
experimenter tested word learning. On each trial the
experimenter turned to a different test page and asked the
child to point to one of the novel objects. In total children
were asked to point to each target novel object twice (see           Figure 2. Proportion of correct word learning trials for
