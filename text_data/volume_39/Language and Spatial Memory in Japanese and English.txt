Abstract: Demonstratives are among the most frequent words in all languages, but demonstrative systems vary considerably
between languages. In two experiments, we tested demonstrative use and the influence of demonstratives on spatial memory in
Japanese and English – languages with purportedly very different demonstrative systems. Participants engaged in a ‘memory
game’, tapping their use of demonstratives to describe objects located on a sagittal plane (Experiment 1) and the influence
of demonstratives on memory for object location (Experiment 2). In addition to distance from speaker, the experiments also
manipulated the position of a conspecific (next to or opposite participants). Distance and position of conspecific both affected
demonstrative choice and memory in Japanese, with similar effects in English even though English does not explicitly encode
the position of a conspecific. We discuss possible universals underlying demonstrative systems and the influence of language
on memory.
