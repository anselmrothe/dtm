Table 5: Effects of log-transformed #ctxt and log-transformed #MWUs. The effects of #ctxt and #MWUs were calculated after
those of the co-variates had been included. Unique effects are those with the indicated variable entered last (i.e. #ctxt after
covariates + #MWUs, or #MWUs after #ctxt + covariates). I = inhibitory effect of indicated variable.
