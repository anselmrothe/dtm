Abstract

the fovea and suffer from a rapid drop in acuity, leading to
poorer visual information about the overall word. Following
this interpretation, it is hypothesized that visual processing efficiency of a word is maximized when fixating at word center,
and decreases with increasing distance between word center
and fixation position. This standard holistic account is incorporated in dominant eye movement models of eye movement
control in reading (e.g. E-Z Reader, Reichle et al., 2009; and
SWIFT, Engbert et al., 2005).
Alternatively, word identification may not utilize visual information holistically, especially in natural reading. Unlike in
isolated word identification where information about a word
comes only from visual input obtained by directly fixating
it, in natural reading information about a word comes from
more sources. These include contextual information from the
preceding text and visual information obtained from fixations
close to but not on the current word, which may still yield
some visual preview of the word’s initial letters. As a result,
the most efficient positions from which to obtain useful new
visual information about the word can vary from trial to trial,
dependent on the information already obtained. Even in such
an account, it is still possible that, on average, the most efficient positions are located near the center (as has been found
in prior work). This account of word identification is implemented in rational models, which consider reading as a process of combining information from various sources to identify words and making eye movement decisions to maximize
identification efficiency (Bicknell & Levy, 2010, 2012; Legge
et al., 1997, 2002). For example, if a reader in this framework
is working to identify a particular word, considering all the information that has already been gathered, there may be parts
of the word that the reader has already identified relatively
well and parts that are still relatively uncertain. It is intuitive
in such a situation that identification efficiency will be maximized by moving the eyes next to the part of the word about
which the reader is still relatively uncertain. This is because
such fixations would obtain fine-grained visual information
of a particular part of the word, which can be combined with
visual information obtained from previous fixations (as well
as linguistic contextual information), and identify the word in
a constructive manner. Thus, contrary to the holistic account’s
view that any fixation landing on a non-central position slows
identification efficiency relative to a central fixation, the view
from rational models is that the position in the word to move
the eyes next to maximize identification efficiency will vary
from trial to trial and depend on information already obtained.
A phenomenon that can be used to tease apart these two accounts is that of refixations, cases in which a word is fixated
more than once during first-pass reading. The goal of an in-

The standard model is that word identification in reading is
a holistic process, most efficient when words are centered in
the visual field. In contrast, rational models of reading predict
word identification to be a constructive process, where readers
efficiently gather visual information about a word, and may
combine visual information about different parts of the word
obtained across multiple fixations to identify it. We tease apart
these accounts by arguing that rational models should predict
that the most efficient place in a word to make a second fixation (refixation) depends on the visual information the reader
has already obtained. We present evidence supporting this prediction from an eye movement corpus. Computational model
simulations confirm that a rational model predicts this finding, but a model implementing holistic identification does not.
These results suggest that refixations can be well understood
as rationally gathering visual information, and that word identification works constructively.

Introduction
Reading is a complex information processing task with a goal
usually related to comprehending the text. In general, accurate text comprehension requires the identification of many
(if not most) of the words in a text. It is not surprising, then,
that decades of research on eye movements in reading have
established that word identification can be seen as the primary driver of eye movements (Rayner, 1998). A substantial
body of work has studied the role in this process of many
information sources relevant to word identification in reading, including especially word frequency and in-context predictability, among others. However, although visual information is the primary source of information used to ultimately
identify a word, the fundamental way in which visual information is used in word identification remains unresolved.
In the standard model of word identification in reading,
word identification is hypothesized to be a holistic process,
during which visual information about the word as a whole
constrains the efficiency of identification. Eye movement
studies have shown that a word presented in isolation is most
rapidly identified when fixating approximately at its center
(O’Regan, 1990, 1992). It has also been found in natural reading that the fixation position that minimizes gaze duration (the
total amount of time spent fixating a word in first pass) and refixation probability (the probability of making more than one
fixation on a word in first pass) is on average at or slightly left
of the center (Rayner, Sereno, & Raney, 1996). One explanation for these results is that when the word center is directly
fixated, the largest possible part of the word falls in the central
high-acuity portion of the visual field (the fovea), yielding the
highest-quality visual input of the whole word; as the fixation
deviates from the center, more letters of the word fall out of

301

tended refixation is assumed to be moving the eyes to a position that will maximize identification efficiency of the current
word. Despite previous experiments showing that refixation
rate varied on average as a quadratic function of the distance
between word center and the fixation position (McConkie,
Kerr, Reddix, Zola, & Jacobs, 1989) and was influenced by
linguistic properties such as word frequency (Rayner et al.,
1996), few studies shed light on where refixations go. The two
accounts of word identification make different predictions for
this question. The rational model predicts that refixations target the part of the word about which sufficient information
has not yet been obtained. Which part of the word this is depends on the visual information already available.1 In contrast, the standard model of word identification predicts that
refixations should always target the center to maximize the
holistic visual processing efficiency of the word, independent
of information obtained about different parts of the word.
Naively, then, we could tease apart these two hypotheses
by analyzing the relationship between the position of the initial fixation on a word (the ‘landing position’) and the refixation position. The rational account would predict that if the
landing position is at the beginning of the word, a refixation
should be at the end, and vice versa, whereas the standard
model would predict that all refixations cluster around the
center, regardless of the landing position. Empirically, this
prediction of the rational models is borne out (Rayner et al.,
1996), but the standard model explains this phenomenon in
a different way. Specifically, there is a concept of systematic
error (McConkie et al., 1988), which suggests that intended
saccade sizes become biased toward the overall average saccade size. This means that refixation saccades intended to be
short and target the center of the word in the standard model
will tend to overshoot their target, landing on the opposite end
of the word. Thus, both the standard model combined with
systematic error and the rational model predict the effect of
landing position on where refixations go.
Analyzing where refixations go as a function of the location of the previous fixation made before fixating a word (the
‘launch site’), however, can tease apart these two accounts,
when controlling for effects of landing site. If a reader’s first
eye movement to the word is launched from a position close
to the word, then more visual information about the word’s
beginning should be available (relative to the launch site being further away), holding constant the landing site. Therefore, rational models predict that for closer launch sites, a
refixation should be less likely to move the eyes back toward
the beginning of the word (Fig. 1, right panel). In contrast, the
standard model would not predict such an effect, but predict
that an intentional refixation that follows a fixation on the left
half of a word should always go forward, while one that follows a fixation on the right half should always go backward,
always targeting the word center (Fig. 1, left panel).

Figure 1: The standard model and the rational model make
different predictions for where refixations go. For the standard model, refixations always target the center of the word,
regardless of launch site. For the rational model, refixations
target positions where character identity has low confidence
(here represented by hypothetical m( j) values). Therefore,
closer launch sites, which provide more visual information
about the word’s initial letters (schematically represented
here by grey rectangle) predict refixations are more likely to
move forward. The refixation decisions here are based on eye
movement policy parameters of α = .9 and β = .7. (See Eye
movement policy section for more details.)
In this paper, we empirically evaluate these two competing predictions by performing a statistical analysis of where
refixations go in a large eye movement corpus, and we compare these results to simulations from computational models
of both accounts. In the next section, we report the results of
our statistical analysis of human refixation data, showing that
it is as predicted by the rational account. We then confirm
that an eye movement model that implements the standard
model cannot accommodate this finding by performing simulations with E-Z Reader (Reichle et al., 2009). After that, we
describe our rational model of refixations. Finally, we confirm
that simulations using it show the same qualitative pattern as
the human data, and then conclude.

Experiment 1: Human data in Dundee corpus
This analysis aims to tease apart the predictions of the rational model and the standard model on where refixations go.
Specifically, we use the English part of the Dundee corpus
(Kennedy, 2003) of eye movements during natural reading,
and analyze the direction of refixation as a function of launch
site, statistically controlling for landing site.

Methods
Data The English part of the Dundee corpus contained eye
movement records from 10 native English-speaking participants as they read through newspaper editorials (see Kennedy
& Pynte, 2005 for further details.) We first did a set of screening procedures, according to criteria that are generally applied to eye movement data, to remove fixations involving
blinks, non-first-pass fixations, and the first/last two fixations

ignore contextual information for simplicity.

of the line. After this procedure, the corpus contained 23,854
fixations that were followed by a refixation during first-pass
reading (18.9% of first-pass fixations). These data then underwent screening procedures excluding: (a) extremely far
launch sites (1%), leaving the launch sites of fixations in the
range [−16, −1] (in terms of number of characters from word
beginning); (b) fixations that landed on the space right before
the word (25.5%) or on the last character of the word (4.7%)
to ensure the variability of refixation directions; and (c) fixations on words of which the previous word was skipped
to eliminate possible overshootings of the previous word
(20.9%), since these can be followed by corrective saccades.
In the end, the data consisted of 7,667 fixations.

Launch site

Statistical analysis A logistic generalized linear mixedeffects model (GLMM) was used to analyze the direction
of refixations (forward vs. backward). Fixed effects included
launch site and combinations of word length and landing site,
which controlled for arbitrary effects of word length and landing site on refixation direction. Random effects included a
random intercept and slope of launch site by subjects. Significance testing was via likelihood ratio test. All statistical analyses were implemented in the R environment, using the glmer
function from the lme4 package (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, &
Walker, 2015) for GLMM implementation. In order to ensure
model convergence, word length–landing site pairs for which
all refixations (or all but 1) moved in the same direction were
excluded, leaving 6714 fixations (87.6%).

dard holistic model of word identification, and always targets
refixations to the center of words. In principle, then, all intentional refixations following a fixation on the left half of
the word should move forward and those following a fixation
on the right half should move backward. Simulations with an
implemented version of this model help to ensure that unintentional refixations – saccades intended for another word
that happen to become a refixation due to motor error – do
not in general change these predictions.

Results and discussion
Fig. 2 shows the effect of launch site on the probability
that refixations move forward for each word length–landing
site pair. The GLMM showed that nearer launch sites predicted significantly more forward refixations, βˆ = 0.15, SE =
0.03, χ21 = 13.98, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI)
= [0.10, 0.20]. As reported in the following section, the standard model can accommodate this effect only for landing sites
on the right half of the word. To see whether this was also
true of the human data, separate analyses were carried out for
fixations with landing sites on the left and the right half of
the word. For the left half (4790 fixations), launch site predicted more forward refixations, βˆ = 0.16, SE = 0.03, χ21 =
10.91, p < 0.001, 95%CI = [0.09, 0.22], and the same was
true for the right half (1362 fixations), βˆ = 0.14, SE = 0.04,
χ21 = 7.40, p < 0.01, 95%CI = [0.05, 0.22]. These observations that closer launch sites predicted more forward-moving
refixations confirm the rational model’s predictions. The separate analyses of fixations on the left and right halves of the
word indicated that this effect generalized across both.

Methods
Data We used E-Z Reader 10 (Reichle et al., 2009) to generate eye movement data for 100,000 virtual readers reading sentences from the Schilling corpus (Schilling, Rayner, &
Chumbley, 1998) of single English sentences typical of reading experiments. Each virtual reader was a simulation completed using a Monte Carlo run of the model.
The data cleansing procedure was the same as that in
Expt. 1. Out of the 20,189,603 first-pass fixations, 3,417,999
(16.9%) of them were followed by a refixation. Excluding extreme launch sites, fixations landing on initial or final letters
of a word, and skipping of the previous word left 1,029,801
fixations. Launch site ranged between [−15, −1].
Statistical analysis A generalized linear model (GLM)
with the same fixed effects as that in Expt. 1 was adopted
to analyze the effect of launch sites on refixation direction.
Random effects were removed from the GLMM used for
Expt. 1 since the virtual readers were simply different Monte
Carlo runs with no systematic differences. Excluding word
length–landing position pairs where all refixations (or all but
1) moved in the same direction left 899,838 fixations (87.4%).

Experiment 2: E-Z Reader
This section aims to show that the standard model does not
predict the effect of launch site on direction of refixations.
To this end, we carry out the same analyses as the previous
section on simulation data from E-Z Reader, a computational
model of eye movements in reading that incorporates the stan-

Results and discussion
Fig. 3 shows the effect of launch site on the probability for
refixations moving forward. The GLM showed that nearer

303

launch site predicted significantly more forward refixations,
βˆ = 0.08, SE = 0.004, χ21 = 386.66, p < 0.001, 95%CI =
[0.07, 0.09]. However, this effect was driven by fixations landing on the right half of the word, βˆ = 0.10, SE = 0.004,
χ21 = 542.99, p < 0.001, 95%CI = [0.09, 0.11], while fixations landing on the left half had 99% refixations moving forward and yielded an opposite effect, βˆ = −0.33, SE = 0.03,
χ21 = 147.37, p < 0.001, 95%CI = [−0.39, −0.27].
Therefore, E-Z Reader does not in general predict that
closer launch sites should lead to refixations being more
likely to go forward, contrary to our observations on the human data, although it can accommodate such a prediction for
fixations on the right half of the word. Although this effect
on the right half of the word may seem surprising, we note
that the predictions we described above for this account only
hold for intentional refixations. We believe that this effect on
refixations on the right half of the word arises from unintentional refixations. Specifically, for a fixation position on the
right half of a word, the E-Z Reader model will generally execute one of two behaviors: initiating a saccade to refixate the
word or initiating a saccade to move on to the next word. In
this case, an intended refixation will target a leftward position (since the center of the word is to the left of fixation)
and an intended saccade to the next word will target a rightward position. Which of these two behaviors occurs depends
on how quickly the identification (or more technically, L1 ) is
completed for the current word. Closer launch sites mean that
identification of the word will be completed more quickly,
which in turn will lead to a greater chance of making a forward saccade intended for the next word. Assuming some of
these forward saccades become unintentional forward refixations, this creates exactly the predicted relationship between
launch site and refixation direction. For the present purposes,
however, the main conclusion here is that the standard model
cannot reproduce a general effect of launch site on refixation
direction.

its language model is combined with a likelihood term given
by ‘noisy’ visual input at the position of fixation to form a
posterior distribution over the identity of the text given all
information sources. Formalized with Bayes’ theorem,
p(w|I) ∝ p(w)p(I|w)

(1)

where the probability of the true identity of the word being
w given uncertain visual input I is calculated by multiplying
the language model prior p(w) with the likelihood p(I|w) of
obtaining this visual input from word w, and normalizing.
In general, the prior p(w) represents reader expectations
for words conditioned on the context, but for the present paper, we ignore context and use only a word frequency model
for simplicity. The visual likelihood is computed similarly to
in Bicknell and Levy (2010): each letter is represented as a
26-dimensional vector with a single element being 1 and the
rest being 0s. Visual input about each letter is accumulated iteratively over time by sampling from a multivariate Gaussian
distribution centered on that letter with a diagonal covariance
matrix Σ = λ−1 I, where λ is the reader’s visual acuity for that
letter. Visual acuity depends on the location of the letter in
relation to the point of fixation, which is a function of the letter’s eccentricity ε. In our model, we assumed that acuity is a
symmetric, exponential function of eccentricity:

Rational models of reading
In this section, we describe an implemented rational model
of refixations, which we will use in the next section to confirm that the intuitively-derived predictions of the rational account for the relationship between launch site and refixations
are actually produced by an implemented rational model. Rational models of reading use Bayesian inference to combine
visual information with language knowledge (e.g., contextual
information). Based on the posterior distribution, eye movements are selected to maximize identification efficiency. The
rational model of refixations we describe in this paper also
follows this idea, and can be viewed as an application of the
more general-purpose rational models of eye movements in
reading to the specific situation of refixations. This section
introduces the framework of our model.

σL = 3.74 for the right visual field) used in Bicknell and Levy
(2010). In order to scale the quality of visual information, we
multiply each acuity λ by the overall visual input quality Λ,
which is set to 12 in our simulation (see Expt. 3 below).

Word identification as Bayesian inference
Word identification consists of Bayesian inference, in which a
prior distribution over possible identities of the text given by

prediction that we derived from it intuitively: that refixations
would be more likely to move forward for closer launch sites.
As described in the previous section, the rational model of
refixations we use combines information from previous fixations (including the launch site) to form a posterior distribution on the identity of a word through Bayesian inference.
It then makes refixation eye movements to parts of the word
about which it is uncertain.

Based on the posterior distribution on possible identities of
the word, eye movement decisions are selected to maximize
reading efficiency. For example, the first rational model of
reading, Mr. Chips, used this optimizing principle: the model
reads input text sequentially, without error, in the minimum
number of saccades (Legge et al., 1997, 2002). Specifically,
saccades were made to minimize the expected entropy of the
current word after the next fixation.
In a more recent rational model of eye movements in reading (Bicknell & Levy, 2010, 2012), eye movement decisions
depend on the uncertainty of the posterior distribution about
each letter position. Specifically, given a fixation landing on
an unknown character c in position j, the marginal probability
m of the most likely character under the posterior is
m( j) = max p(w j = c)
c

Methods
Model parameters For the language model component of
the word identification model (the prior), we used word frequency information (a unigram model) from the Corpus of
Contemporary American English (COCA) (Davies, 2016).
For this simulation, we did not optimize the behavior policy parameters to maximize reading efficiency as in Bicknell
and Levy (2010), but set them manually to what we surmised
might be reasonable values of α = 0.9 and β = 0.7. Future
work will optimize them, but we do not expect the qualitative
predictions relevant to this analysis to change.

where w j indicates the character in position j. A high value of
m( j) indicates relative confidence about the character’s identity, and a low value relative uncertainty. The model then decided between four possible actions based on m( j): continuing to fixate the current landing position, moving backward,
moving forward, and ending the reading process.
We use a similar eye movement policy in our refixation
model. If the value of the aforementioned statistic m( j) is less
than a parameter α, the model chooses to continue fixating the
current position. Otherwise, if the value of m( j) is less than
the parameter β for some leftward position, the model initiates a saccade to the closest such position. If no such positions
exist to the left, then the model initiates a saccade to the closest position to the right for which m( j) < α. Once a refixation
is executed, the simulation ends. If all m( j) values to the right
(left) are above α (β), we decide this word is identified with
a satisfactory uncertainty level, and the identification of this
word ends. In such a situation, we expect that the eyes move
to the next word, which is beyond the current paper’s scope
of studying refixations.
The actual landing position is the intended fixation position with random motor error: the actual landing position `i
is sampled from a Gaussian centered on the intended target
ti with standard deviation given by a linear function of the
intended saccade distance
`i ∼ N (ti , (σ0 + σ1 |ti − `i−1 |)2 )

Data Eye movement data were generated to identify a
word. All words were in the most frequent 5,000 words in
COCA, and word lengths ranged between [3, 10]. Launch site
had a range of [−10, −1]. For each word length, each possible landing position, and each launch site, 200 trials were
run to model the word identification process as when a fixation landed on that landing position, preceded by a fixation on
that launch site. In each trial, a word was randomly selected
uniformly from words with the same length.
Procedure Each trial began with a fixation with a duration
of 200 time steps on the launch site, in order to represent the
visual information obtained prior to fixating the word. Then,
the fixation at the landing site began. On each timestep of that
fixation, visual information was obtained and integrated with
prior information to update the posterior, and then a behavior decision was made: whether to continue fixating, make a
refixation, or stop reading (see model description).
Statistical analysis A GLM with the same fixed effects as
that in Expt. 2 was adopted to analyze the effect of launch
site on refixation direction. Excluding word length–landing
position pairs where all refixations (or all but 1) moved in the
same direction left 25,636 fixations.

(soon) turns to it.
While it’s possible that such eye movement models could
be constructed while maintaining the standard model of word
identification, our findings are completely consistent with the
predictions of rational models of reading, and suggest that
these models should be more fully explored. Here, we focused specifically on how visual information already obtained
about a word influences where refixations should go, but rational models predict that the interaction of visual and linguistic information is what should ultimately matter. Future
work should test these more complex predictions.

General discussion
In this paper, we investigated how visual information is used
for word identification during natural reading. We compared
two accounts: (1) the standard holistic model, in which visual
information about the word as a whole is used in word identification, and processing is always most efficient from the
center; and (2) a rational model, in which readers combine
information from many sources to identify a word constructively, and the fixation location that maximizes identification
efficiency depends on what prior information has been obtained. We suggested that these two models make divergent
predictions for the possible effects of launch site on where
refixations go. Specifically, only the rational model should
predict that refixations are more likely to go rightward for
closer launch sites. An analysis of a large human eye movement corpus confirmed that this prediction of the rational account holds in human data. Model simulations confirmed that
a rational model does indeed predict it, and that at least one
of the implementations of the standard model (E-Z Reader)
could not accommodate this finding.
These findings seem strongly inconsistent with models in
which all intentional refixations target the center of a word,
which in turn suggests that the standard holistic model of
word identification in reading may be incorrect. However, it
is possible to imagine that other refixation targeting schemes
could be used even if the holistic model of word identification in reading is correct. For example, even under the standard model, it might be a useful strategy to target a refixation further forward in a word when that word is closer to
being identified. Even if there is an efficiency penalty for being away from the center while that word is finished being
identified, that penalty might be outweighed by the benefits
of being closer to the next word when the reader’s attention
