tended refixation is assumed to be moving the eyes to a posi-

word. Despite previous experiments showing that refixation
rate varied on average as a quadratic function of the distance
between word center and the fixation position (McConkie,
Kerr, Reddix, Zola, & Jacobs, 1989) and was influenced by
linguistic properties such as word frequency (Rayner et al.,
1996), few studies shed light on where refixations go. The two
accounts of word identification make different predictions for
this question. The rational model predicts that refixations tar-
