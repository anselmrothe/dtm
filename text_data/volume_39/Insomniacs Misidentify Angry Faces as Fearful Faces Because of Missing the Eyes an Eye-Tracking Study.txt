23 individuals with insomnia symptoms and 23 non-
insomniac controls classified by the Sleep Condition
Indicator (SCI, Espie et al., 2014) were recruited (Table 1).
The SCI consists of 8 items concerning an individual’s sleep
condition during the recent month in a 0-4 Likert-style
scale. The Chinese SCI has been validated and
recommended as a screening tool for clinical insomnia with
an original cut-off at 21/22 (Wong et al., 2017). To increase
the contrast between the two groups, individuals with SCI
scores < 19 were classified as individuals with insomnia
symptoms, and those with SCI scores > 24 were classified
as non-insomnia controls. Participants in the two groups          Figure 1. (A) A demonstration of a trial with an angry face. (B)
