Dissolving the Grounding Problem: How the Pen is Mightier than the Sword
Nancy Salay

Abstract: The computational metaphor for mind is still the central guiding idea in cognitive science despite many insightful
and well-founded rejections of it. There is good reason for its staying power: when we are at our cognitive best, we reason
about our world with our concepts. But the challengers are right, I argue, in insisting that no reductive account of that capacity
is forthcoming. Here I describe an externalist account that grounds representations in organism-level engagement with its
environment, not in its neural activity.
