between one card with three pictures depicting the story in
order from left-to-right (LR; see Table 1 and Fig 1A) and
another with the same 3 pictures ordered from right-to-left
(Fig. 1B). Participants in the Vertical condition chose
between cards with images arranged from top-to-bottom
(Fig 1C) vs. bottom-to-top (Fig 1D), and, in the Mixed
condition, between LR and TB lines (Fig. 1A vs. 1C). The
two cards were placed side-by-side in the Vertical and
Mixed conditions, but were positioned one above the other
in the Horizontal condition. Every child heard the Egg story
first. Half the children heard the remaining stories in the
order listed in Table 1, and half heard them in the reverse
order. The positioning of the two cards was counterbalanced
across subjects and items. Adults read the stories on a
computer, and clicked the image they thought was better.
