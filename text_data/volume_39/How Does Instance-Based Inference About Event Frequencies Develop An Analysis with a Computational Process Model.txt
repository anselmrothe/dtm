compared to 40% of adults). Only few participants were
best described by the guessing strategy. Overall, there was
greater uncertainty in the classification of children to latent
groups than in the classification of adults. This was partly
due to the lower number of instances children recalled
resulting in poorer discriminability between the models.
   Next, we compared children’s and adults’ search and
decision processes by evaluating their group-level SCM
parameter estimates. As shown in Figure 3, children and
adults weighted the different circles in their social network
similarly (although adults showed greater inter-individual
variability in the weighting of different circles), applied
similar decision thresholds, and did not differ on the
response noise parameter (for all parameters, 95% HDIs
overlapped). Children’s lower inferential accuracy was thus
not due to a more error prone execution of an instance-based
inference strategy. This also held for inferences described
by availability-by-recall.
                         Discussion
Our results suggest that already children systematically
exploit their instance knowledge to make inferences about
the frequency of events in the world. However, they do so
differently than adults. Whereas the judgments of most
adults were best described by a strategy that assumes limited
information search, the judgments of most children were
best accounted for by a strategy that assumes exhaustive
search. This finding echoes previous research on multi-                    Figure 3: Posterior distributions of the group-level
