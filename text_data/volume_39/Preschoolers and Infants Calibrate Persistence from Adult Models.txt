Abstract: Perseverance, above and beyond IQ, predicts academic outcomes in school age children, however, little is known
about what factors affect persistence in early childhood. Here, we propose a formal Bayesian model of how children might
learn how to calibrate effort from observing adult models and then explore this idea behaviorally across two experiments in
children and infants. Results from Experiment 1 show that preschoolers persist more after watching an adult persist, but only
if the adult is successful at reaching their goal. Experiment 2 and a pre-registered replication extend these findings, showing
that even infants use adult models to modulate their persistence, and can generalize this inference to novel situations. These
results suggest that both preschoolers and infants are sensitive to adult persistence and use it to calibrate their own effort in
far-reaching ways.
