Abstract
We study abductive, causal, and non-causal conditionals in
indicative and counterfactual formulations using probabilistic truth table tasks under incomplete probabilistic knowledge
(N = 80). We frame the task as a probability-logical inference
problem. The most frequently observed response type across
all conditions was a class of conditional event interpretations
of conditionals; it was followed by conjunction interpretations. An interesting minority of participants neglected some
of the relevant imprecision involved in the premises when inferring lower or upper probability bounds on the target conditional/counterfactual (“halfway responses”). We discuss the
results in the light of coherence-based probability logic and the
new paradigm psychology of reasoning.

Introduction
The probabilistic truth table task was introduced by two independent studies at the beginning of this millennium (Evans,
Handley, & Over, 2003; Oberauer & Wilhelm, 2003). It
serves to investigate how people interpret conditionals under
uncertainty. Moreover, it is one of the starting points of the
new (probability-based) paradigm psychology of reasoning
(see, e.g. Baratgin, Over, & Politzer, 2014; Elqayam, Bonnefon, & Over, 2016; Oaksford & Chater, 2007; Over, 2009;
Pfeifer, 2013; Pfeifer & Douven, 2014), which started to replace the old (classical logic-based) paradigm psychology of
reasoning. The probabilistic truth table task was constructed
to investigate how people interpret conditionals (i.e., indicative sentences of the form If A, then C). As its name suggests,
the task consists of inferring the degree of belief in a conditional based on probabilistic information attached to the truth
table cases. What are truth table cases? Let A and C denote
two propositions (i.e., sentences for which it makes sense to
assign the truth values true or false) like a fair die is rolled
and the side of the die shows an even number, respectively.
The four truth table cases induced by A and C are: A ∧ C,
A ∧ ¬C, ¬A ∧ C, and ¬A ∧ ¬C, where ∧ denotes conjunction
(“and”) and ¬ denotes negation. Classical logic is bivalent,
involving only the truth values true and false. Therefore, the
conditional defined in classical logic (i.e., the material conditional, see Table 1) is either true or false. The conditional
event C|A involved in conditional probability (p(C|A)), however, is not bivalent, as it is void (or undetermined) if its antecedent A is false (see Table 1). Therefore, it cannot be represented by the means of classical logic.

Table 1 presents the truth conditions of the most important psychological interpretations for adult reasoning about
indicative conditionals (i.e., conditional event, conjunction,
and material conditional). Moreover, it presents the biconditional and biconditional event interpretations, which were reported in developmental psychological studies (see, e.g. Barrouillet, Gauffroy, & Lecas, 2015).
Psychological evidence for the conditional event interpretation was already observed within the old paradigm psychology of reasoning (see, e.g., Wason & Johnson-Laird, 1972).
The response pattern, which is consistent with the conditional
event interpretation was seen as irrational (dubbed “defective
truth table”), as it violates the semantics of the material conditional. The material conditional used to be the gold standard
of reference for the meaning of indicative conditionals in the
old paradigm. However, within the new paradigm psychology of reasoning this response pattern is, of course, perfectly
rational (Over & Baratgin, 2017; Pfeifer & Tulkki, 2017).

While classical truth table tasks require to respond with
truth values, probabilistic truth table tasks require to with
respond degrees of belief. Following Pfeifer (2013), we interpret the task as a probability logical inference problem.
Specifically, it is formalised as a probability logical argument
with assigned degrees of belief in the four truth table cases
as its premises and the degree of belief in a conditional as its
conclusion. The inference problem consists in propagating
the uncertainties of the premises to the conclusion. As an example, consider the conditional probability interpretation of
the (p(C|A)) conditional If A, then C as the conclusion. This
argument scheme is formalised by:
(A ) From p(A ∧C) = x1 , p(A ∧ ¬C) = x2 , p(¬A ∧C) = x3 ,
and p(¬A ∧ ¬C) = x4 , infer p(C|A) = x1 /(x1 + x2 ).
In argument scheme (A ), the fraction x1 /(x1 + x2 ) is the prob-

ability propagation rule for the conditional probability. For
different interpretations of the conditional, the probability
propagation rules differ. Table 2 presents the corresponding
probability propagation rules of the interpretations given in
Table 1.

x1 , p(A ∧ ¬C) = x2 , p(¬A ∧ C) = x3 , p(¬A ∧ ¬C) = x4 } entails the respective conclusion (see also Table 1).

p(A ∧C) = x1
p(A ≡ C) = x1 + x4
p(C||A) = x1 /(x1 + x2 + x3 )
p(C|A) = x1 /(x1 + x2 )

The main empirical result of classical probabilistic truth
table tasks is that the dominant responses are consistent with
the conditional event interpretation of conditionals. Moreover, if people solve the task several times, some people shift
to the conditional event interpretation during the course of the
experiment (see, e.g., Fugard, Pfeifer, Mayerhofer, & Kleiter,
2011a; Pfeifer & Stöckle-Schobel, 2015).
A key feature of classical probabilistic truth table tasks
is that they present complete probabilistic knowledge w.r.t.
the truth table cases: all (point-valued) probabilities x1 , . . . x4
are available to the participant (see, e.g., Evans et al., 2003;
Oberauer & Wilhelm, 2003; Fugard et al., 2011a; Pfeifer
& Stöckle-Schobel, 2015). When all probabilities involved
in argument scheme (A ) are given as point values, for example, it is possible to infer a precise (point-valued) probability of C|A. Of course, x3 and x4 are irrelevant for calculating p(C|A) in this case. However, as full probabilistic
information is usually not available in everyday life, we argue for investigating incomplete probabilistic knowledge. If
x1 in argument scheme (A ) is only available as an imprecise
(i.e., interval-valued) probability, i.e., x1′ ≤ p(A ∧C) ≤ x1′′ , the
probability of the conclusion of (A ) is also imprecise, i.e.,
x1′ /(x1′ + x2 ) ≤ p(C|A) ≤ x1′′ /(x1′′ + x2 ). Table 4 (see below)
presents a numerical illustration of the different interpretations of conditionals in the probabilistic truth table task with
imprecise premises. Incomplete probabilistic knowledge has
not been investigated within the probabilistic truth table task
paradigm yet (for an exception, where only indicative conditionals were investigated, see Pfeifer, 2013).
With only a few exceptions (i.e., Over, Hadjichristidis,
Evans, Handley, & Sloman, 2007; Pfeifer & Stöckle-Schobel,
2015), the important classes of causal conditionals and counterfactuals have not been investigated empirically within the
probabilistic truth table task paradigm yet. Causal conditionals are characterized by connecting cause (i.e., the conditional’s antecedent) and effect (i.e., the conditional’s consequent), like If you take aspirin, your headache will disappear.

Counterfactuals are conditionals in subjunctive mood, where
the grammatical structure signals that the antecedent is false.
For instance, If you were to take aspirin (A), your headache
would disappear (D), which signals that you had not taken
aspirin yet (¬A). This example is a counterfactual version of
the above described causal conditional. Of course, there are
also non-causal versions of counterfactuals, like If the side of
a card were to show an ace, it would show spades.
Traditionally, counterfactuals are interpreted by possible
world semantics (most prominently by Lewis and Stalnaker).
However, we interpret counterfactuals in terms of coherence
based probability logic. In a nutshell, the aforementioned
example of a (causal) counterfactual can by interpreted by
a (right-)nested conditional, where the antecedent represents
the factual statement ¬A and the consequent represents the
conditional D|A. This representation amounts to (D|A)|¬A,
which is a conditional random quantity (because of the pagelimit we refer for the technical details to Gilio & Sanfilippo,
2013, 2014; Gilio, Over, Pfeifer, & Sanfilippo, 2017, submitted). It can be proved that the degree of belief in the conditional random quantity (D|A)|¬A is also equal to p(D|A)
(i.e., Prevision((D|A)|¬A) = p(D|A); see Gilio & Sanfilippo,
2013, Example 1, p. 225). Therefore, we hypothesize that the
participants’ degrees of belief in counterfactuals are equal to
corresponding conditional probabilities.
Note that the conditional random quantity (C|A)|¬A does
not coincide with C|(A ∧ ¬A), because the Import-Export
Principle does not hold (Gilio & Sanfilippo, 2014). Therefore, as shown by Gilio and Sanfilippo (2014), the counterintuitive consequences of the well-known triviality results
(Lewis, 1976) are avoided. By the way, the formula C|(A ∧
¬A) is unintelligible (in terms of the Ramsey test, you cannot
add a contradiction to your stock of beliefs).
To our knowledge, abductive conditionals have not been
empirically investigated in the probabilistic truth table task
paradigm yet. Abductive conditionals can be conceived as
reversed causal conditionals, characterized as follows: the effect is located in the conditional’s antecedent and the cause
is located in the conditional’s consequent. For example, If
your headache disappeared, then you took aspirin. Abductive inferences are also known as inferences to the best explanation (for philosophical and psychological overviews on
abduction see, e.g., Douven, 2016a; Lombrozo, 2012, respectively). Like indicative and causal conditionals, abductive
conditionals can be formulated in indicative and in subjunctive mood.
The aim of the present study is to help to fill the above
mentioned research gaps. Specifically, we aim to shed light
on the following questions using probabilistic truth table tasks
under incomplete probabilistic knowledge: Are there reasoning strategies for inferring lower and upper bounds in the
context of incomplete probabilistic knowledge? Is the conditional event interpretation dominant for abductive, causal,
and non-causal counterfactuals?

Method
Materials and Design The task material consisted of 18
pen and paper tasks, preceded by 4 examples explaining the
answer format. The task sequence consisted of 9 different
tasks that were presented twice in the same random order (i.e.,
task T10 is a repetition of task T1), resulting in the total of 18
tasks. The tasks were designed to test how participants infer
about uncertain conditional sentences in four different experimental conditions (see Table 3). All conditions had the same
task sequence, with the following variations: For the first
two conditions we used a non-causal scenario in both indicative and counterfactual moods. For the other two conditions
we used two variations of a causal scenario in counterfactual
mood; inference from causes to effects (causal) and inference
from effects to causes (abductive). The material was adapted
from probabilistic truth table tasks, which involved precise
premises (Fugard et al., 2011a; Pfeifer & Stöckle-Schobel,
2015).

For the non-causal scenario we used a vignette story about
a six-sided die. The story describes that the die was randomly
thrown so that the participants did not know which of the
sides ended up facing upwards. The sides of the die were
illustrated as six squares. Each side had an image of a black
or white geometric figure. In tasks T1, T2, T10, and T11 all
sides of the die were shown. To introduce incomplete probabilistic knowledge we presented “covered” sides in the rest of
the tasks. Covered sides were indicated by a question mark.
Here is an example of how we presented the six sides of a die
(task T3/T12):
(Die sides)

It was explained in the introduction to give point valued responses by marking the same numbers in both response boxes
(i.e., lower and upper bounds coincide).
The target sentence in the non-causal tasks was formulated
in terms of “If A, then C”. In all non-causal tasks the antecedent mentioned a form and the consequent mentioned a
color. After completing each task, the participants were asked
to rate their confidence in the correctness of their response on
a 10-step rating scale from “fully confident that your answer
is incorrect” to “fully confident that your answer is correct”.
Apart from the following two differences, the counterfactual task version was identical to the indicative version of
the task: (i) we added a factual statement which contradicted
the antecedent of the target sentence and (ii) the target sentence was formulated in subjunctive mood. “The form of an
upward-facing side of the die is a cube” is an example of a
factual statement and the corresponding target sentence is:
“if the figure on the upward facing side of the die were a circle, then the figure would be black” (Jos ylöspäin osoittavan
kyljen kuvio olisi ympyrä, niin tämä kuvio olisi musta). The
suffix -isi in the Finnish original indicates the counterfactual
mood.
For the causal and abductive conditions, the tasks were
structurally identical to the (non-causal) dice-scenario. However, instead of dice, a vignette story about drugs and their
effects created a causal scenario. In the vignette story, six
patient reports were shown to the participants. The patient reports were illustrated as six rectangles having a name of a fictional drug and a result of the medication (either “diminishes
symptoms” or “no impact on the symptoms”). We used question marks on some patient reports (like in the dice scenario)
to introduce incomplete probabilistic knowledge. Here is an
example of the patient reports, which contains the same probabilistic information as the above mentioned die-example:

?

Next, the participants were presented with the question
“How sure can you be that the following sentence holds?”
(Kuinka varma voit olla siitä, että seuraava lause pitää
paikkaansa?). The target sentences were highlighted with a
frame to make the scope of the question clear, for example:
If the figure on the upward facing side of the die is a circle,
then the figure is black.

The answer format had two sets of tick boxes in a “x out of y”
format for responding interval-valued degrees of belief. The
two response boxes were labeled accordingly (“at least” and
“at most”); for instance, as follows:

In the causal version of the task material the antecedent
denotes the name of a drug and the consequent denotes an effect. In the abductive version the order was reversed: first an
effect was presented and then a drug was named. In this way
the tasks called for either causal inferences from causes to effects, or abductive inferences from effects to causes. As the
material was formulated in counterfactual mood, we added
a factual statement to each task, which contradicted the antecedent of the target sentence.
Participants and Procedure Eighty students from the University of Helsinki (Finland) participated in the experiment.

2890

The students were native Finnish speakers with no previous
academic training in logic or probability. Each participant
was tested individually. The paper and pencil tasks were followed by a short structured interview about how the participants had interpreted the target tasks. Participants were paid
15¤ for their participation.

Results and Discussion
We performed Fisher’s exact tests to investigate whether the
four different versions of the task booklets had an impact on
the participants’ degrees of belief in the respective target sentences. After p-value corrections for multiple significance
tests, we did not observe significant differences between the
four conditions and we therefore pooled the data.
Table 5 shows the percentages of responses according to
the different interpretations of conditionals. All tasks differentiate between the conditional probability, the conjunction,
and the material conditional interpretation. A subset of the
tasks differentiates between biconditional and biconditional
event interpretations as well. Conditional probability interpretations marked with indices, however, were patterns identified from the data and were not anticipated during the construction of the task material. Therefore, not all tasks differentiate among all interpretations. Table 4 shows the normative answers for each interpretation for the example task discussed in the previous section (see (Die sides)). Both, lower
and upper bound responses, had to match the normative lower
and upper bounds for the categorization of the responses in
Table 5. Since each response box enables 42 different “X
out of Y ” responses, and since both, lower and upper bound
responses needed to match for the classification, the a priori chance for guessing an interpretation was very low (i.e.,
1/(422 ) = 0.0006).

The task material was designed so that the normative predictions of the three main psychological interpretations of

premises). The index l (resp., u) denotes conditional probability responses where the covered sides are ignored for inferring the lower (resp., upper) bound response. These response
types are the “halfway lower” and “halfway upper” interpretations, respectively. lu denotes conditional probability responses where covered sides are ignored for inferring both

material conditional) were unique for each task. During the
analysis we identified three further response strategies related
to the conditional probability interpretation. In what we call
halfway lower interpretation (denoted by p(·|·)l ) the upper
bound is the same as in conditional probability, but the lower
bound response differs in that the covered sides (i.e., sides
marked with question mark) are ignored. Halfway upper interpretation (denoted by p(·|·)u ) is the same, but in reverse
order. In a halfway both interpretation the covered sides are
ignored for both bound responses. As these answer strategies are in a sense partial versions of the conditional probability interpretation, we combined their results with conditional probability answers into grouped conditional probability. Notice that the tasks T1,T2, T10 and T11 with full information (i.e., no question marks) have the same value for lower
and upper bound answers. Therefore the halfway responses
could not be distinguished from the conditional probability
answers in these tasks.
Of all 1440 responses, 32.1% were consistent with standard conditional event responses, 29.9% were consistent with
conjunction responses, and 0.2% were consistent with material conditional responses. Like the material conditional,
also the biconditional and the biconditional event response
frequencies play a neglectable rôle in the data (0%–3% in the
four tasks T3, T6, T12, T15 where these interpretations were
differentiated). The predominant response strategy in pointvalued tasks (T1, T2, T10 and T11) was consistent with the
conditional probability interpretation. In nine out of 14 tasks
with incomplete probabilistic information (i.e., tasks involv-

ing “covered” sides or patient reports) the predominant answer strategy was conjunction. We also observed shifts of
interpretation towards conditional probability: comparing the
first three tasks with incomplete information (i.e., T3–T5) to
the last three (i.e., T16–T18), the number of conditional probability answers increased from 19% to 30%, and conjunction

answers decreased from 35% to 27%. This replicates shifts of
interpretations reported in the literature (Fugard et al., 2011a;
Pfeifer, 2013).
However, when all the conditional probability response
types are grouped together, the resulting set of response
strategies is clearly the predominant one in all tasks. 51.5% of
all answers are consistent with the grouped conditional probability responses. 18.1% were “other” responses, that is, responses that did not fit the grouped conditional probability,
conjunction, biconditional, biconditional event, or material
conditional. Thus, in total 81.9% of the data can be modeled
by the investigated hypotheses concerning the interpretation
of conditionals.
Compared to a previous study that investigated non-causal
indicative conditionals under incomplete probabilistic information (Pfeifer, 2013, i.e., similar tasks as in condition C1),
our results show lower level of conditional event responses
(compared to the previous 65.6%), and higher levels of conjunction responses (compared to the previous 5.6%). The material conditional responses were similar (previously 0.3%).
Pfeifer and Stöckle-Schobel (2015) investigated conditionals under complete probabilistic knowledge and used similar
tasks as in our conditions C1, C2 and C3. These authors also
reported higher levels of conditional probability answers and
lower levels of conjunction responses, while material conditional responses were similarly low. The lower levels of conditional probability responses may be explained by the apparent higher complexity of the tasks used in the present experiment. The tasks are more complex (i) because of the combination of using counterfactuals as target sentences in three of
four conditions and (ii) because of imprecise probabilities in
the premises (i.e., incomplete probabilistic information).
The tendency to give answers that partially coincide with
conditional probability has also been found in a previous
study which tested non-causal cases in indicative mood with
similar task material as we used for condition C1 (Pfeifer,
2013). In that study our halfway lower-interpretation is referred to as “halfway conditional event strategy”. However,
in the present study we found two completely new strategies:
the halfway upper- and the halfway both-interpretation. The
halfway upper-interpretation is particularly interesting, as it
explains 12.8% of the total 1120 responses, slightly more than
the halfway lower response strategy (i.e., 11.6%). Halfway
conditional probability responses might unburden the working memory load by ignoring the covered sides (see also
Pfeifer, 2013).
Figure 1 shows the results of the confidence ratings. We
performed analyses of variance to investigate impacts of the
different conditions. After Holm-Bonferroni corrections we
observed significant differences within the three tasks T1, T2
and T10. The corresponding p-values were 0.006, 0.01, and
0.008. In each of these tasks—as well as in all other tasks—
the condition C4 had lower mean confidence values compared
to the other conditions. The lower confidence may be because of the apparent higher difficulty of the task material in

2892

condition C4 for two reasons: first, the target sentence was
a counterfactual. Because of the inconsistency between the
factual statement and the antecedent, many participants reported counterfactuals as puzzling in the post-test interview.
Second, abductive tasks required “backward” inference from
effects to causes and are incongruent with the more natural if
cause, then effect-direction. In general, backward inferences
are known to be harder to draw compared to forward inferences (Evans & Beck, 1981).

Concluding Remarks
We investigated how people reason about conditionals under
incomplete probabilistic knowledge. The novel features in
our test design were comparisons of causal and abductive
scenarios, as well as counterfactuals under incomplete probabilistic knowledge. One of our main findings is that the dominant response is consistent with the conditional event interpretation of conditionals among all four groups. Moreover,
we discovered two major answer strategies, halfway upper
and halfway lower conditional event responses, which can
be understood as strategies to unburden the working memory
load.
Inferentialist accounts of conditionals propose that there
should be an inferential relation between the antecedent and
the consequent (see, e.g., Douven, 2016b). Thus, when conditionals with inferential relations (e.g., causal or abductive
ones) are compared with conditionals where no apparent inferential relation exists (like in our conditions C1 and C2),
one would expect significant differences. Our data, however,
do not support this inferentialist hypothesis.
The results of our paper broaden the area of inferences
where conditional probability seems to be the best predictor
for how people reason. We have shown that coherence-based
probability logic provides a formalization of the meaning of
counterfactuals and provides a rationality framework for reasoning under complete and incomplete probabilistic knowledge. This suggests that it may also be suitable for subclasses
of causal reasoning like abductive reasoning, which is important in the studies on (scientific) explanation and learning.
