best fill their personal knowledge gaps (Gureckis & Markant,
2012). Active control also supports learning by enhancing the
encoding of episodic representations which increases the like-
lihood of retrieving information about the experienced stim-
uli from memory (Markant, Ruggeri, Gureckis, & Xu, 2016).
Adult learners can benefit from even subtle control over tim-
ing by coordinating the presentation of new information with
their optimal attentional state so they are alert and ready to en-
code (Markant, DuBrow, Davachi, & Gureckis, 2014). More-
over, active control during memorization is associated with
increased coordination in the neural networks that support ex-
ecutive control, attention, and memory encoding (Markant et
al., 2016).
   A limitation to active learning is that benefits can vary
based on learners’ abilities and task demands. For example,
learners may be biased when sampling data, creating an un-
informative feedback loop. Markant (2016) manipulated the
hypothesis generation process in a series of category learning
tasks to assess the impact on adults’ ability to learn simple
and complex rules. Results showed successful active learn-             Figure 1: Examples of 1D trials varying by size dimension.
