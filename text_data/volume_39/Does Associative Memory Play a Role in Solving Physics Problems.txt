  The experiment followed a 2 (experience congruent/
incongruent with naïve physics theory) by 2 (carried/free-
moving object) within-subject design. The dependent
variable was participant response (straight down/curved
forwards). Each participant was presented with the same 12
basic physics problems, constructed using Microsoft Word
and Microsoft PowerPoint and programmed using SuperLab
software on a Macintosh computer. The experiment
contained what was essentially the same physics problem
presented in 12 different ways, using different contextual
features. All of the problems were framed around falling
objects travelling at the same speed. Six problems involved
carried objects and the other six problems involved free-
moving objects. These two types of problems were divided
into subcategories, based on whether the predicted answer
was congruent or incongruent with the naïve physics theory.
Therefore, the four categories of problems were: Carried –
Congruent (e.g. Figure 1), Carried – Incongruent (e.g.
Figure 2), Free-moving – Congruent (e.g. Figure 3) and
Free-Moving – Incongruent (e.g. Figure 4).
  There were three problems in each of the four categories.
Carried – Congruent: a seagull in flight dropping an ice-
cream, a plane dropping a crate and a running student
dropping a book; Carried – Incongruent: a swinging monkey
dropping a banana, a plane dropping a bouncing bomb and a
running cricketer dropping a ball; Free-Moving –
Congruent: a cannonball fired off a cliff, a skier approaching
a crevasse and a toy car falling off a table; Free-Moving
Incongruent: a river flowing off a cliff, a skater dropping
into a half-pipe and a toy train falling off a broken track.
The congruent problems were based on problems used in
previous research that resulted in responses congruent with
the naïve physics theory (i.e. straight down for carried
objects and curved forwards for free-moving objects). The
incongruent problems, which were designed to elicit
responses incongruent with the naive physics theory (i.e.
curved forwards for carried objects and straight down for
free-moving objects), were selected based on the research
team’s own visualisations of how the objects would appear
to behave from associated experiences (e.g. a skater can be
associated with dropping straight down into a half-pipe).
Procedure
Firstly, participants were given a consent form to sign,
which briefed them on the procedure of the experiment and
their right to withdraw at any time. They then read the
onscreen instructions as follows: “You are about to view a
series of scenarios in which objects are seen falling to the
ground. Firstly, look at the scenario and decide which path
you think the object will take on its journey, and then, from
the two choices offered, select which path you think most

pressing the corresponding number on the keyboard. For
example, if you think Path 1 is most similar to the path you

the falling object (see Figure 5). These were shown side by
side, with the object falling straight down or curved
forwards. Participants were asked to select the path they
thought was most likely. They were then asked to let the
experimenter know that they had made their decision. The
experimenter responded by asking a set list of questions
about the scenario: “What was happening in the scenario?”,
“Which answer did you select?” and “Why did you select
that answer?” The 12 scenarios were presented in random
order to prevent bias.

  As a first step, the data was analysed using a 4 (condition)
x 2 (response) contingency chi-square test to see if the
condition (carried-congruent, carried-incongruent, free-
congruent or free-incongruent) had a significant effect on
the responses given (straight down or curved forwards). A
contingency chi-square test was chosen because it
investigates whether there is a significant relationship
between two variables. A significance level of p = .05 was
used for all statistical tests. The results of the
analysis, 𝜒 # (3) = 66.94, p < .001 suggest that there was a
