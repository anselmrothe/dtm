Exclusions
Three participants were excluded for failing to follow
instructions (consistently making multiple estimates per
trial, or making estimates during, rather than between,
trials). One further participant was excluded due to a
technical error. For all other participants, individual trials
for which there were two estimates and estimates which
overlapped with the time of the event being judged were
removed from analysis (8 participants with excluded trials,
mean average 4.88 exclusions out of 120 trials).
