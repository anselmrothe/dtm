or a single fracture, depending on the scenario). Then, par-

100 (All of them) slider the proportion of patients likely to
be admitted for ailment A in some questions, A or B in other
questions, and A or B or C in another question; note, each
combination of possibilities was shown only once. The triple
disjunction was implemented as a catch question, since the
total number of patients was fixed at 100. An additional three
catch questions were included, where participants were just
told to select a particular response, as a check that they were
paying attention.
   After participants finished responding to the questions for
the three scenarios they were given a version of the the Cogni-
tive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005). The CRT is designed
to discriminate between participants adopting either a more
intuitive or a more deliberative thinking style (Toplak et al.,
2011). The CRT has previously been shown to correlate well            Figure 1: Sketch of the analogy between the physical experiment
