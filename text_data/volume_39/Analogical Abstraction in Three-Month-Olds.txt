range of examples increases (e.g. Gerken, 2006; Quinn &
Bhatt, 2005; Xu & Tenenbaum, 2007). The six exemplars we
showed in Experiment 1, though, is already a larger training
set than the four exemplars 7 – and 9-month-olds saw in
Ferry, et al. (2015). This larger set did not appear to benefit
the 3-month-olds.
   A second route—the one we pursued—is to show infants
fewer pairs during habituation. Although this choice may
seem counterintuitive, there is evidence that in early learning,
fewer exemplars of a relation can lead to better learning of
the relation. For example, Casasola (2005a) found that infants
were better able to learn and generalize the spatial category
of support when they were given two alternating exemplars
of the relation than when they were given six exemplars of
the relation (see also Maguire, et al., 2008). This pattern can
be understood in terms of the general finding that relational
alignment can be impeded by attention to objects (Gentner &           Figure 4. Schematic of events in Experiment 1. A) In the

   In Experiment 2, we presented infants with only two pairs

between AA and BB) or two different pairs (AB and CD).                Results

month-old infants (19 male and 13 female) average age 3
months and 16 days, ranging from 2 months 10 days to 4
months 15 days. Half of the infants were assigned to the same

additional infants were tested but eliminated from the final
analyses (using the same criteria as Experiment 1).
Procedure. As in Experiment 1, there were three types of test
trials, varied according to infants' experience with the objects.
Because fewer objects were used in habituation, we reduced
the number of test trial types from four to three, dropping the
