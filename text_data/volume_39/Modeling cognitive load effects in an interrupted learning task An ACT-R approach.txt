   The concept of the cognitive model for the actual task
setting is inspired by several sources of research. At first,
Whelan (2007) framed a potential fMRI based measurement
approach of the outlined cognitive load facets. In line with
existing evidence from neuroimaging literature, he states
that extraneous load triggers activity in particular in brain
regions corresponding with sensory processing. Such aligns
well to the extraneous load induction by a visual search task
and is incorporated in the model due to the broad occupation
of visual resources. The intrinsic load component is
proposed to be associated with activity in brain regions
responsible for maintaining and manipulating the attentional
focus. In more complex tasks, entailing more interrelated
elements, higher demands are posed on the corresponding             Figure 6: Outline of steps to perform in each occurrence of

information can be adjusted within the model via
subsymbolic chunk-related parameters like retrieval
threshold, base-level decay or retrieval latency. On the
perceptual level, the cognitive switch between both tasks is
triggered bottom-up, at which the change in instruction
color represents the salient screen change (Wirzberger &
Russwinkel, 2015). On the processing level, due to this
salience, the interrupting task receives immediate attention,
represented by a high utility of the task switch. In addition,
during both stages of the task, more specific actions are
regarded as more useful, for instance attending and
encoding available stimuli instead of just searching around.
Thus, the related productions receive slightly higher utility
and can be performed as soon as they match.
   Related to the concept of memory activation is the
important question, which components constitute working
