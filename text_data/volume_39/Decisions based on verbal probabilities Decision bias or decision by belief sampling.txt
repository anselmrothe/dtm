Speaker’s choice of directionality and listener’s
inferences in communication
In communication, speakers will select an expression
according to situational factors. McKenzie and Nelson
(2003) and Sher and McKenzie (2006, 2008) argued that a
speaker's reference point affects her/his choice of expression
when conveying quantitative information, such as the
amount of water in a glass (e.g., "half full" or "half empty").
In a task examining this phenomenon, it was found when
the glass (a 500ml capacity) had 250ml of water,
participants used the description of “half full” when the
glass had previously 0ml of water more often than when the
glass had previously 500ml of water. It was also found that
a listener could infer the speaker's original reference point
(e.g., the amount of water originally in the glass before
more was added or removed) based on the selected
expression. Honda and Yamagishi (2017) found analogous
tendencies in communication using verbal probabilities.
Imagine trying to convey that an uncertain event had a 50%
chance of occurrence using verbal probabilities. Honda and
Yamagishi (2017) showed that when a speaker’s prior
expectation of the event occurrence was lower (higher) than
50%, they tended to prefer positive (negative) phrases.
Honda and Yamagishi (2017) also found that listeners could
infer the speaker’s expectation based on the phrases used.
When a positive phrase was presented, listeners tended to
infer that speaker's prior expectation of the probability was
lower than when a negative phrase was presented.
   These findings indicate that the selected phrase implicitly
conveys important information for decision making. For
example, given that a speaker follows the above regularity,
50% conveyed by a positive (negative) phrase implies "good
(bad)" situation relative to the speaker’s expectation. Thus,

Results and discussion
Numerical representation of verbal probabilities
According to Wallsten, Budescu, Rapoport, Zwick, and
Forsyth (1986), we assumed that the degree of certainty
attributed to a verbal probability could be represented with a
membership function. Peak (the probability with the highest
membership value) is one of the most discriminative
features of membership functions (Budescu et al., 2003).
Accordingly, we assumed that the peak of the membership
function represented the degree of certainty for a verbal
probability felt by a participant. Since participants rated
membership values twice for each phrase, the mean of the
membership values was regarded as the membership value
for the phrase. Table 1 shows means and SDs of peaks for               Figure 2. Relationship between subjective degree of
