Abstract
In the Wason-Selection Task debate it has been suggested that
people may be able to detect cheaters but not co-operators or
altruists. This position has been challenged. Here we focus on
a scenario that is more ecologically valid with regard to
different strategies for detecting workers who negatively
interact with others (here ‘egoists’) and positive interactors
(here ‘altruist’). The results on altruist detection in two-level
personnel evaluation tasks (T-PETs), with information on
individual and team performance, suggested a disregard of the
team performance and a resulting “Tragedy of Personnel
Evaluation”. Experiment 1 transfers the idea of altruist
detection in a personnel evaluation and personnel selection
task (von Sydow & Braus, 2016) to egoist detection and
explores whether there are analogous problems for egoist
detection. Experiment 2 explores egoist and altruist detection
in more realistic settings where individual and group-selection
may affect our sampling of the interactor.

Introduction
In an influential debate on hypothesis-testing (Wason
Selection Tasks, WST), it has been suggested that in socialcontract situations people are adapted for cheater detection
but not for co-operator or altruist detection (Cosmides,
1989). These proposals have contributed to differentiating
between checking deontic rules and testing descriptive
hypotheses (Oaksford & Chater, 1994; Beller, 2001; von
Sydow, 2006). Despite evidence for subclasses within the
deontic domain (Fiddick, Cosmides, & Tooby, 2000), other
research shows that reasoning with standard deontic rules
(including social contracts) seems to be a quite systematic
faculty resembling deontic logic (Beller, 2001; Bucciarelli
& Johnson-Laird, 2005; von Sydow, 2006) and depends on
the goals pursued (von Sydow, 2006; Rand, Dreber,
Ellingsen, Fudenberg, & Nowak, 2009; Sperber & Girotto,
2002). However, the WST-paradigm has also been criticised
as being too specific to address issues of real-life cooperation (Sperber & Girotto, 2002).
Von Sydow & Braus (2016) explored participants’ ability
as personnel managers to detect how employees positively
interacted with others’ performance. Research in
organizational and social psychology has acknowledged the
importance of teams beyond mere individual contributions
(Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, & Gilson, 2008; Memmert,
Plessner, Hüttermann, Froese, Peterhänsel, & Unkelbach,
2015) and the crucial role of prosocial or altruistic extra-role
or role behaviours in teams (e.g., Li, Kirkman, & Porter,

2014). Our tasks were more complex than WST and used
two-level personnel selection tasks (T-PETs; in von Sydow
& Braus, 2016). In these T-PETs, participants obtained
information about employees’ performance on the direct
individual level and on the overall group level. The presence
of the altruist correlated consistently, reliably, and strongly
with the teams’ overall performance (r = .99). Nonetheless,
people tended to evaluate the altruist to be worst for the
team, mostly based only on the individual information, and
tended to ostracise him or her in selection tasks. This led us
to suggest a potential “tragedy of personnel selection”.
To explore the controversial asymmetry between altruist
and egoist selection discussed in the WST literature in a
more complex setting, and to explore the generality of the
Tragedy of Personal Selection, Experiment 1 investigates TPETs not for altruist detection, but for egoist detection.
Experiment 2 compares egoist and altruist detection in a
single experiment and explores further potential factors of
group vs. individual selection. This is broadly in line with
the increasing influence of multi-level modelling in biology
(Wilson & Wilson, 2007), and personnel psychology
(Polyhart, 2012). Furthermore, we explore the resultant
effect of sampling (Fiedler, 2008). We will suggest that
group selection could lead to greater altruist and egoist
detection, but that this does not necessarily imply deeper
understanding. Thus we suggest that in such a perhaps
ecologically more valid scenario several further factors
come into play over and beyond a mere potential difference
between egoist and altruist detection.

Experiment 1
The first experiment explores whether the Tragedy of
Personnel Evaluation is unique to altruist detection, or
whether there is an analogous phenomenon for egoist
detection as well. Here ‘egoists’ have the highest individual
earnings in the team while in fact most negatively affecting
the team’s overall performance. In this study participants
were again acting as personnel managers, repeatedly making
personnel evaluations and selections.
Table 1 shows the average earnings of the negative
interactor, the egoist (E), and, depending on the latter’s
presence or absence, the average earnings of the normal
workers in the four conditions. The conditions vary
homogeneous and heterogeneous earnings for the normal
workers (C1, normal worker with homogeneous earnings
condition; C4, most heterogeneous earnings of the normal
workers) to investigate participants’ sensitivity to small
differences in their impact on the individual level.

about overall earnings of the team. The presentation order of
the pictures was randomized. Again there were only five
workers, with four workers per shift – thus only five
possible team configurations. There were 40 rounds and
four test phases, one after every ten rounds. The first three
test phases included rating-tasks and a team selection task
only; in the final test phase we asked participants
additionally to choose the employee of highest and lowest
utility, and to comment on the task and their decision.

Method
Participants 161 participants from MTURK passed a first
participation-criterion (time spent on the first page > 20 sec.
and < 6 min.) and began the task. 120 participants finished
the experiment and were included in the analysis (52%
male; mean age 33), most of them with a high school or
even a university degree (59% Bachelor’s or Master’s; 38%
high school). The volunteers obtained rewards of $1.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of four
conditions (cf. Table 1).
Material and procedure The crucial difference to prior
work was that we replaced altruist detection by egoist
detection (Table 1). Apart from changed individual and
overall earnings, the scenario, T-PET procedure, and
dependent variables (von Sydow & Braus, 2016). But we
were now concerned with individually best performing
‘egoists’, whose presence correlated consistently and most
negatively with the team’s overall performance. As in the
altruist detection task, participants in each round obtained
overview information in tables about workers’ individual
earnings, together with their photographs and information

the four normal workers (N) and egoist worker (E) in the
test phases P1 to P4 of Conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4
(Panels A to D)
In Condition 1, the egoist is characterized by higher
ratings than the other four workers throughout all phases;
main effect of Worker: F(4, 26) = 4.19, p < .01. In
Condition 2, there was again only a reliable effect of
Workers, PST, F(4, 24) = 25.2, p < .001. Bonferronicorrected post hoc comparisons showed no differences
between the egoist and normal worker 1 (E, N1), predicted
to be the highest normal worker (p = 1.00); but N1, as
predicted, had a higher rating than the other normal workers,
which was also the case for the egoist (all, p < .001). In
Condition 3, again only the factor Workers was significant

3467

(PST, F(4, 22) = 24.1, p < .001). Bonferroni-corrected post
hoc comparisons showed that the egoist was not rated
higher than the normal workers predicted to be highest (N1,
N2) (both p = 1.00), but that the worker in this group, as
well as the egoist, reliably differed from the workers in the
second group of normal workers (N3, N4; all p < .001).
Condition 4 again showed an overall effect only for the
factor Worker (PST, F(4, 28) = 58.6, p < .001), and in
corrected post hoc comparisons significant effects even of
all five workers in the order predicted by the individual
earnings (all p < .01).
The results of the Personnel Selection Task (Figure 2)
show that the majority selected teams with optimal earnings
on the individual level (black; individual-related selections).
Only a few selected the team without the egoist (from five
possible teams), even though this team had the best overall
performance (dark gray; team-related selections). The
remaining selections (light gray) selected the egoist for the
team, along with other, individually non-optimal workers.
With regard to temporal changes, there is an apparent
increase in the proportion of team-related selections (dark
gray) from Phases 1 (9%) to 4 (23%); χ2(1, N = 240) = 8.00,
p < .01. But even in the final test phase, Phase 4, the
individual-related selections over all conditions occurred
more frequently than the team-related ones, χ2(1, N = 120) =
34.7, p < .001.
The highest-utility task (Figure 3, Panel A) reveals
relatively frequent ‘egoist’-judgments (black). In all
conditions these judgments were clearly above chance level
(χ2(1, N = 31) = 63.9, p < .001; χ2(1, N = 30) = 44.5, p <
.001; χ2(1, N = 27) = 15.8, p < .001; χ2(1, N = 32) = 47.5, p
< .001). Considering the team-related judgments (dark
gray), they are also above chance level relative to the other
ones (light gray), χ2(1,N = 31) = 49.0, p < .001 (C2 to C4).

with team-related optimal selections in dark gray and other
selections in light gray.
In the lowest-utility task (Fig. 3B), a similar pattern can be
recognized. The individual-related selections (black) were
chosen more often than chance level, χ2(1, N = 120) =
300.8, p < .001. In the three conditions (C2 to C4), where
one can contrast the team-related judgments (egoist has the
lowest utility; dark gray) with judgments that were neither
individually nor on group-level optimal (light gray), the
team-related judgments overall occurred reliably more often
than expected by chance (exact bin. test, N = 12, p < .001).
As to the comments, 21% participants mentioned
explicitly that the individual and overall group-level contributions of a worker differ, or that there are interactions
between participants. These insightful comments were
highly associated with group-level selections and ratings.

normal worker (N) or the egoist worker (E) as of the highest
(Panel A) or lowest (Panel B) utility for the company

are marked in black, the team-related ones in dark gray and
the neither-individual-nor-team-related ones in light gray.

Discussion

Figure 2. Results of the personnel selection task in the four
test phases of Experiment 1, showing the proportion of
‘managers’ choosing a team of four out of five, thus
excluding worker N1, N2, N3, N4, or the egoist worker E.
Individual-related optimal selections are marked in black,

The results of Experiment 1 show that egoist detection
seems to be affected by similar problems as altruist
detection (von Sydow & Braus, 2016). When the negative
interactor individually contributed the highest earnings but
led overall to the lowest group earnings, the majority of
participants nonetheless rated the egoist as most valuable.
Moreover, in the personnel selection task they even
systematically chose the egoist for the team, even though
the latter consistently performed the worst. This was the
case even though participants were sensitive to relatively
small individual differences. Thus the results suggest a kind
of tragedy of personnel selection as well with regard to
‘egoists’ or negative interactors.
In comparison to the results on altruist detection by von
Sydow & Braus (2016), which seem comparable in population and method, there is perhaps a slight advantage of
egoist over altruist detection. In particular, there were significantly more insightful comments for egoist than for altruist
detection, χ2(1, N = 240) = 7.53, p < .01. This suggests that
the content of egoist versus altruist detection leads to
different interaction detection rates. However, the overall
findings point rather to the similarity between altruist and

3468

egoist detection. There also seems to be a Tragedy of
Personnel Evaluation with regard to egoist detection.

Experiment 2
This experiment explores the potential effect of personnel
selection on the individual versus group level and resulting
distortions linked to sampling only particular information
(thus favoring learning of specific relationships or not). We
combine these issues with an investigation of egoist and
altruist detection in a single experiment. We propose the
hypothesis that group in contrast to individual selection may
at least behaviourally increase selections corresponding to
the group-level performance. However, deeper insight is
predicted to depend on sampling effects that may affect both
individual and group selection. To test the effect of
sampling, the participants were given the opportunity to
influence the material by their selections. Sampling may
imply a greater inclusion of the interactor, which will lead to
a better learning of the interactor’s impact either on the
individual or on the group level and hence to a solution of
the Tragedy of Personnel Selection. In contrast, if sampling
leads to exclusion of the interactor, a correct selection needs
not to improve the understanding of the interactor’s impact.

Design
Experiment 2 investigates how individual versus group
selection and the presence of an ‘altruist’ versus an ‘egoist’
influence personnel selection and evaluations (Table 2).
Apart from this, the conditions used almost identical
scenarios and the interactors had comparable effects on the
group level. The egoist is characterized by the highest and
the altruist by the lowest individual earning. In contrast to
the individual earnings, the presence of the egoist leads to
lower overall earnings of the group, whereas that of the
altruist yields greater overall earnings for the group.

Method
Participants 182 participants from MTURK began the task.
119 participants passed the strict selection criteria (time
spent on first page; correct rephrasing the instructions),
finished the task, and were included in the analysis (51%
male; mean age 35); most of them had a degree (65%
Bachelor’s or Master’s; 35% high school). The volunteers
obtained rewards of $1. Participants were randomly
assigned to one of four conditions (cf. Table 2).
Material and procedure The material and procedure build
on previous T-PETs but vary in some aspects. The data is
again shown for each day or shift, containing individual and
overall earnings. Whereas previous T-PETs involved one
group (with different member configurations) only, here we
also presented two groups, each with 3 employees. During
the experiment, participants received data on a total of 10
employees and 81 days (rounds). Moreover, in contrast to
former T-PETs the participants’ judgments in personnel
selection tasks influenced the materials presented to the
participants. This task was repeated 11 times. On the first
day of each of the 10 test phases (and in a final test phase),
the altruist/egoist and 5 randomly assigned normal workers
were presented. Based on the selection in the test phase,
participants selected 3 out of 6 employees (individual
conditions) or one of two groups (group conditions). This
selected group or these individuals were excluded from the
following 7 days (rounds). From the 7 employees left, we
created the two groups in the successive 7 days, so that each
one of the employees left was excluded for one day.
Although we added some noise (SD = 600€) to the
individual earnings, the presence of the interactor in such
trials still strongly correlated with a higher overall outcome
(r = .95-.98). In every second test phase (starting with the
second phase), the participants additionally had to rate the
10 employees before selection. On the last day, at test phase
11, the participants had to complete a rating and selection
task (here without consequences) as well as the utility-task
(cf. Experiment 1) and a Need-For-Cognition task (NFC;
Cacioppo, Petty & Kao, 1984); and finally to comment on
the task.

Hypothesis 1 (H1): Participants may base their
selections (partly) on the observed performance in the
test phases, with the selection focusing them either on
the group or the individual level. This would entail
more selections optimal on the group level in the group
condition than in the individual conditions: C3 = C4 >
C2 = C1.
However, participants in line with H1 will tend to
exclude the interactor in C4 (group selection) and C1
(individual selection) and tend to include the interactor
in C3 (group selection) and C2 (individual selection).
Based on these expected sampling effects, one may
derive the following hypothesis:

χ2(1,119) =11,84, p=.001; lowest: χ2(1,119) =19,02,

o Hypothesis 2 (H2): People in the inclusion
conditions will learn more about the individual
earnings, which vice-versa would lower judgments
in line with adequate group-level predictions in the
inclusion conditions: C1 = C4 > C2 = C3.
o Hypothesis 3 (H3): Alternatively (or additionally),
in the inclusion conditions people may start to
realize the major impact of the interactor on group
earnings, with inverse implications for group-level
results: C1 = C4 < C2 = C3.
H2 and H3 may both apply and cancel each other out.
Alternatively one may find different effects over time (first
H2 then H3). We predict that the hypotheses will have a
major impact on different dependent variables: H1 may particularly affect the used selection task which may be dominated by the currently shown data. H2 or H3 may dominate
the overall results in the rating and utility tasks. With regard to insight in the two-level nature of the task in the comments seems normally to be limited by realizing the group
level effects; thus insight should follow the pattern of H3.

p<.001); but the selection type had no impact.

Figure 4: Average ratings (with SE) for the normal
workers (N1-9) and the altruist/egoist worker (A, E) of
Conditions C1, C2, C3 and C4 (Panels A to D).

Results
As expected, different clusters of dependent variables
referring to performance effects H1 (here selection tasks)
and to effects of understanding, H2 versus H3 (evaluation
tasks) reveal differential results: Considering the personnel
selection task, compared to individual selection (Figure 5,
Panel A), the group selection as expected (H1) appears to
lead to greater (overall optimal) exclusion of the egoist and
inclusion of the altruist. However, the results descriptively
show optimal group-level answers in the rank order of C4 >
C3 >> C1 > C2. This suggests a main effect in line with H1
and an additional effect, even for this selection variable, in
line with H2. Inferentially, the aggregated correct selections
of each participant over the 11 selections revealed a strong
effect of Selection type (F(1, 115)=119.60, p<.001, η2=.52)
and a slight interaction effect of Selection and Interactor
types, F(1, 115)=9.17, p =.003, η2=.07. As a high
correlation between the accuracy of selection and amount of
earnings suggests, the earnings replicate the strong positive
effect of Selection type, F(1,115)=128.18, p<.001, η2=.52,
Interactor type: F(1,115) =11.10 , p=.001, η2=.09, and
Phase: F(6, 687) = 2.29, p< .05, η2=.02.
The rating task (Figure 4) seems roughly to reflect the
individual pay-off structure affected by sampling (H2). The
altruist has lower ratings than the other workers, and the
egoist is rated more positively. Comparing the ratings of the
interactor to all normal workers, the interactor differs highly
significantly across all 5 measurements (R1-R5), R1:
F(1,116) = 1345.68, p < .001; R2: F(1,116) = 1369.64, p <
.001; R3: F(1,116) = 1540.53, p < .001; R4: F(1,116) =
2028.63, p < .001; R5: F(1,116) = 2731.81, p< .001.
The highest-utility and lowest-utility tasks (Figure 5,
Panel B) seem to mirror mainly the individual earnings of
the employees (high rate of egoists in the highest utility
task, and of altruist in the lowest utility task). Thus the
Interactor type affects the accuracy of this task (highest:

Insightful comments (Panel C), in line with H3, showed
in C2 and C3 marginally significantly higher correct comments than in C1 and C4, χ2(1,119) =3,55, p = .06. Participants, commenting correctly, revealed greater aggregated
correct selections (t(51)=-2,28, p < .01) and ratings (t(56)=2,80, p < .01), and tended to choose the person with the
highest or lowest overall utility more frequently, highest:
χ2(1,119) = 15,77, p < .001; lowest: χ2(1,119) = 3,05, p =
.08. Participants with insightful comments can be
characterized by higher NFC-Scores: t(117) = -2,65, p < .01.

3 and 4 (C1-C4) of the Selection, Utility- and Comment
Tasks (Panel A to C).

Discussion
Experiment 2 shows intricate influences of sampling on
the egoist and altruist detection in group and individual

3470

selection scenarios. Group selection, at least on a direct performance level in the selection tasks, leads to greater overall
optimal selections compared to individual selection (H1). In
addition, group selection increases economic outcomes.
Considering the accuracy of personnel evaluation, the
results create a more complex pattern. Egoist versus altruist
detection does not have a great impact; neither does Individual vs. Group-Selection. Sampling processes seem to
matter and can have simultaneous opposed effects. The ratings and the highest/lowest utility-tasks show that gaining
more information about the interactor leads to stronger
individual-based understanding (H2). Insight in the
comments nonetheless revealed, as predicted, that gathering
information about the interactor also increased the detection
of group level effects (H3). In line with this finding,
insightful comments were associated with the NFC-Score.

General Discussion
Experiment 1 shows that egoist detection, as with similar
altruist-detection tasks, may systematically lead to judging
the egoist as best for a company although he clearly
correlates strongly with negative overall team performance.
Although the results suggest a slight advantage of egoist
over altruist detection, both show basically similar results,
with participants in both scenarios falling prey to a Tragedy
of Personnel Selection. In Experiment 2, instead of egoist
versus altruist detection, other factors such as group versus
individual selection (with group selection improving
performance) and sampling processes (in different ways
affecting understanding on individual and group levels)
more strongly influenced participants’ judgments.
With regard to the personnel selection literature (e.g.,
Polyhart, 2012; Li, Kirkman, & Porter, 2014), the results
warn us against the generality of the suggested Tragedy of
Personnel Selection shown here to affect not only altruist
but also egoist detection. With regard to the Wason
Selection Task debate (e.g., von Sydow, 2016; Sperber &
Girotto, 2002), we found no large differences between
altruist and egoistic detection in the T-PETs (however, a
small one). The results more generally pose the question as
to how far the difficulties detecting the strongest overall
correlation of variables’ presence with overall outcome
points to problems linked to Simpson’s Paradox (Fiedler et
al., 2003; Sydow et al., 2016; Waldmann & Hagmayer,
2001); also whether it is a negative side effect of people’s
constructing detailed logical or causal models over and
above optimizing observed utilities (e.g., Funke, 2001;
Hagmayer & Meder, 2013; Osman, 2010; Sloman &
Hagmayer, 2006; von Sydow, 2016; Waldmann &
Hagmayer, 2001), with the disadvantage that one tends to
neglect small correlations, pathways, exogeneities or
interactions, even if they tragically dominate a scenario.
