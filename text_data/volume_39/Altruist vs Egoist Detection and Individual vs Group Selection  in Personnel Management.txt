          in line with adequate group-level predictions in the
          inclusion conditions: C1 = C4 > C2 = C3.
      o Hypothesis 3 (H3): Alternatively (or additionally),
          in the inclusion conditions people may start to
          realize the major impact of the interactor on group
          earnings, with inverse implications for group-level

   H2 and H3 may both apply and cancel each other out.
Alternatively one may find different effects over time (first
H2 then H3). We predict that the hypotheses will have a
major impact on different dependent variables: H1 may par-
ticularly affect the used selection task which may be domi-
nated by the currently shown data. H2 or H3 may dominate
the overall results in the rating and utility tasks. With re-

   The rating task (Figure 4) seems roughly to reflect the
individual pay-off structure affected by sampling (H2). The
altruist has lower ratings than the other workers, and the
egoist is rated more positively. Comparing the ratings of the
interactor to all normal workers, the interactor differs highly
significantly across all 5 measurements (R1-R5), R1:
