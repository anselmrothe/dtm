Discussion
Participants’ overwhelming preference for isomorphic order
in silent gesture strings provides support for a link between
cognitive biases and this typological tendency. A further sur-
prising finding is that participants very consistently produced
post-nominal adjectives. This pattern is not dominant in the
native language of the participants (English), although it is in
fact more common typologically (Dryer, 2009).
   However, two properties of our stimulus items suggest the                Figure 7: Example stimuli: ‘five large pencils’ and ‘four
