                         Methods
Participants
Twenty-four participants (17 female) were recruited via the
SONA systems at the University of Aberdeen and took part
in return for course credit. The sample size of 24 (12 in each
group) was based on our previous experiment (Clarke and
Hunt, 2016). Average age was 19 years (SD = 1.5).
Procedure
We used a similar protocol to that of Experiment 2 in Clarke
and Hunt (2016). The experiment was carried out over two
sessions, with participants carrying out Session 2 a week after
Session 1. Both sessions took place in the same sheltered
paved area. The paving slabs were used as a convenient unit
for measuring distances as they were approximately the same
size as the hoops (the slabs measured 0.46 x 0.61m and the
hoops had a diameter of 0.4m).
   The aim of Session 1 was to measure how well each par-
ticipant could throw a bean bag into hoops placed at seven
evenly-spaced distances from three (1.38m) to fifteen (6.90m)
slabs away, in two different directions (direction was counter
balanced). A total of 84 throwing trials were completed in
this session (12 beanbags for each of the 7 target distances).      Figure 1: This shows the set up for session 1 from the partic-
