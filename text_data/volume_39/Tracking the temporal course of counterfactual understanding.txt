Abstract: This paper explores the dual meaning of counterfactual conditionals, such as ‘if there had been gloves, then there
would have been scarves’, by tracking the temporal course to envisage the possibility corresponding to the conjecture ‘there
were gloves and there were scarves’ and the presupposed facts, ‘there were no gloves and there were no scarves’. To test
this, we used the visual world paradigm, in which counterfactual and indicative conditionals were heard while four images
corresponding to the conjecture, such as an image of gloves and scarves, and the presupposed facts, such as an image of no
gloves and no scarves, and two distractors were shown on the screen and eye movements were monitored. We found that
people looked at the affirmative image in the indicative conditional, and both types of images (affirmative and negative) in the
counterfactual conditional. Results support the dual meaning of counterfactuals.
