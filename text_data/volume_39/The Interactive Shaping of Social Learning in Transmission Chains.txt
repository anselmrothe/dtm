complex joint task (collaborative cooking) in a
laboratory setting.

Abstract
This study investigated the social transmission of memories
and skills collected from a collaborative cooking task (raviolimaking) and across transmission chains. The transmission
over three generations of pairs of participants occurred under
two conditions. In the interactive condition, transmissions
over generations occurred in face-to-face conversations,
whereas in the non-interactive condition, generations videorecorded their instructions to the next generations. We
analyzed the effects of verbal and embodied features of
informational transfer on task performance. Our results show
that performances improved over generations regardless of
interactivity. In the discussion we suggest that tools (like
cooking utensils) may have operated as cultural affordances
encapsulating and transmitting important cultural knowledge
for the successful completion of the task.

Social learning and the necessary ingredients
for cumulative cultural evolution
Social learning (e.g. Bandura, 1977) is learning
by observing or interacting with another
individual or a product. Social learning
mechanisms enable individual improvements in
the efficiency or productivity of cultural artefacts
(e.g. Ramstead, Veissière, & Kirmayer 2016) to
accumulate from one generation to the next (e.g.
Boyd & Richerson, 1994; Tomasello et al.,
1993;). Such mechanisms include teaching (Kline,
2015),
imitation
or
emulation
(reverse
engineering) (Caldwell & Millen, 2008). Teaching
and imitation represent cases of high-fidelity
transmission, allegedly allowing “complex
behaviors to disseminate and be retained in
populations until beneficial modifications occur”
(Vale, Flynn & Kendal, 2012, p. 223). Currently,
however, it is unclear whether teaching is a
necessary ingredient for cumulative culture to
accrue (Zwirner & Thornton, 2015). The aim of
our study is to investigate how different variants
of teaching (interactive vs. non-interactive) affect
cumulative cultural transmission of skills in a

Transmission chains are a method used to study
cultural evolution in the laboratory. Bartlett’s
(1932) seminal serial reproduction design allowed
studying how content changes when transmitted
from individuals of one generation to the next.
Although Bartlett’s method is more focused on
constructive remembering of information
originally provided to the first generation of
participants and not on the accumulation of such
information, it has largely inspired modern
laboratory research on cumulative cultural
evolution (e.g., Caldwell, Atkinson, & Renner,
2016; Mesoudi & Whiten, 2008) or the evolution
of language and other communication systems
(e.g. Fay, Arbib, & Garrod, 2013; Kirby, Cornish,
& Smith, 2008). However, the method in its
standard form prescribes one-way transmission
without receiver feedback and has thus been
criticized for neglecting the interactive processes
germane to conversational remembering (Edwards
& Middleton, 1987). Indeed, recent work has
shown that giving participants the opportunity to
freely interact during transmission improves
transmission quality (Tan & Fay, 2011).
Cultural transmission of manual tasks

In a series of experimental studies using
transmission chains, individuals built paper
airplanes or towers made of spaghetti and
modeling clay (Caldwell & Millen, 2008). For the
paper plane task, successive generations had
access to different types of social information: (i)
information about actions (new generations
observed what previous generations did); (ii)
information about results (new generations
observed final products and their performance
measured in flying distance); and (iii) information

1641

generated through teaching (new and old
generations interacted about the completed task).
These three types of social information were
designed to enable imitation (information about
actions); emulation (information about results)
and instructed learning (information generated
through teaching). The results indicated that
cumulative learning was found in all three
conditions (imitation, emulation and teaching).
Such findings seem to challenge widespread
claims about the necessity of social transmission
for cumulative cultural evolution (e.g. Boyd &
Richerson, 1994).
Building paper airplanes is arguably an artificial
task likely to be confounded by prior experience.
Zwirner and Thornton (2015) extended these
findings using a more realistic basket construction
task. They found that teaching increased the
accumulation of improvements over generations,
but that it was not necessary for them to occur,
further supporting the hypothesis that imitation
and teaching are not “fundamental prerequisites
for cumulative culture” (Zwirner & Thornton,
2015, p. 7).
Cultural transmission and social interaction

A recent study examined the influence of social
interaction in transmission chains (Tan & Fay,
2011). In an interactive condition, chains of
participants interacted freely with one another to
transmit narrative information from one
generation to the next. In a non-interactive
condition, receivers of the information had to
listen to audio-recordings of narrations produced
by senders (previous generation) and then
recorded their own accounts of what they had
listened to, which were passed on to a new
generation of receivers for the same procedure.
Transmission was more accurate in the interactive
condition than in the non-interactive condition,
and was due to the effect of receivers’ behavior,
including backchannels or clarification questions.
The authors suggested that the motivation or
ability to interact during information transmission
may contribute to the emergence of cumulative
culture.

Our experiment
In Tan and Fay (2011), it could be the case that
benefits of the interactive transmission of
information are related to the nature of the task
(information transfer) rather than to general
mechanisms of cultural transmission. Hence, it is
unclear whether interactivity plays a role in
transmitting manual skills. Our experiment thus
investigated the interactive context in which the
cultural transmission of manual skills occurs. That
is, we studied whether the teaching behaviors of
senders who have experience with a skill is
affected by the presence or absence of receivers
from a subsequent generation. The experiment
consisted in the cultural transmission of memories
and skills collected from a collaborative cooking
task (ravioli-making) via transmission chains.
Chains of three generations (G1-G2-G3) of pairs
of participants made ravioli and transmitted their
experience to a pair in the next generation. This
occurred under two conditions (interactive
condition vs. non-interactive condition). In the
interactive condition, transmissions occurred in
face-to-face conversations, whereas in the noninteractive condition they were video-recorded as
instructions to the next generation. All
transmissions were video-recorded in order to
analyze both verbal and embodied features of
information transfer (e.g., gestures that depict an
action), which may be particularly important for
the transmission of manual skills.
In line with Caldwell and Millen’s (2008)
studies using manual tasks, we expect that
performance will improve over generations due to
the accumulation of learned improvements. We
further expect interactive transmissions to allow
receivers of information to ask questions and
request clarifications (Tan & Fay, 2011), and thus,
to stimulate senders to talk and gesture more. This
in turn may lead to a better transmission of skills.
As a result, we also expect interactive
transmissions to lead to better performance than
non-interactive transmissions. Finally, we expect
longer transmissions from senders to lead to
subsequent higher performance in receivers when
compared to performances following shorter
transmission.

Thus, the hypotheses we tested were:
H1) Performance improves over generations;
H2) During transmissions (G1-G2; G2-G3),
senders gesture more (H2a) and speak more (H2b)
in the interactive condition than in the noninteractive condition;
H3) Performance improves more in the interactive
condition than in the non-interactive condition;
H4) Performance is predicted by the number of
words and the duration of gestures in the
preceding transmission session.

Transmission sessions occurred immediately after
each performance session (except for the last one,
see Fig. 1). Pairs who had just completed the task
explained to next-generation pairs how to prepare
the ravioli. These sessions were unstructured and
did not have time constraints (they typically lasted
2-8 minutes).

Method
Participants

Participants (n = 246; 117 men) were recruited
from the student population of the University of
Neuchâtel (Age M= 23.2; SD= 4.07). They were
fluent speakers of French, and reported having
limited previous cooking experience. They had
previous practice of simple skills like combining
and heating ingredients but did not master more
complex skills (e.g. preparing pie from scratch).
Participants received 25 CHF compensation each
for half an hour of their time along with an
incentive of 0.25 CHF in total for each produced
ravioli of good quality. There were 41 chains (20
in the interactive condition and 21 in the noninteractive condition). Pairs of participants were
randomly assigned to different conditions
(interactive vs. non-interactive) and generations
(G1-G3) in the chains.
Task

The task consisted of two kinds of sessions,
performance sessions and transmission sessions
(Fig. 1). In performance sessions, participants
from each generation prepared ravioli together in
pairs. Their goal was to produce as many goodquality ravioli as possible in 10 minutes. Each pair
had at their disposal a ball of 150 grams of dough;
200 grams of filling made of ricotta cheese,
concentrated tomato paste and salt; a 24-hole
ravioli mold with zigzag sealing for easy release;
a pasta maker; a rolling pin; a cutting board; 2
pizza cutters; 2 knives; 4 teaspoons; 2 kitchen
cloths and kitchen paper; 250 grams of flour; and
a stopwatch. Immediately after the time was up,
the ravioli were evaluated by the experimenter.

Figure 1. Sequence of sessions in the experiment
and groups involved in each session.
Procedure

Participants signed consent forms upon their
arrival. G1 pairs watched a 3 min 47 sec video
tutorial that was recorded for the study (Fig. 1). It
provided information about the steps to be
followed to prepare ravioli in pairs. They then
completed Performance session 1, followed by
Transmission session 1 (together with G2 pairs).
Then, G2 pairs completed Performance session 2.
During this time, G1 pairs were paid, debriefed
and allowed to leave. After having completed
Performance session 2, G2 pairs participated in
Transmission session 2 (together with G3 pairs).
Then, G3 pairs completed Performance session 3.
During this time, G2 pairs were paid, debriefed
and allowed to leave. After performance session
3, G3 pairs were paid, debriefed and allowed to
leave.

Measures

All sessions were videotaped and transcribed.
Information
transmission
(teaching)
was
measured by the total number of words uttered by
senders as well as the total duration of their
manual gestures (iconic and pointing gestures) in
the transmissions. Performance was measured as
the quantity of “good” ravioli each pair produced.
The criteria that experimenters considered to
count ravioli as good exemplars were that they
should contain enough filling and they should be
perfectly sealed.
Results
Descriptive results appear in
(performance) and 2 (transmission).

We tested our hypotheses using random intercept
mixed-model regression (in R 3.4, packages lme4
and lmerTest). We included chains as clustering
variables.
H1: Performance improves over generations.
To test H1, we included condition and the linear
trend of generation as predictors of performance.

Performance improved marginally (linear trend: B
= 2.79, SE = 1.41, t = 1.98, p = 0.051). Condition
was not a significant predictor of performance (B
= -0.19, SE = 2.13, t = -0.09, p = 0.92). Thus, H1
is marginally supported.
H2: During transmissions (G1-G2; G2-G3),
senders gesture more (H2a) and speak more
(H2b) in the interactive condition than in the
non-interactive condition.
To test H2, we included condition as a predictor
of sender’s gestures (H2a) and words (H2b),
controlling in each model for transmission
session. The interactive condition was the
reference category. H2a was supported (B = 71.04, SE = 20.59, t = -3.48, p = 0.001). H2b was
also supported (B = -385.63, SE = 81.16, t = -4.75,
p < .001). Transmission (reference category: first
transmission) was not related to the dependent
variables (for sender’s gestures: B = -7.94, SE
=12.90, t = -0.615, p = 0.54; for senders’ words:
B = -8.05, SE = 49.06; t = -0.16, p = 0.87).
Overall, H2 is supported.
H3: Performance improves more in the
interactive condition than in the noninteractive condition.
To test H3, we included the condition, the linear
trend of generation and their interaction term as
predictors of performance. The performance of
groups in the interactive condition improved
across generations (linear trend: B = 4.31, SE =
2.03, t = 2.12, p = 0.04). Groups in the noninteractive condition do not improve less than
groups in the interactive condition, as shown by
the non-significant condition x linear trend of
generation interaction (B = -2.97, SE = 2.84, t = 1.04, p = 0.30). Thus, H3 is not supported.
The marginal improvement in performance in the
test of H1 is probably driven by the interactive
condition, as the magnitude of the negative
interaction term in the test of H3 is close to the
main effect.
H4: Performance is predicted by the number of
words and the duration of gestures in the
preceding transmission session.

1644

To test H4, we simultaneously included the
number of words uttered by senders and their
gestures during the transmission preceding the
task as predictors of performance (we did not
predict the performance of G1), controlling for
condition and generation. H4 was not supported
(for senders’ words: B = 0.01, SE = 0.06, t = 0.15,
p = 0.87; for senders’ gestures: B = 0.03, SE =
0.02, t = 1.41, p = 0.16). Neither Condition (B =
1.43, SE = 2.70, t = 0.53, p = 0.60) nor Generation
(B = 3.44, SE = 2.04, t = 1.68, p = 0.10) were
related to performance.
Discussion
We investigated whether the interactive context
in which cultural transmission occurred affected
the transmission process and its outcomes. We
observed that senders behaved differently
depending on the presence or absence of listeners
(longer transmissions in terms of talk and
gesture). However, such differences did not affect
the subsequent performance of the receivers (see
Table 1). That is, performance improved over
generations (albeit marginally) regardless of
interactivity, further supporting previous findings
(e.g. Caldwell & Millen, 2008; Zwirner &
Thornton, 2015) and research on cumulative
learning in humans (e.g. Boyd & Richerson,
1994). However, in contrast to the manual tasks
previously employed (e.g. paper airplanes,
spaghetti towers, and baskets), our collaborative
cooking task presented some particularities. Some
materials that the participants had the possibility
to use (e.g. ravioli mold; pasta maker and rolling
pin) may have operated as cultural affordances
(e.g. Ramstead, Veissière, & Kirmayer 2016)
already encapsulating relevant information for the
successful completion of the task. Material
culture, as transmitted by cooking utensils, has
played a central role in the evolution of human
cognition (Malafouris, 2013). Future studies on
cultural transmission in the laboratory should
begin to take into consideration the importance of
such cultural affordances if they want to better
understand the actual ecologies of teaching and
learning.

Tan and Fay (2011) showed that “that
interaction between senders an receivers promotes
more accurate recall and transmission of cultural
information” (p. 405). Our analyses did not deal
with verbal protocols and the amount of
information accurate recalled over generations.
However, based on this previous evidence we
expected to find more increased performance in
the interactive condition compared to in the noninteractive condition. In other words, if more
accurate information were produced in interactive
chains (as previous evidence suggests), it could
lead to an increase in performance over
generations in the interactive condition. Against
our expectations, in our study, this was not the
case. We did not find an effect of the number of
words and duration of gestures produced by
senders on performance of receivers over
transmission chains (see Table 2). Although,
senders spoke and gestured more in the interactive
condition than in the non-interactive condition
(see Table 2), this did not affect receivers’
performance. This result suggests that there is no
clear correspondence between the quantity of
information transmitted over generations and
performance.
In our analyses we did not examine the content
of the information transmitted over generations or
how it was recalled during performance. A
possible theme for further investigation related to
our current results is whether better or worse
performing generations transmit more useful
information over chains. It may well be the case
that worse performing generations communicate
more useful information to next generations if
they focus their accounts on the errors they
committed during performance.
In contrast to Tan and Fay (2011), our findings
showed that in complex joint tasks having the
possibility of asking questions and requesting
clarifications (interactive condition) did not bring
benefits. This could be related to the nature of the
task participants were asked to perform. Whereas
in Tan and Fay (2011) participants simply relayed
information received from previous generations,
in our study participants had the opportunity to
perform the task before transmitting information
to the next generation. This involved access to the

1645

tools provided as well as the opportunity to test
different strategies and solve problems.
Throughout human evolution, “the social
environment, not just individual minds,
has become increasingly organized to support the
flow
of
information
across
the
generations” (Sterelny, 2012, p. 27). Looking at
the multiple ways in which interactive contexts,
task specificity, and cultural affordances affect the
transmission of everyday skills (e.g. cooking) is
an important step towards better understanding
the mechanisms of cultural transmission.
