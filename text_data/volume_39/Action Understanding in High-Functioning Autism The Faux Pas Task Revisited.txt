Conceptual integration First, achieving a holistic
understanding of the depicted complex behavior requires an
understanding of the concept of intentional action. This
concept requires the social perceiver to grasp more than just
individual mental state concepts of belief and desire: rather,
it requires understanding how these individual concepts are
integrated to support the understanding of an action as
intentional. That is, an action is performed intentionally
only if the agent had a desire for the action’s outcome and a
belief that her action would lead to (serve as a means to
achieving) that particular outcome (Malle & Knobe, 1997).             Figure 1. Capacities required for action understanding in

Two Mechanisms of Mental State Inference In addition to
distinguishing broadly between mental state inference and
conceptual integration, we also sought to distinguish two
possible mechanisms of mental state inference deficit: the
commonly cited theory of mind deficit and a nonspecific
general knowledge deficit. In previous versions of the Faux
Pas task, pieces of general knowledge (such as the fact that,
in the above sample story, Clara probably appears to be
younger than she really is) were not included in the story
and instead had to be inferred – in addition to mental state       Figure 2. Conceptual integration requires the social
