picture depicted two or three animals configured in a novel
spatial relation (e.g., two identical pigs facing each other).
The second standard within a given set showed different
animals in the same spatial configuration (e.g., two identical
fish facing each other). The object match contained an exact
animal match from each standard but in a different relational
pattern (e.g., a pig and a fish turned back on each other).
The relational match was composed of new animals in the
same relational configuration as the two standards (e.g., two
