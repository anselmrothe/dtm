   French speakers could therefore be reasonably expected to
prefer non-harmonic patterns over harmonic ones, since their
prior language experience provides evidence that these two
types of modifiers behave differently with respect to order.
On the other hand, if the preference for harmony reflects a
universal cognitive bias, then even French speakers–whose
native language violates it–may exhibit its effects.
