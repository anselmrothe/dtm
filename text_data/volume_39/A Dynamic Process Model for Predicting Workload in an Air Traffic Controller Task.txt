Although it has been broadly inspected, deriving a clear def-
inition forms a rather difficult matter. Nevertheless, there are
two constituting aspects that build a common ground in most
cases. While task difficulty results from the demands required
to successfully solve a task in a given time (Galy, Cariou,
& Mélan, 2012), resource supply refers to the information
processing capacity available for this purpose. In this vein,
mental workload comprises the difference between required

with a higher degree of difficulty. In the LWC, participants
