abstracts and 9 terms in more than 10%. In contrast, only
one word in the PMNeuro database is contained in more
than 10% of the abstracts (“activation”), which may be
artificially inflated due to usages of the word in contexts not
describing cognitive activation (e.g., fMRI activation). This
suggests that the terms we deem to describe “cognitive
processes” do indeed see more usage in the cognitive
science community.
   On an individual term level, several striking patterns
prevail. First, “learning” appears in about 25% of CogSci
abstracts, but only 10% in PMCog, 7% in PMNeu, and 3%
in PMNeuMeth. This reveals that the concept of “learning”
is a rather popular theoretical construct, while being harder
to study empirically via neuroimaging. Additionally,
“search”, “language”, and “logic” all appear in more than

difference in term “meaning”. Figure 3 shows dendrograms

right) when they merge reflect the similiarity of the the
merged terms: the shorter the lines, the more similar they
are. As such, pairs of terms like “acuity” and “visual
acuity”, or “memory” and “working memory” are merged
very early on due to the overlap in words, which is a
limitation of the text-mining method employed.
   Barring these overlapping terms, very reasonable clusters
emerge at the mid-level. For example, at the lower end of
the CogSci tree exists a language group (red & green) and a
learning group (teal). Interestingly, “learning” and
“generalization” are very closely tied. Moving up a few
clusters, a reasoning cluster emerges (black), including
