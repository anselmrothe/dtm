Results
  Preliminary data processing was required to clarify the
results. First, one participant chose “cat” on only 6 of the
180 target trials, and was excluded. Next, the rate of
responding “cat” to each stimulus was calculated to check
for range effects. The cat/dog boundary was not quite at the
center of the scale, but lay between #3 and #4 on the CAT              Figure 2: Categorization probabilities for Experiment 1
