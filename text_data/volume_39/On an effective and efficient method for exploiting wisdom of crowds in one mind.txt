Wisdom of crowds in one mind
                         Introduction
“Wisdom of crowds” (Surowiecki, 2004) is the well known
phenomena, such that the aggregation of multiple estimates
made by large number of people is more accurate than the
estimate of a single individual. Recently, an intriguing
concept, termed “wisdom of crowds in one mind” has been
discussed in the research field of judgment and decision
making (e.g., Rauhut & Lorenz, 2011). In examining this
issue, researchers have discussed how a single person can
exploit “wisdom of crowds” in her/his mind. Herzog and
Hertwig (2014a) argued that this is achieved by averaging
“quasi-independent” multiple estimates from the same                     Figure 1. An example of wisdom of crowds in one mind.

the self-others condition, we instructed participants to take a
“general public” perspective. In the dialectical condition, we
gave the instruction of the dialectical bootstrapping based
on Herzog & Hertwig (2009). In the self-twice condition, no
instruction was provided and participants just made second

   The order of the questions for the first estimate was
randomized across participants and that for the second
estimate was the same as in the first estimate.
Analysis
In the following analyses, we calculated “% MAD (= mean
absolute distance) reduction averaging” (Herzog & Hertwig,
2014a) as an index for the gained accuracy of averaging.
First, absolute distance between an estimate and the correct
answer was calculated per question for each participant. The
mean values of these were computed as MAD. MAD1                     Figure 3. % MAD reduction averaging.

Method
Participants Japanese graduates and undergraduates from
the University of Tokyo (N = 77; 56 men and 21 women;
age M = 20.90, sd = 2.52) participated in this experiment.
They were randomly assigned into one of three
experimental conditions (self-others, n = 25; dialectical, n =
24; self-twice, n = 28).
Tasks and materials Participants were asked to answer
twenty questions about general knowledge based on Herzog
& Hertwig (2014a). Questions were answered twice, with
instructions, as in Experiment 1. In addition, in making first
estimations, participants were also asked to rate their
confidence for each estimation.
                                                                   Figure 4. % MAD reduction averaging.
Procedure The experiment was individually conducted
using a computer. In all conditions, participants first
answered their own estimates about the questions, and rated
confidence about their estimates on a 100-point scale. After
answering all 20 questions, second estimates were made,
following instructions, as in Experiment 1. In the self-others
condition, we instructed participants to take the “general
public” perspective. In the dialectical condition, we gave the
instruction based on Herzog & Hertwig (2009). In the self-
twice condition, no instruction was given, and participants
simply provided a second estimation.
   The order of the questions for the first estimate was
randomized across participants and that for the second
question was the same as in the first estimate.

Further examination about the three methods
The difference in first and second estimates To confirm
that our method exploited the difference of estimates, in the
following analysis, we calculated median absolute distance
(AD) to examine the distance between first and second
estimates (Herzog & Hertwig, 2014a). Median AD refers to
the median absolute distance between the first and second
estimates across 20 questions.
   Figure 6 shows Median AD for each condition. In the
self-others and dialectical conditions, median ADs were
                                                                      Figure 6. Median absolute distance.

M = 8.18, CI = [7.02, 9.28]; dialectical: M = 10.02, CI =

pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test using a Bonferroni
correction: ps < .001). There was no difference between
self-others and dialectical condition (p > .1). Therefore,
these results showed that our method could induce the
difference of estimates as in the dialectical bootstrapping.
Relationship between the difference in first and second
estimates and confidence We examined the relationship
between differences in the first and second estimates and
confidence. Generally, if a person is confident about the first
estimate, s/he may not change the second estimate. We
predicted that since the participants in the dialectical and
self-twice were asked to make “self” estimations, a negative
correlation might be observed between the difference in the
first and second estimates and confidence (i.e., s/he might
not change the second estimate when s/he was confident
about the first estimate). However, this might not be true for        Figure 7. Correlation between confidence and distance.
