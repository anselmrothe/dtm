simulations, Gentner et al. (2009) fed MAC/FAC (Forbus,

retrieved more analogical matches when using the schemas
rather than detailed stories as working memory cues.
   As suggested by the results of the target-comparison
studies, the process of late analogical abstraction opens a
promising avenue for retrieving base situations whose initial
encoding was not especially engineered to highlight their
abstract properties, and which represent the vast majority of the
situations we learn within and outside instructional settings.
In contrast to the widespread potential applicability of the late
analogical abstraction principle, however, the specific target-
comparison intervention falls short of representing a truly
portable cognitive strategy because participants will depend
on the external provision of a second analogous problem for
every new target problem they are to solve.
