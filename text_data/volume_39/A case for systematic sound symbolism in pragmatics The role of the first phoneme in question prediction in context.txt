Results
   We excluded 1 participant from the analysis due to the
fact that this participant took 3 times longer than other
participants to complete the experiment (38 minutes
compared to an average of 12 minutes).
   A logistic mixed model was used to predict whether the
participant thought the response turn was a question (binary
decision, yes or no, using the R package lme4, Bates et al,
2015). The predictor variables were context (initiating/non-
initiating) and phoneme (wh, other, none). These predictors
were coded as fixed effects and compared to a baseline
model which included fixed effect of trial, random effect of
context sample and phoneme sample, random effect of
