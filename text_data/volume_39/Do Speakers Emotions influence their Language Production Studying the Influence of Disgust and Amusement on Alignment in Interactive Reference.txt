four videos that were moderate to highly successful in
inducing the corresponding emotions amusement and
disgust, respectively. The amusement videos were “When
Harry met Sally” (1989) and “There’s Something About
Mary” (1998). The disgust videos were “Trainspotting”
(1996) and “Pink Flamingos” (1972). We selected these
videos because they have been used effectively in recent
work (e.g., Hewig, Hagemann, Seifert, Gollwitzer,
Naumann, and Bartussek, 2005; Fajula, Bonin-Guilaume,

Procedure
After the participants had read and signed the consent form,
they were sent to separate cubicles and filled in the
demographics and answer the mood questions. The
participants were informed that they were going to view an
(emotional) video and were instructed to pay attention to the
video and keep their eyes on the screen, because they would
need this information in the video later in the experiment.          Figure 1. Example of a size trial in the director-matcher
