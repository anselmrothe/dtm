people have “common ground” in their interpretation of
different types of pointing.
   This study examined comprehension of pointing with a
bent index finger at an invisible object behind a wall. The
present study examined participants’ interpretation of the
experimenter’s pointing at an object using either typical
pointing or “enforced pointing” behind a wall that was
either opaque or transparent. In enforced pointing, the
experimenter moved his arm in arc movement. The
participants guessed which object was being denoted. The
wall was also either relatively high (28 cm) or relatively low
(14 cm). We examined the effect of pointing movement
because this iconic movement may suggest the indicator’s
intention of “overriding the wall.” We examined the
transparency of the wall because, if the wall is transparent,               Fig. 1: Experimental setup in “invisible” with

without such effortful movement. However, if the wall is
opaque, the “overriding” intention may be naturally
understood. We also examined the height of the wall. The
enforced pointing movement was more easily understood
when a relatively high (28 cm) wall was used than when a
relatively low (14 cm) wall was used.

  In the typical pointing with invisible widthwise obstacle
condition, the experimenter put the black-opaque widthwise
panel between bottles #2 and #3 and said to the participant,
“I cannot see bottles #3 and #4. Now, I will point at one of
the four bottles.” Then, the experimenter pointed at bottle #3
using the typical index finger. Next, the experimenter
pointed at bottle #3 continuously and said, “Now, I am
pointing at something. What is the color of the bottle you
would guess I am pointing at?” The participant responded
orally using the bottle color. The bottle corresponded to the
distance from the edge of the table: Bottle #1’s distance was
75 cm; #2, 85 cm; #3, 95 cm; and #4, 105 cm. All bottles

                         Discussion
This study examined comprehension of pointing with an
enforced movement of a bent index finger at an invisible
object behind a wall. The study examined participants’
interpretation of an experimenter’s pointing using either
typical pointing or “enforced pointing” at an object behind a
wall that was either opaque or transparent. In enforced
pointing, the experimenter moved his arm in an arc
movement. The participants guessed which object was being
denoted. The wall was also either relatively high (28 cm) or
relatively low (14 cm).
   When the participants looked at typical pointing, they
thought objects both in front of the wall and behind the wall
were being denoted. However, when they looked at enforce
pointing with an opaque wall, they more frequently thought
objects behind the wall were denoted. The height of the wall
did not have any effect in this experiment.
   Participants interpreted that enforced pointing could
“override” the wall if the wall was opaque. They might
think enforced pointing suggested an overriding trajectory
(Fig. 6) to point to an invisible object behind the wall.
However, for the objects behind the transparent wall,               Fig 6: Pointing trajectories
enforced pointing was not necessary. Thus, this enforced
movement was sufficiently informative for participants to
interpret the indicator’s intention to “override” the wall.

That seems to be the reason why the height of the wall had
no effect.                                                        We would like to thank all participants who participated in
