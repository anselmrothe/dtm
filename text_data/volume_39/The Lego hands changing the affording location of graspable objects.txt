                       Experiment 2b
Experiment 2a showed that a constraint applied to subject
hands during a categorization task with foot-press responses
seems to have significantly altered the facilitation effect
previously observed in Experiment 1. It is unclear that this
was due to a simple interference or to a conflict between a
specific motor activation of the feet on one side and of
another activation of hands on the other side. This could
stem for an insufficient subject integration of the gloves
possibilities. Indeed, in Experiment 2a, no rationales about
the glove shaped were given to participants. Thus, in the
present experiment, we proposed to new participants to
perform a five minutes training in which they had to move a
real mug along several drawn points on a sheet while
wearing the gloves. The purpose of this training was to
