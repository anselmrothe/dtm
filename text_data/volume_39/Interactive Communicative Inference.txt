conceptual misalignment (instead they assume alignment and
proceed from there). An even simpler case could involve a
sense/reference mismatch where I use the word “speaker” to
refer to a lecturer, but my interlocutor instead interprets it to
refer to a sound production device. While it is likely that the
vast difference in meaning would cause me or my interlocutor
to notice the misinterpretation, a large class of current formal
models of conversation would proceed as if I was being prop-
erly interpreted at all times.
