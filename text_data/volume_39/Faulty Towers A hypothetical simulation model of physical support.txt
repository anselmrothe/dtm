                              Abstract
   In this paper we introduce the hypothetical simulation model
   (HSM) of physical support. The HSM predicts that people
   judge physical support by mentally simulating what would
   happen if the object of interest were removed. Two experi-
   ments test the model by asking participants to evaluate the ex-
   tent to which one brick in a tower is responsible for the rest
   of the bricks staying on a table. The results of both experi-
   ments show a very close correspondence between hypothetical
   simulations and responsibility judgments. We compare three
   versions of the HSM which differ in how they model people’s
   uncertainty about what would happen. Participants’ selections
   of which bricks would fall are best explained by assuming
   that hypothetical interventions only lead to local changes while
   leaving the rest of the scene unchanged.
