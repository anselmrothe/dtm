asked to imagine changes that happen when this paper is ma-
nipulated in different ways. Several forms of the test exist.
   Shepard and Feng (1972) presented a form of the paper
folding test which required test subjects to fold a cube out of
six connected squares. Two of the squares have arrows that
point to an edge and one square is greyed out to show that it
is the base of the cube. People are then required to predict
whether the arrows align and point to the same edge when
the cube is re-constructed. This essentially requires them to
mentally reconstruct the cube by imagining folding the pa-
per as though the shape was cut-out of the paper. Lovett and
Forbus (2013) developed a computational model developed to
reason about this specific case of paper folding tasks. Their
model takes the approach of simplifying the task by removing
unnecessary details and essentially focusing primarily on the
orientation of critical edges to solve the task.
   Another form of the paper folding task (which is also called
“the punched hole test”), developed by Ekstrom and col-
leagues (1976), is administered as a 6 minute pencil and paper
test in two parts (3 minutes for each part). During the test,
subjects are presented with a sequence of images showing
the stages in folding a square piece of paper. A hole is then
punched on this folded piece. Test subjects are also presented
with five possible outcomes of how the paper looks when it is
unfolded. See Figure 1 for an example of this type of prob-           Figure 2: A sequence of images sent as input to the model

   A number of research studies have used paper folding to
evaluate spatial reasoning skills. While testing a hypothe-
