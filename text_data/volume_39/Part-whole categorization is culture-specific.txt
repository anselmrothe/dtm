relationships to each other in any object. For instance, if one
knows which part of the object is called its ‘face,’ and the
vertical axis is determined, one can correctly predict the
locations of its ‘head,’ ‘sides,’ ‘back,’ and ‘buttocks.’ The
orientation of the object with respect to gravity is crucial;
for example, the topmost part is the ‘head,’ no matter what
the structure of that part happens to be, and changing the
orientation of the object causes the labels to be reassigned.
   In contrast, Levinson (1994) discusses the process by
which meronyms are assigned to objects in Tseltal as an
algorithm that takes a visual segmentation of the object as
its input. (See Figure 1B for an example this account’s

there is a pivot object part and two alternates: the pivot
shares its shape with one alternate, and its function with the
other. An experimental triad is shown in Figure 2.
   The filler trials use the same visual layout as the
experimental trials, and the action the participant is
expected to perform is the same. However, instead of a
single pivot, there are two pictures in which the indicated
parts of the object are similar in both shape and function,
while the remaining picture’s indicated part is the odd one
out in terms of both shape and function. Therefore, a shape-
based strategy and a function-based strategy would tend to
produce the same response. This provides a check on the                Figure 2. Example of a test triad for Experiment 1
