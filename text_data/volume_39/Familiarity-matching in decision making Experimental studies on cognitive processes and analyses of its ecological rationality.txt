analyzed the real-world environment in terms of familiarity.
  Study 1: Examination of inference processes
The purpose of Study 1 was to investigate if individuals
tend to rely on familiarity-matching in a binary choice task.
Method

Tasks, materials, and procedure We conducted the binary
choice task and the measurement of familiarity.
   In the binary choice task, participants answered 100

following format: “X is a city in, country A1 or A2?” (e.g.,
“Sikasso is a city in, Mali or Switzerland?”). The order of            Figure 1: Accordance rate of observed inferences with

According to previous studies (e.g., Goldstein & Gigerenzer,
                                                                      number of hits for each object. This correlation coefficient

Therefore, it can be estimated that familiarity-matching can
be applied effectively in the binary choice task when the
frequency of appearance of the name of a city is correlated
with that of the name of a country in the real-world
environment.
   In this section, we investigated this issue using the
following procedure. As an index of the frequency of
appearance in the real-world environment, we used the log-
transformation of the mean number of hits for each object in
two online databases of Japanese newspapers 1 . When we
searched for objects in both databases, we traced back from
the oldest to latest date as possible (see footnote) on national
news. We converted the log-transformed index into z-scores,
which were used in this analysis.
   First, we calculated the correlation coefficient between
the number of hits for the 50 cities and that for the 50                   Figure 5: Correlation between familiarity of objects (z-
