                   Computational model
We take as a starting point the idea that social cognition is
supported by a probabilistic generative model that determines
how mental states lead to actions (Baker, et al., 2017). We
expand on this approach by building a more powerful
representation of desires, and how they relate to behavior.
   Figure 1a shows the overall schematic of our model. We
argued that a realistic model of commonsense psychology
should distinguish between desires, goals, intentions, and
actions, and our model attempts to do so.
   At the top level we place desires, which combine logical
(and/or) and temporal (then) primitives with simple goals
(such as arriving to certain physical locations). This approach
enables us to represent desires that directly map onto a single
goal (e.g. “go to get coffee”) as well as desires that can be
fulfilled in different ways (e.g. “eat breakfast first, and then
either get coffee and milk, or alternatively get tea”). This
representation is inspired and based on computational models
that combine logical primitives with unitary concepts to               Figure 2: Examples of the experimental stimuli. (a-b)

are computed through the assumption that agents act to
maximize their utilities—the difference between the
subjective reward for fulfilling their desires minus the cost
for fulfilling it. This expectation implies that agents are more
likely to act efficiently given their intention, but that they are
also more likely to select the intention that can fulfill the            Figure 4. Comparison between our model (simplicity &
