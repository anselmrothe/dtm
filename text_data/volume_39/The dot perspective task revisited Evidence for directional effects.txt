   However, a further model with both Consistency and

effect for both variables (β = 0.032, SE = 0.011, p = .005
and β = 0.04, SE = 0.008, p < .001 respectively). In order to
explore this, the data was recoded to classify each scene as
consistent and/or inconsistent for both definitions of
consistency (Table 2). That is, each scene could be (a) line
of sight consistent + directional consistent (balls within the
avatar’s direction of facing and actual field of view); (b) line
of sight inconsistent + directional consistent (balls within
the avatar’s direction of facing, but hidden from the avatar’s
field of view); or (c) line of sight inconsistent + directional
inconsistent (inconsistent based on both direction of facing
and field of view).
