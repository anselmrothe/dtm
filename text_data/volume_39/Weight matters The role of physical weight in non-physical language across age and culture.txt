                              Abstract
   Languages commonly use physical properties to discuss dis-
   tinctly non-physical states and events in the world (e.g., “I’m
   not a huge fan of licorice”). Here, we investigate the degree
   to which associations between physical properties and abstract
   concepts are culturally specific constructs. To do this, we
   tested three distinct populations—US adults, US children, and
   adults from an indigenous group in the lowlands of Bolivia, the
   Tsimane’—on their associations between the physical concept
   of weight and a variety of abstract attributes (e.g., importance,
   emotional state, moral worth). We find a strong relationship
   between the associations of US and Tsimane’ adults, but little-
   to-no relationship between US children and either adult popu-
   lation. These results suggest that the property of weight plays
   a similar role in everyday thought across cultures, but that it
   takes time to develop. Further, we found that these associations
   could not be recovered from a simple semantic embedding
   analysis, suggesting that the cross-culturally shared connec-
   tions between physical and abstract attributes may be learned
   through more complex experiences than language alone.                 Figure 1: Details from Flemish Proverbs by Pieter Bruegel

   To examine this question, we asked three groups (US                          Important* / Unimportant* [Not Important]

option is that all groups will show random behavior, failing
to associate any attribute with the boxes in a systematic way,

Participants were presented with an image of identical boxes
marked A and B (see Figure 2, top), and asked to imagine
that there were two boxes before them, as in the image. Par-
ticipants were asked to imagine lifting up the boxes and dis-
covering that one of the boxes is much heavier (the identity
of the heavy box was randomized across participants).
   Participants read 12 descriptions in succession, choosing
the box that best fit the description. For each description,
participants were reminded which box was heavier, and then
given a prompt as follows: “Which box is [attribute]?”,
where the attribute varied from one question to the next. Par-
ticipants indicated their response using a radio button. The         Figure 2: (i) Illustration of stimuli shown to participants in
