  Experiment 1: Causal relational reasoning in
             Mandarin-speaking children
To test for a relationship between noun focus in word
learning and relational reasoning, we first reproduced
Walker et al.’s (2016) causal RMTS task (see Figure 1) with
Mandarin-speaking children (36-48 months) in China.
Methods
Participants. A total of 64 Mandarin-speaking 36-48-
month-olds (M = 42.1 months; 28 female) took part in
Experiment 1. This sample size was chosen based on
previously published studies using the same paradigm.
Participants were pseudo-randomly assigned to either the
same or different condition. Five additional participants
were excluded due to experimenter error or failure to
complete the study. All participants were native speakers of
Mandarin Chinese, and were recruited and tested at
preschools in China.
Materials and procedure. The materials and procedure
replicated those used in Experiment 1 of Walker et al.
(2016), with the exception that instructions were given in
Mandarin Chinese. The original English instructions
(described here in English) were independently translated
and backtranslated to ensure accuracy.
   Children were tested individually, seated at a table across
from the experimenter. The causal RMTS task began after a           Figure 1: Schematic illustration of training and test trials in
