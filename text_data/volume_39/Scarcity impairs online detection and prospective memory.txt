difference in the number of questions skipped between the
time-poor and the time-rich participants [t(31) = .89, p =

noticed the cue at least once, they were able to skip the same

  To measure retrospective recall of the time-saving cues,
we asked participants after completing the task during
debriefing to report whether they saw any messages
appearing on the screen during the task. We found that the
time-poor participants were less likely to report seeing the
cues than the time-rich participants [X2(1,84) = 3.81, p =        Figure 3. Trial screen for Experiment 1b, where the time-saving
