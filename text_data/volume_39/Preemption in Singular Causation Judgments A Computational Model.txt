                      Experiment 1a
   The goal of Experiment 1a was to test SISC against the
CN model of causal attribution for data sets with a suffi-
cient cause, i.e., P(e|c) = wc = 1, but varying base rates
of the effect. Whereas the CN model predicts maximal con-
fidence in singular causation assessments for any observed
co-occurrence of C and E in this case, SISC predicts an inter-
action with the base rate under the assumption that A’s causal
power generally preempts the effect of C. The goal of Ex-
periment 1a was to demonstrate that this predicted deviation               P(e|c)
from the CN model is expected for the conceptual reasons                   P(e|¬c)
