of meditation.
     In an early review of the literature, Delmonte (1985)
argued that prospective meditators often report higher than
average anxiety levels, and that anxiety predicts lower
frequency of practice. Ironically, Delmonte (1985) also
reported that meditation reliably decreases levels of anxiety
over the course of practice. Furthermore, many studies have
shown that regular meditators tend to be lower in trait

and anxiety may drive individuals to engage in meditation,
while also negatively impacting the frequency of practice. If
they, however, do persist in meditation, these individuals
often show decreases in their anxiety and negative affect.
     The current study is unique in that we recruited healthy
undergraduate students who had not expressed any desire to
practice meditation and simply measured Neuroticism; in
this way, we did not bias our sample toward particular
personality traits. Indeed, we did not tell participants that
they were engaging in a guided meditation in order to
minimize expectancy effects. And we controlled for
frequency of practice by requiring that all participants
simply complete one 10-minute guided meditation in the
