Abstract

decisions. On the one hand, they are meant to be based on
some rule, principle or norm. On the other hand, the
deontological route is meant to be automatic and rely on the
emotional content of the situation. However, evaluating a
decision in terms of consistency to a rule (such as a moral
norm) should be an analytic process (Posner & Snyder,
1975; Sloman, 1996; Kahneman, 2003). There is a
corresponding debate, with some researchers arguing that
deontological decisions are a confabulation of moral
emotions (Greene, 2007; Haidt, 2001) and others rejecting
this assumption (Kahane & Shackel, 2010; Kahane, 2012;
Mihailov, 2016). We propose progress this debate, using a
novel lab-based moral dilemma, that we call The Refugees’
Dilemma. We explore whether it is possible to discriminate
between moral decisions based on the emotional content of
a situation (emotional decisions) and decisions driven by a
prerogative of consistency with a rule (rule-based
decisions).
Moral decision-making has been dominated by the
Trolley dilemma (Thomson, 1985). However, the footbridge
version of this dilemma is ill-suited for the present purposes,
because the deontological option (not to push the fat man) is
confounded with the emotional choice. The novel Refugees’
Dilemma addresses this problem. The Refugees’ Dilemma
is an adaptation of the Trolley dilemma, but involving three
choices: Utilitarian (driven by consequences/outcomes) vs.
Emotional (driven by emotions) vs. Rule-based (driven by
an unemotional rule).
We employ three tools which may reveal differences
between the three postulated routes to moral decisionmaking. First, we measured psychological distance. We
assume that participants making rule-based or utilitarian
decisions will evaluate a situation with greater
psychological distance and conversely regarding emotional
decisions. Psychological distance weakens the intensity of
people’s affective reactions, such as feelings of empathy
(Williams et al., 2014). Furthermore, increasing
psychological distance leads individuals to construe
situations in more abstract terms, which sometimes aligns
with more utilitarian decision-making (Trope & Liberman,
2010) and, we hypothesize, with more rule-driven decisions
too.
Second, we tested participants on the Cognitive
Reflection Test (CRT) (Frederic, 2005), which distinguishes
two modes of cognitive processing, one that is more
reflective and slow versus one that is more immediate with
little conscious deliberation. Differences in the CRT should
align with a propensity to adopt utilitarian vs. rule-based vs.
emotional decision making, whereby we assume that

The focus of the present work concerns the nature of
deontological decisions. We test the hypothesis that it is
possible to specify deontological moral choices based on an
unemotional rule, norm or principle and that such moral
choices can be distinguished from emotion-driven ones.
Using a novel paradigm for moral choice that we call The
Refugees’ Dilemma, we provide evidence for such a rulebased route to moral choice. We show that participants with
high scores in a Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) were more
likely to adopt utilitarian or rule-based responses, as opposed
to emotional ones. We also found that rule-based respondents
reported the highest average psychological distance, more so
that even utilitarian respondents. These findings show how
emotional and rule-based influences can be separated with the
appropriate scenario and challenges the approach of assuming
both influences can be combined into a single deontological
route in dual-process models.

Introduction
Moral decision-making is at the heart of modern
democracies. Therefore, understanding the principles
underpinning moral judgment is fundamentally important.
Consider the recent refugee crisis. The number of forcibly
displaced people worldwide reached 59.5 million at the end
of 2014, the highest level since World War II. Of these
59.5 million, 19.5 million were refugees, and 1.8 million
were asylum-seekers. How do individuals in destination
countries form opinions regarding refugees and asylum
seekers? At the very least, understanding the influences
shaping moral choice should provide individuals with better
insight (and possibly control) into their ultimate
determinations.
The established theory is that moral decisions are driven
by two complementary influences (Singer, 1991; Chaiken &
Trope, 1999). Such so-called dual-process theories contrast
utilitarian responses, resulting from controlled cognitive
processes, with non-utilitarian (considered deontological)
responses, assumed to be driven by automatic/intuitive
emotional processes (Greene et al., 2001; Greene & Haidt,
2002; Greene et al., 2004; Koenigs et al., 2007).
Utilitarian/consequentialist judgments are aimed at
maximizing benefits and minimizing costs across affected
individuals (Mill, 1861/1998), while the deontological
perspective (Kant, 1785/1959) emphasizes rights and duties.
We focus on deontological decisions. It seems there is a
fundamental inconsistency in current understanding of such

93

utilitarian and rule-based decisions require greater reflection
(since a person needs evaluate how the well-being of one
group of individuals is balanced with that of another or
consider the applicability of a rule and the consequences of
violating it) than emotional ones.
Third, we implemented a time-manipulation, whereby
participants would either be told they had unlimited time or
that they should respond as quickly as possible (but even in
the time pressure condition participants had ample time to
respond). Finally, we included measures with a mindset for
practical application. Is responding in The Refugees’
Dilemma sensitive to religious or political characteristics?

Subsequently, the three moral scenarios were presented
(Utilitarian: where ten refugees from another country need
help; Emotional: where a refugee orphan child from another
country needs medical attention immediately; and Rulebased: where a traveller from your own country wants to go
back home and the law from your country specifies that
travellers who are citizens from your own country have to
take priority when returning). The text for each scenario was
supplemented with an illustration (Figure 1). The moral
choice was then presented to participants: “Who do you
allow to your country? Remember, you can only allow
traveller(s) from one neighbouring country”. Participants
had to choose between Choice 1 (Utilitarian; “The 10
refugees from Beta”), Choice 2 (Emotional; “The refugee
orphan child from Gamma”), or Choice 3 (Rule-based; “The
traveller who is an Alpha citizen coming from Delta”).
Regarding the time manipulation, one third of participants
was not provided with any indication of time for making
their judgment (No Time). Participants in the Unlimited
Time condition were instructed as follows: “You will
have unlimited time to answer the question in the next page.
Think carefully about your judgment before responding”.
Participants in the Time Pressure condition were presented
with the following instructions: “The question in the next
page should be answered as fast as possible. Use your first
impression/ gut feeling in order to respond”; these
participants had to make their moral choice while a timer (at
the top of their screen) kept track of elapsed time.
Participants were next asked to complete a 4-items
questionnaire (see Online Supplementary Material), which
was intended as a measure of the basis of participants’
judgments (e.g., “How much would you say that doing the
greater good for the greatest number of people/ emotion/ a
principle, norm or rule was the basis for your decision?”).
The order of these three questions was presented randomly
and participants had to respond moving a slider that went
from 0 (not at all) to 7 (for the above question, completely
based in doing the greater good for the greatest number of
people/ emotion/ a principle, norm or rule). The fourth item
of the questionnaire, following the same format, was a
measure of psychological distance (Trope & Liberman,
2010) (e.g., “How distant do you feel yourself from the
scenario when making your decision?”).
Participants were next presented with three “catch
questions”, to control for attention and basic comprehension
during the task (e.g., “How many refugees there were in the
group from Beta?”).
Then, participants had to complete a CRT (Frederic,
2005) as a measure of two modes of cognitive processing,
quick with little conscious deliberation versus slower and
more reflective. The test consisted of three multiple-choice
questions (e.g., “If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5
widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100
widgets?”).
Finally, participants were asked to complete demographic
questions regarding their levels of Religiosity (using a 7-

Method
Participants
A total of 1508 participants, all of whom were US residents,
were recruited on-line and received $0.80 for doing the task
(706 women, 801 men; M age = 34.6 years, SD = 11.17). As
this is the first study with The Refugees’ Dilemma, no prior
power analyses were conducted and instead we decided a
priori to limit recruitment to 1500 participants. The City,
University of London Psychology Department Research
Ethics Committee granted approval for this project
(reference PSYETH (S/L) 15/16 238).

Materials and Procedure
The study was designed in Qualtrics, run on Amazon
Mechanical Turk and lasted 10 minutes approximately. We
used frequency of Type of Judgment (Utilitarian vs.
Emotional vs. Rule-based) as the dependent measure. Time
(No Time vs. Unlimited Time vs. Time Pressure) was
manipulated between participants and we used the scores
from the CRT (Frederic, 2005) to measure thoughtful (high
CRT scores) vs. unreflective (low CRT scores) cognitive
processes.
After a few preliminary screens (consent form; some basic
demographic information), all participants were presented
with The Refugees’ Dilemma (full text in Online
Supplementary Material). They were instructed to read it
carefully and had to spend at least 60 seconds reading it
before the experiment advanced. The Refugees’ Dilemma
asks a participant to imagine himself/herself as a security
guard in a border control of a hypothetical country, which
neighbors three other countries. Participants are told they
have to make one last decision before borders close (until
further notice) and that there are instructions that entry into
their country will be allowed from just one country.
Then, participants were presented with a reinforcementlearning task to ensure that they had been paying attention
during the previous screen. Three basic multiple-choice
questions regarding The Refugees’ Dilemma were presented
(e.g., “As a security guard, what is the name of your
country?). Feedback was provided and participants had to
keep responding until no mistakes were made.

Dilemma: (1) Utilitarian (judgment driven by consequences/
outcomes) vs. (2) Emotional (judgment driven by emotions)

As a manipulation check regarding time, we examined the
amount of time that participants took to make their
judgments. Participants spent more time responding in the
Unlimited Time condition (18.74s) than in the No Time
condition (14.47s) and than in the Time Pressure condition
(8.11s). A one-way between subjects ANOVA for these
means was significant (F(2, 1414) = 25.017, p < .001, w2 =
.03). A Tukey post-hoc test revealed that all pairwise
comparisons between groups were significant (p = .013).

Results
Validation of the Experimental Paradigm
We excluded those participants who did not answer the
catch questions correctly (92/1508). No other sample
trimming was conducted.
We first discuss results which aim to validate the
assumptions in the design of The Refugees’ Dilemma. We
tested if the three different choices presented in the dilemma
(Choice 1, Utilitarian, “The 10 refugees from Beta”; Choice
2, Emotional, “The refugee orphan child from Gamma”; and
Choice 3, Rule-based, “The traveller who is an Alpha
citizen coming from Delta”) were indeed aligned with doing
the greater good for the greatest number of people, with
emotion or with a rule, as assumed (see Figure 2). As
expected, participants making the utilitarian choice reported
that their decision was mainly based on doing the greater
good for the greatest number of people (M = 6, SD = 1.3).
Participants making the emotional choice reported that their
decision was mainly based on emotions (M = 5.7, SD =
1.4). Finally, participants making the rule-based choice
reported that their decision was mainly based indeed on a
rule, principle or norm (M = 6, SD = 1.5). One-way
ANOVAs for each group of participants were all significant:
F(2,308) = 56.93, p < .001, w2 = .27 for the utilitarian
respondents; F(2,1226) = 337.787, p < .001, w2 = .35 for
the emotional respondents; F(2,2708) = 2511.996, p < .001,
w2 = .65 for the rule-based respondents. A Tukey post-hoc
test for each group revealed significant differences in the
expected directions (p < .001). These results are all

High vs. Low Cognitive Resources, Psychological
Distance and Time
We first considered whether results from the CRT influence
moral choice (entire sample; Figure 3). We selected
participants who reported High vs. Low CRT scores (i.e. 3/3
points and 0/3 points in the CRT, respectively). As
expected, high CRT participants were more likely to opt for
the utilitarian response (59.38%) than low CRT ones
(40.63%). Likewise, emotional answers were more likely
for low CRT participants (55.7%) than otherwise (44.31%).
Importantly, the rule-based response was also more likely
for high CRT participants (60.73% vs. 39.27%), indicating
the rule-based moral choices require a similar route as
utilitarian ones. A 3x2 chi-square test on response counts,
with the variables Type of Response (Utilitarian vs.
Emotional vs. Rule-based) and CRT score (High vs. Low)
was significant, χ2 (2, N=897) = 19.66, p < .001.

more reflective cognitive process (High CRT) or a quicker

Finally, we considered differences in Type of Response
(Utilitarian vs. Emotional vs. Rule-based) depending on
both the Time manipulation (No Time vs. Unlimited Time
vs. Time Pressure) and the CRT score (High vs. Low). The
three-way loglinear analysis produced a final model that
retained the Type of Response x CRT score interaction, but
not the three-way interaction. The likelihood ratio of this
model was χ2 (12) = 11.647, p = .475. The Type of
Response x CRT score interaction was significant, χ2 (2) =
20.225, p < .001. This interaction indicates that the relative
frequencies of utilitarian, emotional and rule-based
responses were different across high, low CRT scores. Of
interest, the frequency of rule-based responses increased
more dramatically between low, high CRT scores (225 to
351), than for utilitarian responses (25 to 38). As expected,
the frequency of emotional responses followed the opposite
direction (142-113 ratio of low to high CRT scores).
Therefore, the analysis reveals a fundamental difference
between the cognitive resources used to reach a specific
type of judgment (as also concluded with the other analyses
above), but these effects were not influenced by the time
manipulation.

We next examined whether different moral changes
reflected the expected differences regarding Psychological
Distance (see Figure 4). Participants opting for the rulebased option reported the highest distance (M = 3.77, SD =
2.1), followed by participants making the utilitarian
selection (M = 3.18, SD = 2.1), and finally the ones
selecting the emotional answer (M = 2.71, SD = 1.93). It is
interesting that participants making the rule-based choice
reported the highest distance, perhaps because the
application of a rule to the dilemma requires a degree of
detachment from the specifics of the situation more so than
even for utilitarian respondents. A one-way between
subjects ANOVA for these means was significant (F(2,
1414) = 38.233, p < .001, w2 = .05). A Tukey post-hoc test
revealed that psychological distance was significantly
different between participants making the utilitarian and the
rule-based selection (p = .018) and between participants
making the emotional and rule-based selection (p < .001).
There were no statistically significant differences between
the utilitarian and emotional groups (p = .089).

Political Views and Religiosity
We first explored the differences in moral choice, depending
on participants’ stated Political Views (Figure 5a). Liberals
were more likely to opt for the utilitarian response (10.11%)
compared to Moderates (5.3%) and Conservatives (3.9%).
Liberals were also more likely to opt for the emotional
answer (33.23%) compared to Moderates (28.53%) and
Conservatives (21.19%). Interestingly, Conservatives were
more likely to opt for the rule-driven judgment (74.93%)
compared to Liberals (56.67%) and Moderates (66.13%). A
corresponding 3x3 chi-square test of independence was
highly significant, χ2 (4, N=1363) = 37.62, p < .001.
Individual 3x2 chi-square tests for each category of

respondents (utilitarian, emotional, rule-based) were also
significant (χ2 (2, N=1363) = 15.61, p < .001; χ2 (2,
N=1363) = 15.64, p < .001; χ2 (2, N=1363) = 33.23, p <
.001; respectively).
Regarding religiosity, we selected only participants who
reported Low vs. High levels of religiosity (i.e. 1/7 points
and 3/7 or more points in the 7 point Likert scale,
respectively; Figure 5b). Low-Religious participants were
more likely to opt for the utilitarian response (8.1%)
compared to High-Religious ones (6.32%). High-Religious
participants were more likely to opt for the emotional
answer (31.04%) compared to Low-Religious ones (25.6%).
Finally, Low-Religious participants were more likely to opt
for the rule-driven judgment (66.35%) compared to HighReligious ones (62.64%). A 3x2 chi-square test of
independence on Type of Judgment (Utilitarian vs.
Emotional vs. Rule-based) against participants’ levels of
Religiosity (Low vs. High) was significant χ2 (2, N=994) =
15.36, p < .001.

Established theory assumes that deontological moral choices
involve a fast, gut-feeling process, driven by the emotional
content of the situation (Greene, 2009). There is no doubt
that this is sometimes the case, e.g., in cases of moral norms
of high emotional content (Valdesolo & DeSteno, 2006).
However, it seems counterintuitive that all deontological
moral choices are of this kind. We supported the hypothesis
that there are deontological moral choices based on an
unemotional rule, which can be distinguished from emotiondriven ones. We provided evidence for a route to moral
choice, distinct from the emotional and utilitarian routes,
and rather based on a prerogative to adhere by a given rule.
The characteristics of the rule-based influence in moral
choice were explored with three manipulations. First,
according to Construal Level Theory (CLT), greater
psychological distance would go hand-in-hand with lower
emotional involvement. We found that rule-based
respondents reported the highest average distance, more so
that even utilitarian respondents. Such a result is consistent
with the nature of the rule provided in The Refugees’
Dilemma, since application of the rule forces ignoring most
characteristics of the different options. Second, high CRT
participants were more likely to adopt utilitarian or rulebased responses, as opposed to emotional ones. This shows
how emotional and rule-based influences can be separated
and challenges the approach of assuming both can be
combined into a single deontological route. Note, other
work supports a view of utilitarian judgments as reflecting a
greater “need for cognition” (Bartels, 2008), “cognitive
reflection” (Hardman, 2008), and working memory capacity
(Moore et al., 2008). Third, a time manipulation produced a
complex interaction with CRT level. Future work should
examine whether perhaps just tracking time might result in
reduced cognitive resources for moral decisions, regardless
of condition.
We developed a new paradigm for moral choice, The
Refugees’ Dilemma, which is based on a situation relevant
for millions of citizens, especially in Europe and North
America. We hope that future work will further explore
moral decision situations informed by relevant current
affairs or near-future social dilemmas (e.g., Bonnefon et al.,
2016). With a mind to such applications, we reported some
interesting correspondences between moral choice in The
Refugees’ Dilemma and participants’ political affiliations
and religious convictions.
