changes due to light and due to cognitive activity employ dif-
ferent activation and inhibition processes, the dilation due to
cognitive load being shorter and more abrupt (Beatty, 1982).
    The ICA measurement disentangles the two types of change
in pupil size by performing a wavelet analysis on the pupil di-
lation record and removing the large oscillations, while con-
sidering only the quick pupil jitter that is related to cognitive
activity (Marshall, 2000). Such events of small abrupt changes
in pupil size are referred to as the ICA events.
    The ICA has been shown to reflect changes in cognitive
load in a variety of different studies since its appearance (e.g.
Marshall, 2002, 2007). However, only recently has it been ex-
amined with cognitive load induced by linguistic processing

there is no clear theoretical reason why differences should be
expected for the two eyes, we combine the two datasets by
summing the ICA events for corresponding time-windows and
conduct the analyses on the combined data.
   All independent variables were contrast coded for the statis-

required the use of generalized mixed effects models of bino-

variable, required the use of generalized mixed effects models
with Poisson distribution. All models included a maximal
converging random structure for both Item and Subject. The

the existence of the gaze cue did not in itself induce additional
cost on cognitive load.
    Hence, we saw that the gaze cue influences predictability of
the linguistic referent and subsequently reduces the cognitive
load it induces. Interestingly, on the cue itself, no differences
in cognitive load were induced either by its mere existence, or
by whether it was cuing an object already anticipated based
on the linguistic context.
                          Experiment 2
The second study aimed at examining, firstly, whether the gaze
cue helps reduce cognitive load on the linguistic referent even
when they are both mismatching with the previous linguistic
context, and, secondly, whether the cue to such an object is in
itself more costly, since unexpected.
