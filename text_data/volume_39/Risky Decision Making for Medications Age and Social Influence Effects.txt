Design
Age was a grouping variable. Trial type and decision-
making phase were the independent variables. Level of risk
taking and difference in risk taking between dyad members
were the dependent variables.
Procedure
Before the experiment, participants received a consent form
explaining the research study. After consent, they completed
a questionnaire regarding demographics and health, and four
ability tests. After that, participants were given both oral and      Figure 3: Younger and older adults’ level of risk taking on
