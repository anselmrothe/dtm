Figure 1: Illustration of the recurrence tests for alignment, coordination, and baseline (adapted from Fusaroli & Tylén, 2016).
Alignment models were sensitive to patterns transferred between speakers. Coordination models were sensitive to patterns
independent of speaker, which included patterns across speakers as illustrated here. Baseline models were sensitive to patterns
within one speaker (i.e., self-consistency). (Figure used with permission from John Wiley and Sons).
Like Fusaroli and Tylén (2016), this was a symmetric di-
