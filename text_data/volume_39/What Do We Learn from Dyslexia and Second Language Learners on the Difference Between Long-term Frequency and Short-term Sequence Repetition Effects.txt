Abstract: Dyslexia is a common learning disability, but its core deficit is still under debate. The anchoring deficit hypothesis
suggests that dyslexics’ benefit from experimental stimuli statistics is impaired (e.g. Ahissar, 2007). In this study we asked
whether dyslexia is also associated with reduced sensitivity to long-term statistics. Spans for lists of syllables were measured,
and indeed, dyslexics benefited less than controls from syllabic frequency. However, dyslexics’ benefit from sequence repetition
was similar to controls’. In order to dissociate the impact of item familiarity from exposure unrelated factors, native English
speakers performed the experiment. They were expected to benefit from repetition, but not from syllabic frequency (in Hebrew).
Indeed, that was the case. These data suggest that benefits from long-term distributional statistics are impaired in dyslexia,
whereas on-line benefits from sequence repetition are adequate. Moreover, our results suggest different underlying mechanisms
for long-term distribution learning and short-term sequence learning.
