Abstract
We investigated how people would change and vary in
accepting advice when the effectiveness of advice was unclear.
In each trial, participants estimated a monthly rent of an
apartment room based on the attribute list. Then, another
estimate by a real-estate agent was given as advice.
Participants made a final estimation, either by taking the
advice fully, partially, or rejecting it totally. They repeated 48
estimations without feedback. The weight of advice index,
representing how much each participant weighed a given
advice, gradually decreased as the number of trials increased.
Interestingly, the gradual reduction of acceptance was not
observed in participants with high empathy and low
depressive scores; they kept accepting advice even when the
effectiveness of advice was unclear. These results suggest that
the willingness of accepting and using advice depends on
history of advice taking, the individual traits, and mood.

Introduction
When we cannot make a decision by ourselves, we
frequently ask for advice. Assume you are about to purchase
a house and have two candidate options. Both houses are
similarly attractive but different in various aspects. You
cannot decide which to buy. Here comes a friend and starts
giving you a series of advice. Will you accept advice and, if
so, how much will you use the advice for your final
decision? Obviously, it depends. Generally, we do not know
if advice is useful or not until the outcome of a decision
comes out. However, under ambiguous situations with time
constraints, we often need to decide whether we should
accept advice. In the present study, we examined how
people would change and vary in accepting advice when the
effectiveness of advice is unclear. In particular, we were
interested in whether advice taking would depend on history
of experience of advice taking and individual traits and
mood.
In general, people heed advice and adjust their estimate
and/or judgment (Bonaccio & Dalal, 2006; Yaniv, 2004b).
However, this advice taking process is prone to various
cognitive bias. For example, people tend to weight own
judgment more even when they should take advice to
improve their judgments (Yaniv, 2004a; Yaniv &
Kleinberger, 2000). One of the biasing factors is a

characteristic of advisor. For example, people follow advice
more when their advisor is labeled as an expert by the
experimenter (e.g, Meshi et al., 2001; Harvey & Fischer,
1997), and when an advisor expresses great confidence in
his/her advice (e.g., Sniezek & van Swol, 2001).
Although the previous studies mainly focused on the
characteristics of advisor, several studies showed that, the
internal states of decision makers (e.g., emotion and
confidence) also modulate advice taking behaviors (Cooper,
1991; Gino & Schweitzer, 2008; Gino, Brooks, &
Schweitzer, 2012). For example, when anxiety is
experimentally induced in participants, they show lower
confidence and consequently a higher level of acceptance of
advice (Gino et al., 2012). These previous findings suggest
that there may be individual differences regarding advice
taking. However, it is not clear how individual
characteristics (i.e., emotion, personality, and interpersonal
reactivity) would influence advice taking. Using three
questionnaires of personality, emotion, and interpersonal
reactivity, we examined individual variability of advice
taking behaviors.
One of major motivation for acceptance of advice is to
adjust and improve own judgments. Therefore, if the
effectiveness of advice is unclear, the acceptance of advice
will decrease over time. In the present study, we confirmed
this tendency and then examined how the reduction of
advice taking would vary across individuals.

Method
Participants
Fifty-four university students participated in the present
study (18 females and 36 males). They gave written
informed consent and were blind to the purpose of the study.
Most of them lived in Tokyo and its vicinity and had some
knowledge of rent in the Tokyo area.

Price Estimation Task
Participants performed the price estimation task (Meshi et
al., 2012), where they estimated rents of apartment rooms.
Five attributes of each apartment room (room layout, area in
square meters, distance form the nearest station, floor level,
and building age) were presented on a computer monitor
(Figure 1). Based on those set of information, participants
estimated the monthly rent of each room (in Japanese yen).

2426

After the initial estimation, another opinion, i.e., advice,
on the rent of the room was given in one half of trials
(advice condition). We instructed them, “Advice was
derived from a real-estate agency who visited our laboratory
to participate this experiment another day and judged the
rental price for them on the same computer,” but the price
was an actual rent of the room around the Takadanobaba
station, Sinjyuku, Tokyo. Then, participants were asked to
decide whether they would consider changing their first
estimation, if so how much. They reported the estimated
price by adjusting the slide bar on the monitor with a
computer mouse, and decided by clicking the mouse button.
In the other half of trials, they did not receive any advice but
still were asked whether or not they would like to change
their opinions (no-advice condition). No feedback was given
about their decision. Advice and no-advice conditions were
randomly intermixed and presented 24 times, resulting in 48
trials for the whole session. The trials were divided into four
sessions. The next session started after participants pressed
the space bar; they were allowed to rest between trials.

𝑊𝑂𝐴 =

𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑  𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒 − 𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡  𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒
𝐴𝑑𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒 − 𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡  𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒

For example, a participant’s initial estimate was 1000 yen,
and the advice was 2000 yen. Assume, after receiving the
advice, the participant adjusts her estimate slightly higher,
say, 1100 yen. Then, the weight of advice index would be
calculated as 0.1, indicating a small influence of advice. On
the other hand, the participant may fully use the advice and
adjust her estimate to 2000 yen. The calculated weight of
advice index would then be 1. It is theoretically possible that
WOA is larger than 1 or takes a negative value. However, as
such cases would represent behaviors different from normal
advice taking or simple response errors, we excluded those
data from the analyses (42 trials). Additionally, we also
excluded the data from 89 trials whose first estimations
were identical to the advice prices, or whose response time
is 4 SD above the mean response time of all advice-taking
trials. The resulted number of trials was 1165.

Questionnaires
In addition to WOA from each participant, to examine
possible influences of participants' personality, mood, and
interpersonal reactivity traits on the advice taking in the
price estimation task, we used three questioners; Ten Item
Personality Inventory (TIPI-J; Oshio, et al., 2012; Gosling,
Rentfrow, & Swann, 2003); Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI; Beck et al., 1961), and Interpersonal reactivity index
(IRI; Davis, 1980; 1983; 1996). These questionnaires are
widely used to measure participants' personality, mood, and
interpersonal reactivity traits in previous studies (e.g, Oshio
et al., 2014). All participants were asked to answer those
questionnaires.

Analysis
In the advice condition of the present task, we obtained two
estimates for the rents: the fist estimate without advice and
the second estimate after receiving advice. The difference
between advice and the first estimate represents how much
opinions are different between the participant and the
advisor. The difference between the second rating and the
first rating represents how much the participant changes his
or her opinion. In order to examine how much each
participant took into consideration or weighed the given
advice, we calculated “Weight of Advice” index (WOA;
Bonaccio & Dalal, 2006).

In Figure 2, we plotted the difference between the first
rating and advice, and the difference between the first and
second ratings. The horizontal axis is the difference between
the advice and the first estimate, representing how much
opinions were different. The vertical axis is the difference
between the second estimate and the first estimate,
representing how much participants changed their estimates.
Each dot represents a single trial. In this plot, two lines were
apparent. One was a horizontal line at the 0 point of the
vertical axis. These data points were from the trials where
the participants did not change their estimates at all.
Irrespective of the differences in opinions, they simply
ignored the advice and did not change their estimates. The
other was a diagonal line. The data points on the diagonal
line were from the trials where the difference between the
advice and the first estimate and the difference between the
second estimate and the first rating estimate identical. That
is, the participants fully accepted the advice. Then the data
between these two lines represented the trials where the
participants took the advice but adjusted their estimates
partially.

2427

To capture various advice taking behaviors, we calculated
the Weight of Advice index (WOA). Figure 3 shows the
frequency distribution of the WOA. The data at the WOA of
zero correspond to the data on horizontal line in Figure 2,
i.e., the participants did not take the advice at all. Out of the
total trials of about 1165, 535 trials were this type. By
contrast, the trials where the participants fully accepted the
advice were at the WOA of 1. These correspond to the
diagonal line in Figure 2. 96 trials were this type. WOA
values between 0 and 1 represent the trials where the
participants partially accepted the advice. In total, advice
was used 54% of trials. This acceptance ratio was similar to
that observed in the previous study (Soll & Larrick, 2009).

= -.524, p<.001). Then, we divided the trials into the first
and second halves and found the significant difference of
WOA scores between them (t(1163) = 2.70, p<.01),
indicating that the participants followed the advice less in
the second half than in the first half.
One may argue that the decrease in the acceptance of
advice over time would be due to that the participants
become better in the estimation task and could perform the
task without advice in the second half. We did not provide
feedback for their estimation. However, they repeatedly saw
the rent estimation presented as advice, which were actual
rents. In addition, the participants had some knowledge of
rent in the Tokyo area. Thus, there was the possibility that
participant’s estimate would approach to the estimate
presented as advice implicitly. To test such a possibility, we
also calculated the difference between the advice and the
first estimate as an index of the task performance (Figure 5).
We did not find any improvement of the task performance
as a function of trial number (r(48) = .041, p=.786).
Therefore, the decrease in WOA was not due to the better
performance in the second half.

Since the experiment contained 48 trials, we were able to
examine how WOA would change as the experiment
progressed. Figure 4 shows the averaged WOA scores from
all the participants as a function of the trial number. We

The overall results suggested that, on average, the
participants followed advice less in the second half than the
first half of the task. However, this was not the case for all
the participants; some participants did show larger WOA in
the latter half. We calculated the change of WOA for each
participant by subtracting WOA in the first half from WOA
in the second half. Thus, a positive score would indicate that
the participants tended to accept the advices in the second
half. Figure 6 shows the distribution of WOA changes.
We divided the participants into the “positive-group”
(WOA changes values were positive) and the “non-positive
group” (WOA changes values were negative or equal to
zero), and examined whether there would be any individual
differences between the two groups of the participants. The
questionnaires measured depressive state, big-five
personality trait (Extraversion, Conscientiousness,
Agreeableness, Openness to Experience, and Neuroticism),
empathy for others (cognitive abilities on a Fantasy Scale
(FS) and Perspective Taking (PT), and affective components
through an Empathic Concern (EC) and Personal Distress
(PD). We compared the scores of the questionnaires
between the positive group and the non-positive group. Two
participants were excluded from the analyses because
significant parts of the questionnaires were incomplete. In
total, the data from fifty-two participants were analyzed.
We found significant differences in depressive state (t(50)
= 2.30, p < .03) and in perspective taking (PT) scores
(t(50)= -2.48, p < .02). The participants who showed the
positive WOA changes had lower depression scores and
higher perspective taking scores (Figure 7). These results
suggest that individuals with less depression and higher
perspective taking tend to keep taking the advice. There was

Discussion
In the present study, we examined how people would
change and vary in accepting advice when the effectiveness
of advice was not clear. We found that: (1) Participants took
the advice less in the latter half of the experiment. (2) The
decrease in WOA was not due to the change in task
performance. (3) The decrease of WOA was pronounced in
the participants with high depressive state and low
perspective taking tendency of empathy. In other words, the
participants with low depression and high empathy kept
taking advice even when the effectiveness of advice was
unclear. Our results suggest that the willingness of accepting
and using advice changes with prior experience of advice
taking and the individual traits and mood interact with the
change in advice taking.
In about 54% of trials, the participants used advice either
fully or partially, even though the usefulness of advice was
not clear. This result suggests that it is difficult to ignore
advice completely under uncertainty of usefulness of advice.
Previous studies suggest that the major motivation of
seeking advice is not only for accuracy in decision making
but also for social reasons, for example sharing
responsibility or to justify our decisions (Kennedy,
Kleinmuntz, & Peecher, 1997; Harvey & Fischer, 1997).
Our results might reflect this kind of social motivations in
advice taking.
Since the participants were not sure about whether advice
was useful or not in the present study, it was reasonable to
assume that the acceptance of advice would reduce over
time. However, this was not the case for all the participants;
low depressive and high perspective taking participants kept
taking advice. Also, there was the negative correlation
between depressive scores and perspective taking scores. It
has been reported that depression is associated with focused
attention on the self rather than others (Ingram, 1990) and
focusing increases the accruing periods and severity of
depression (e.g., Just & Alloy, 1997; Kuehner & Weber,
1999; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000; Nolen-Hoeksema, Parker, &
Larson, 1994). However, it still remains to be investigated
how depressive mood and the ability of perspective taking
influence and/or interact with advice taking behavior.
In the present study, we set the situation that advice was
derived from a real-estate agency. There is the possibility
that this information about advisor would help to increase
the acceptance of advice even when the effectiveness of
advice was not clear. A previous research showed that
people valued expert advice than novice one when making
decisions (e.g., Meshi et al., 2001). Therefore, the
characteristics of an advisor have influences in advice
taking, which include not only expertise but also how
closely the advising person is related. In our daily-life, we
often ask friends or family for advice, even though we can
seek expert advice. Recent research suggests that advice
would be accompanied by social and emotional support (i.e,
regulating emotional distress), and decision makers prefer
such emotional and social support when they make
decisions (Horowitz et al., 2001; Dalal & Bonaccio, 2010).

In the future research, it would also be interesting to
examine the role of seeking or accepting advice derived
from others that have close associations with them, such as
friends or family.
In the present study, no feedback was provided, It is
possible that providing feedback may affect the acceptance
of advice over time. We found the decrease of WOA over
time when the effectiveness of advice was uncertain.
Providing feedback would make participants to explicitly
adjust their estimates. In future research, it would be
important to examine the effects of feedback on temporal
variations for the acceptance of advice.
