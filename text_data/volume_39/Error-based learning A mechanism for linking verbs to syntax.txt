   Verb bias effects emerge early in acquisition (Peter et al.,                 Of particular interest here, syntactic priming shows ‘in-

                                                                         754

That is, priming effects are larger if the structure of the prime
sentence is unexpected. To illustrate, Bernolet and Hartsuiker
(2010), in a study of adult sentence production, reported that
(a) DO prime sentences exerted a larger priming effect (rela-
tive to baseline) than did prime sentences in the more fre-
quent PO structure, and (b) the magnitude of syntactic prim-
ing depended on verb bias: The effect of a DO prime was
larger if a PO-biased verb (one that rarely appears in this
structure) appeared in the prime sentence. Children show
similar effects of verb bias on the magnitude of syntactic
priming (Peter et al., 2015). This pattern points to error-based
implicit learning as a mechanism for syntactic priming: We
expect likely structures, and thus learn more from the unex-
pected, continuously adapting the language-processing sys-
tem to a changing linguistic environment (Chang, Dell, &
