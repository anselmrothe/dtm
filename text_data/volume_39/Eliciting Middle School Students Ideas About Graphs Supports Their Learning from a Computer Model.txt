  2: Vague, incorrect, or not focused on stored glucose. (1) When the light was turned off less glucose was used. (2) no because, if you
  leave the light off it will die
  3: Partially correct or simple. (1) The total glucose stored was steadily going up then when the light turned off it went down. (2)
  Marcia’s prediction is not correct. Even though the plant will not make glucose or use anymore, the amount of glucose stored would go
  down and so will the glucose made.
  4S: Plants survive in the dark by using stored glucose. (1) when the light turned off the plant did not make glucose but only used the
  glucose that the plant stored. (2) No, a plant to use glucose needs glucose. And plant don’t get the needed sunlight when the light is off so
  has to eat into the glucose stored.
  4G: Explanation of graph shapes. (1) Turning the light off in addition to causing the glucose stored to go down, it would also cause
  the glucose made to stop increasing and just stay the same. Turning the light off would not, however, effect the total glucose used, which
  would keep going up. (2) Marcia’s prediction is incorrect because the glucose stored line in the graph goes down and doesn’t stay level.
  5: Relating the graph’s shape to the plant’s use of stored glucose. (1) It affected the shape of the graph because the plant cannot make
  glucose, so the plant has to use the stored glucose. This makes the stored glucose go down in quantity. (2) No, because if the plant doesn’t
  make any at night and still uses it where is it coming from. It must be the storage and that must make it go down.
