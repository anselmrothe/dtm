Participants completed a survey for approximately 30
minutes online through Qualtrics. Participants currently in a
romantic relationship (intact couples) were asked to
describe various qualities of their current relationship.
Individuals not currently in a relationship were asked to
imagine their most recent romantic relationship prior to its
dissolution (dissolved couples). Duration of the relationship
was measured from its current state (for intact couples) or
its final duration (for dissolved couples) in months (n=395)
and month- and year-based categorical bins (n=655) (see
Figure 1).
   Participants reported three measures of relationship
quality on Likert scales:
         Love: “How in love with your partner are you?”
         Trust: “How much do you trust your partner?”
         Satisfaction: “In general, how satisfied are you
        with your current relationship with your partner?”
   Love was measured only for participants indicating

Survival Analysis
While the quality-over-time plots are indicative of general
trends, they do not accurately reflect the outcome of all
relationships. Many of the currently intact relationships in
our sample will end after the completion of the study. That
is, the eventual outcome for these relationships is unknown
(or censored), and we should not assume that they will
never end.
