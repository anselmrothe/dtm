of the two groups – the in-group. In this simple model, we as-
sume that the agent observes two dimensions of the groups:
an attitudinal dimension, A and another dimension X. Here
we assume that the dimension X is not stereotypical in the
sense that it does not serve as the basis for categorization. In
each period, the agent samples the group or not. When the
agent samples a group she observes both dimensions A and X
of one of its members.

in period t, two things happen.

operates. Because our explanation focuses on a different
level than explanations that focus on information processing,
it does not contradict these. Rather, it complements them.
Our analyses and the experimental findings discussed above
suggest that both types of mechanisms likely play a role in
explaining why people see their in-groups as more heteroge-
neous than their out-groups.
   The most closely related paper to ours is a paper by Linville
et al. (1989). It analyzes an exemplar model that describes
how information about groups is encoded, stored and re-
called. The authors argue that higher familiarity with the
in-group than with the out-group is the cause of the bias.
Familiarity in this case is the number of exemplars of each
group a person has encountered. They model the encoding,
storage and recall of the information using a set of param-
eters and show that the strength of the bias depends on the
information processing. They also consider the case of per-          Figure 5: Model with unbiased variance estimator: Likeli-
