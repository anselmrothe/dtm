Procedure
Children completed 3 pretest trials, followed by 8 focal
resource allocation trials, followed by the Happy/Sad Stroop
Task. All children were tested in a quiet room in the
laboratory or at their local school by an experimenter. All
children were videotaped with the exception of 6 children
whose parents did not provide video consent and 4 due to
technical issues. The experimenter or a trained research
assistant also transcribed answers as children during test.
Pretest Trials All children began were introduced to the
structure of the storybook task via 3 pretest trials aimed at
making children understand the relevant components of
each story. In the first panel, the experimenter showed the
child two dinosaurs and said that sometimes in the stories
some characters will have different amounts. She then
indicated that one dinosaur had way more candy than
another, and asked the child to recount which dinosaur had
more. In the second panel, the experimenter showed the
child two dinosaurs and said one worked harder than                   The types of trials and numbers used in each trial are
