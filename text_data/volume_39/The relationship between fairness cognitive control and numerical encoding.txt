Abstract
Fairness, or the ability to distribute resources in a manner that
accords with societally recognized principles of justice, is a
hallmark of human cooperation. Young children rapidly
develop the ability to enact fairness, but the cognitive
underpinnings of this ability remain unknown. The present
study investigated 4-7-year-olds’ acquisition of three
principles of fairness -- equality (the principle that all parties
should have the same), merit (the principle that those who
work harder should get more), and starting opportunity (the
principle that those who started with less should get more) -in relation to their emerging cognitive control and memory for
numerical information (numerical accuracy). Cognitive
control predicted children’s equal sharing, whereas numerical
accuracy predicted merit-based sharing. Children up through
the oldest age we tested ignored starting opportunities. The
results suggest that different principles of fairness may be
underpinned by distinct cognitive processes.

Introduction
Fairness, or the ability to distribute resources in a manner
that accords with societally recognized principles of justice,
serves as a foundation for human cooperation and is a
critical cognitive achievement of early childhood. In spite of
the fact that the concept of fairness itself is ubiquitous, its
specific manifestation varies across individuals, cultures,
and social groups (Schafer, Haun, & Tomasello, 2015).
Even within a given cultural group, many possible
principles of fairness exist. For example, people endorse the
idea that principles of equality and merit are both fair. The
key empirical question is how people shift between different
potential principles of fairness and what accounts for the
acquisition of these different forms of fairness. In this work,
we explored the cognitive predictors of young children’s
fairness behavior in a third-party resource allocation task.
Recent work in developmental psychology finds that even
infants possess rudimentary concepts of fairness (Sloane,
Baillargeon, & Premack, 2012; Schmidt & Sommerville,
2012). Throughout preschool and middle childhood,
children appreciate at least three distinct principles of
fairness: equality (Rakoczy, Kaufmann, & Lohse, 2016;
Smith, Blake, & Harris, 2013), merit (Baumard, Mascaro, &
Chevallier, 2012; Damon, 1975; Jara-Ettinger, Gibson,
Kidd, & Piantadosi, 2015; Kanngiesser & Warneken, 2012),
and starting opportunity (McCrink, Bloom, & Santos, 2010;
Ng, Heyman, & Barner, 2011). However, children do not
always use these principles consistently. For example,
although 3-year-olds pay attention to merit-based
information (Baumard et al., 2012) and are able to
incorporate it into their resource allocation decisions even

when doing so is costly (Hamann et al., 2011; Kanngiesser
& Warneken, 2012), they often ignore information about
merit and enact equal distributions instead (Baumard,
Mascaro, & Chevallier, 2012; Damon, 1975; Rizzo,
Elenbaas, Cooley, & Killen, 2016).
One possibility for these discrepant results may be that
different principles of fairness are underpinned by unique
cognitive processes. In this work, we investigated two
potential cognitive processes underlying children’s resource
distribution: children’s memory for numerical information
and children’s cognitive control. Accurately encoding
quantitative information is essential for both equality-based
and merit-based allocation. Numerical skills operate at two
levels for resource distribution tasks. First, a general
numerical ability is necessary for children to execute even a
simple division into two equal subsets that are matched on
cardinal equivalence (see Muldoon, Lewis, & Freeman,
2009; Sarnecka & Wright, 2013). Indeed, counting abilities
have been proposed and also recently found to relate to
children’s abilities to share resources equally (Chernyak,
Sandham, Harris, & Cordes, 2016; Frydman & Bryant,
1988; Squire & Bryant, 2002).
Merit-based distribution also requires attending to
quantitative information about relative effort (i.e., that one
person worked twice as hard as another) and subsequently
incorporating that information into decisions about resource
allocation (i.e., that the harder worker must therefore receive
twice as much). Similarly, information about starting
opportunities must be encoded in order to be used. Thus,
sharing between two recipients based on merit or starting
opportunity requires trial specific numerical encoding. In
this work, we looked at whether children encoded exact
numerical information for each trial or whether the
information was encoded only approximately.
Finally, we looked at children’s emerging cognitive
control. Distributing resources according to merit or starting
opportunity requires holding in mind multiple -- and often
conflicting -- pieces of information and “rules” regarding
resource distribution (Zelazo, Helwig, & Lau, 1996). For
example, a child must keep in mind that one person worked
harder, but also that that person had a greater starting
opportunity to begin with (McCrink et al., 2010). Prior work
has found relationships between children’s inhibitory
control and their abilities to execute the normatively
appropriate resource allocation in costly first-party tasks
(Blake, Piovesan, Montinari, Warneken, & Gino, 2015;
Steinbeis & Over, 2017). In third-party tasks of the type that
we investigated, cognitive control may serve as a behavioral
tool through which they may control their behavioral
responses and implement a target distribution.

In this study, we presented 4-7-year-old children with a
series of trials in which children were presented with stories
about animal characters that had expended either equal or
unequal amounts of work in order to acquire resources that
would be jointly sold. Each character also had either equal
or unequal amounts of starting opportunities. After hearing
each story, children were provided with a set of resources to
split between these characters. We tested children’s memory
for numerical information by asking children to recall the
amounts of work and starting opportunities for each
character after each trial. We also tested children’s cognitive
control by administering the Happy/Sad Stroop task
(Lagattuta, Sayfan, & Monsour, 2011).

Method
Participants
Participants were 67 children (35 female, 32 male) between
the ages of 4 and 7. This age-range included a younger age
group of 33 4-5-year-olds (Mean age = 5.00; Range = 4.11 5.82) and an older age group of 34 6-7-year-olds (Mean age
= 7.10, Range = 6.00 - 8.03). Children were tested either in
the laboratory or at a local preschool or elementary school.

Materials
Materials were 12 sets of storybook panels (described
below), 8 sets of plastic cookies for the resource allocation
tasks, and a set of 24 black and white pictures of smiley
faces (12 representing sad faces and 12 representing happy
faces) for the Happy/Sad Stroop Task.

recount if one had worked harder. Incorrect responses were
followed with corrective feedback and re-prompts.
Test Trials In each resource allocation trial, children were
presented with two animal characters (e.g., two cats) who
each acquired resources to achieve a shared goal (e.g.,
catching fish to sell at the market). The characters
contributed either equal or unequal amounts of work
towards the shared goal (e.g., one cat caught 4 fish the other
caught 2). The characters also had either the same or
different starting opportunities (e.g., one cat fished from a
pond with 4 fish whereas the other cat fished from a pond
with only 2 fish).
An example of the materials and wording of the task is
shown in Figure 1 below.
We used a 2 (Starting Opportunity: Equal or Unequal) x 2
(Work Expended: Equal or Unequal) design in which we
presented each child with 4 different trial types (2 of each
type totaling 8 trials per child): (a) all equal trials (i.e., trials
in which characters had exactly the same starting
opportunity and expended the same amounts of effort); (b)
equal opportunity, unequal work trial, (c) unequal
opportunity, equal work trials (e.g., a trial in which two cats
both obtain 2 fish, but one started with a pond that only had
2 and another started with a pond that had 4), and (d)
unequal opportunity, unequal work trials. In these last trials,
characters produced unequal amounts of work, but also had
different starting opportunities. For example, one cat caught
2 out of 4 fish and another caught 1 out of 2 fish. The ratio
of opportunity to work expended was thus equal.
Figure 1: Example of a Resource Allocation Trial

Procedure
Children completed 3 pretest trials, followed by 8 focal
resource allocation trials, followed by the Happy/Sad Stroop
Task. All children were tested in a quiet room in the
laboratory or at their local school by an experimenter. All
children were videotaped with the exception of 6 children
whose parents did not provide video consent and 4 due to
technical issues. The experimenter or a trained research
assistant also transcribed answers as children during test.
Pretest Trials All children began were introduced to the
structure of the storybook task via 3 pretest trials aimed at
making children understand the relevant components of
each story. In the first panel, the experimenter showed the
child two dinosaurs and said that sometimes in the stories
some characters will have different amounts. She then
indicated that one dinosaur had way more candy than
another, and asked the child to recount which dinosaur had
more. In the second panel, the experimenter showed the
child two dinosaurs and said one worked harder than
another and asked the child to recount which one worked
harder. Finally, in the last panel, the experimenter showed
the child two dinosaurs and said both had the same and
worked the same amounts. She then asked the child to
recount whether either of the dinosaurs had more and also to

The types of trials and numbers used in each trial are
summarized Table 1 below. As may be noted in this table,
the work ratios between the two characters were 1:1 if equal
and always 2:1 if unequal (i.e., the character who worked
more obtained twice as much). Additionally, ratios between

1765

a given character’s starting opportunity and work expended
were also either 1:1 or 2:1.
Each of these four trial types were presented in 2 blocks:
a large number block in which we used relatively large
numbers of starting opportunities and work expended (e.g.,
8 and 4 fish), and a small number block in which we used
relatively small numbers of starting opportunities and work
expended (e.g., 4 and 2 fish). Within each block, the
presentation of the four different trial types were
counterbalanced with a Williams Latin Square design. We
also counterbalanced which block type (large vs. small) was
presented first as well as whether the larger vs. smaller
numbers appeared on the child’s right or left side. Each trial
used one of four possible animal pairs: cats that fished fish,
rabbits that grew carrots, bears that picked apples, and
monkeys that picked bananas. Presentation of animal types
and colors of animal characters were fixed.
Resource Allocation After being read each scenario (trial
type), children were shown 6 plastic cookies that the
characters earned from their joint effort. Children were told
that they had to decide which characters should get which
cookies. Cookies were arranged in a linear array in between
two cardboard boxes that depicted the two animal
characters. We note that we used 6 cookies specifically
because they enabled either distribution according to
equality (i.e., 3 cookies to each character) or distribution
according to a 2:1 merit ratio (i.e., 4 cookies to the harder
worker and 2 to the less hard worker). We recorded the
amount children gave to each character.

Numerical Accuracy Following resource distribution for
each trial, boxes and materials were closed and put away,

and children were asked four questions to assess their
memories for the numerical information presented to them
in the trial: two questions asking them to recall the
characters’ starting opportunities (e.g. “How many fish did
green Kitty have in green Kitty’s pond? How about red
Kitty?”) and two questions asking them to recall the
characters’ work expended (e.g., “And how many fish did
green Kitty get out of green Kitty’s pond? How about red
Kitty?”). For each of these, we computed a continuous
accuracy measure reflecting the Percent Absolute Error that
children’s answers displayed (Siegler & Booth, 2004).
Percent Absolute Error (PAE) was calculated via the
following formula:
PAE =

|𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 ! 𝑠 𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟 − 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟|
𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟

This score reflected the deviation of the child’s answer
from the correct answer. For example, a child who answered
that there were 5 fish when the correct answer was 4 would
receive a PAE score of |5-4|/4 = 25%. Thus, high PAE
scores indicated lower accuracy, and low PAE scores
reflected higher accuracy (with a score of 0 indicating
having correctly recalled the exact number). On each trial,
each child was given two scores assessing trial specific
numerical encoding: a Starting Opportunity PAE reflecting
the average PAE of the two opportunity questions, as well
as a Work Expended PAE reflecting the average PAE of the
two work expended questions on that trial. These are labeled
as trial specific because they reflected children’s accuracy
for numbers on that specific trial only.
Additionally, children received an Overall PAE reflecting
numerical accuracy average across all 32 questions asked (4
per trial), which reflected general numerical memory. This
was referred to as general numerical memory because it
reflected children’s tendency to correctly estimate numbers
overall, not on any given trial.
Cognitive Control After completion of all 8 resource
distribution trials, children were administered a version of
the Happy/Sad Stroop Task. Following procedures used in
(Lagattuta et al., 2011), children were introduced to a happy
and a sad face and asked to label them. They were then told
they would be playing an “opposite” game in which they
had to label happy faces as “sad” and sad faces as “happy”.
After ensuring all children understood task instructions,
children completed 4 practice trials (corrective feedback
was provided) followed by 20 test trials (no corrective
feedback). Children were given a Cognitive Control Score
between 0-20 reflecting the number of correct test trials.

Results
Preliminary results showed no effects of gender or block
type, so we collapsed data across these variables. We first
sought to characterize children’s resource allocation
decisions by coding the outcomes as equal, merit, or other
(unequal for equal trials or against merit; see Figure 2).

1766

We ran separate models predicting children’s tendency to
share resources equally. We ran a within-subjects mixed
linear model using equal sharing allocation as the dependent
variable and Age (entered continuously), Work Expended
(equal or unequal), Initial Opportunity (equal or unequal)
and all interaction effects as the predictors. There was a
significant main effect of Work Expended, F(1,528) =
9.102, p = .003 a significant Age x Work Expended
interaction, F(1,528) = 18.07, p < .001, and no other
significant effects (p’s > .15). Thus, equal allocations were
predicted by age and whether the characters had expended
equal amounts of work.

Note. Merit-based sharing is impossible in Equal Work
Expended Trials
We also looked at predictors of merit-based sharing.
Children were coded as having given a merit-based
allocation if they had given more resources to the harder
working character (i.e., one who produced a greater amount
of resources). Because merit-based sharing was not possible
in the All Equal trial, we excluded this trial from that
analysis. There was a significant Age x Work Expended
interaction, F(1,396) = 4.81, p = 0.03, and no other
significant effects (all p’s > .09). Thus, children made more
merit-based allocations with age.
To better characterize these interactions, we explored how
age impacted merit-based and equality-based sharing
separately in each trial type. We thus ran follow-up models
for equal work expended and unequal work expended trials
using Age as a predictor. The results of these analyses are
summarized in Table 2 (Model 1). We ran separate models
using equal sharing as a response and then merit-based
sharing as a response.
As shown in Table 2, Age predicted equal sharing in the
trials in which characters produced equal amounts of work
(top panel of Table 2; All Equal and Unequal Opportunity,
Equal Work trials), whereas Age predicted merit-based
sharing in trials in which characters produced unequal
amounts of work (bottom panel of Table 2).
Therefore, confirming the previous analyses, all children
ignored starting opportunities. However, age predicted
children’s likelihood of selecting the “correct” allocation
type in each trial - equal-based sharing in the trials in which

characters produced equal amounts of work, and meritbased sharing in the trials in which characters produced
unequal amounts of work.
We next investigated whether these age-related changes
were explained by numerical accuracy or cognitive control.
In particular, we first looked at whether children’s
numerical accuracy predicted their resource allocation
decisions. Recall that on each trial, each child was given
two scores: a Starting Opportunity PAE and a Work
Expended PAE. Preliminary analyses revealed no
differences between the two PAE types, suggesting that
children were equally adept at encoding both types of
information.
We first looked at the predictors of each PAE type. For
each model, we ran a mixed linear model using Age, Work
Expended, and Initial Opportunity as predictors. We also
included Cognitive Control Total Correct as a covariate to
ensure that any potential age-related changes in encoding
accuracy were not simply attributable to changes in
cognitive control.
For Starting Opportunity PAE, there was a significant
effect of Age, F(1,464) = 93.71, p < .001, with older
children showing lower PAE (higher accuracy) for initial
opportunity and no other significant effects (all p’s > .25).
For Work Expended PAE, there was a significant effect of
Age, F(1,464) = 43.89, p < .001, and a significant effect of
Work Expended Trial Type, F(1,464) = 20.05, p < .001,
with children showing worse encoding of work expended
when the characters put in unequal amounts of work.
Therefore, both age and trial type also predicted children’s
recall of the work expended. Children were better at
encoding numerical information when characters had
expended equal amounts of work.
Finally, we looked at predictors of Overall PAE. Age
significantly predicted Overall PAE, F(1,55) = 24.32, p <
.001, and Cognitive Control did not (once accounting for
age; p = 0.42). Therefore, numerical accuracy and cognitive
control were dissociable, despite both getting better with
age. 1
We next investigated whether these age-related
differences in encoding accuracy might explain age-related
changes in children’s resource allocation decisions. Because
children ignored starting opportunities, we do not further
consider the Starting Opportunity PAE. Recall that each
child could be coded as giving either an “equal split”,
“merit-based split”, or neither split (“other”). For the
separate analyses we coded these as equal split or not and
merit-based split or not.
We first looked at predictors of equal sharing. Preliminary
analyses revealed significant interactions between various
predictors for the trial types. Therefore, we first considered
the equal work trials only. We ran two mixed binary logistic
regression models using equal sharing as a response variable
and Age, Work Expended PAE, Overall PAE and Cognitive
1

In order to avoid biasing the results with children who were
responding with nonsensical numbers, we excluded responses on
which PAE scores were over 500% (n = 2) for this analysis.

1767

Control as the predictors.2 The critical question was whether
either Work Expended PAE or Cognitive Control might
predict children’s equal resource allocation.
As shown in Table 2, in the Equal Work Expended trials,
Cognitive Control and Overall PAE (general numerical
memory - the average error across the 32 questions asked)
predicted children’s equal sharing behavior. Once Cognitive
Control and Overall PAE were accounted for, there was no
longer any significant effect of age. Therefore, both
cognitive control and general numerical memory explained
age-related changes in sharing resources equally.
We then looked at predictors of merit-based allocation.
As shown in Table 2, Work Expended PAE was related to
the propensity to split resources meritoriously, but cognitive
control and Overall PAE were not. Age continued to be
related to the propensity to make merit-based splits.

The Table 2 results suggest two things: first, cognitive
control and general numerical accuracy predicted
propensity to make equal splits. Second, trial specific
numerical accuracy for work expended (ability to properly
encode merit-based information specifically) predicted
children’s abilities to make merit-based splits on trials that
called for merit-based splits (i.e., trials in which characters
produced unequal splits). Both sets of results held when
controlling for age, suggesting that age-related changes in

Because Overall PAE and Work Expended PAE were highly
collinear and conceptually and empirically confounded, we ran
separate models using each PAE type (see Table 2).

equal sharing may be explained by changes in cognitive
control and numerical accuracy, and that age-related
changes in merit-based sharing may be partly explained by
changes in encoding of merit-based information.

Discussion
Recent work has taken an interest in the cognitive
predictors of fairness. Our findings are consistent with prior
work showing a mostly equality-based principle during the
preschool age shifting to a merit-based principle by middle
childhood. We extend these findings by showing that 6 and
7-year olds actively create merit-based distributions even
when making equal allocations is a viable alternative. Most
importantly, we point to two cognitive predictors of sharing
behavior: children’s numerical encoding ability, and their
emerging cognitive control, each of which exerted a unique
effect on children’s abilities to make resource allocations.
One possibility for why young children often do not
employ merit-based resource allocations may be that they
fail to encode trial-specific numerical information to begin
with. Our findings show that this may be the case: encoding
accuracy for the amount of work that each character
expended predicted merit-based resource distribution on
trials that called for such distribution. Interestingly,
numerical encoding accuracy for starting opportunity
information did not predict allocations based on this
information. Thus, 6- and 7-year olds specifically encoded
information about starting opportunity but did not use this
information when allocating resources.
The effect of numerical accuracy held even when
controlling for changes in age and cognitive control. Prior
work has found that, in third-party unequal work tasks,
younger children can and do distribute resources according
to merit but under simplified conditions such as when an
unequal allocation is the only option (Baumard et al., 2012).
Three- and 5-year olds are also capable of using merit in
first person distributions but the strategies used vary widely
(Kanngiesser & Warneken, 2012).We propose that these
individual differences may be explained by differences in
the ability to accurately encode numerical information
inherent in meritocratic situations.
In contrast to the cognitive processes for merit-based
allocations, equal allocation decisions depended on general
numerical encoding. This result falls in line with prior work
finding that general numerical cognition (i.e., counting
ability) predicts equal sharing among preschool-aged
children (Chernyak et al., 2016). General numerical
accuracy and counting ability may tap into the same
underlying construct of numerical fluency and
understanding of numbers, which may then help children
with creating equal sets of resources.
We also found that children’s emerging cognitive control
predicted equal, but not merit-based, allocations across all
trial types. This suggests that cognitive control serves as a
general behavioral tool that allows children to choose equal
outcomes in spite of inequalities present in the scenarios.
One possibility for why this might be the case is that older

1768

children have acquired and might therefore need to inhibit
other potential principles (e.g., merit) in order to enact the
equality. Alternatively, cognitive control may simply help
children ensure that two equal sets have been created. Most
importantly, cognitive control failed to predict merit-based
resource distribution, suggesting a dissociation between the
types of cognitive mechanisms required for equality and
merit-based resource allocation.
Few children used the information about starting
opportunities, despite encoding this information. Although
work has found that children are able to make evaluations of
others’ work based on their starting opportunity (McCrink et
al., 2010; Ng et al., 2011), to our knowledge, there is no
current work that has shown that children then use those
evaluations to make resource allocation decisions. We
therefore propose that children may be well aware of
existing inequalities, but do not actively use such
information when making resource allocation decisions.
Overall, our work points to two important cognitive
predictors for different fairness principles. We propose that
searching for individual differences in children’s cognitive
abilities may help account for and ultimately shape their
social preferences.
