Evidence of Positivity Bias and Small Effect Sizes
Across Joint Simon Studies
Prior to analysis, a funnel plot revealed an extremely
positive and imprecise effect size (from Dolk et al., 2012,
see data point in bottom right corner of Figure 1A) which
was removed from all subsequent analyses.
   Figure 1A shows the distribution of joint Simon task
effect sizes as a function of the standard error in each study
(n = 94). Even with the Dolk et al. (2012) data point

positive skew in these data, t(92) = 3.25, p = .002, indicating
significant bias, with more small, positive studies being
