Results
The general trend is that the highest unlabeled precisions are
found in the upper right corners of the contour maps whereas
the lowest unlabeled precisions tend to lie close to the x-axis.
The dimensionality of the embedding space can be
interpreted as the granularity of children’s representations.
   The result of the alignments is demonstrated graphically in
Figures 1 and 2. In the alignments from CS to CDS and CS
to COCA, the CS-COCA alignment achieves only 50% to
60% of the unlabeled precision of the CS-CDS alignment.                Figure 2 Unlabeled accuracies of CS-CDS and CS-COCA

Results
The alignment precisions shown in Figure 3 show a clear
advantage of high-degree and medium degree conditions
over the low degree condition, but both high-degree and low-
degree have below random performances. We can also see an
advantage of medium degree initialization, which is parallel
to the basic level categorization theories. When we use a
mixed set of high-degree and medium-degree verbs, we get
the best results on all the conditions, which suggests that a
diverse-degree initialization facilitates semantic space
alignment.
