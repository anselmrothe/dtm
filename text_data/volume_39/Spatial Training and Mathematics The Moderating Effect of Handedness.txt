experiment. The mean age of the participants was 7.61 years
(SD = 0.89). Parental consent was asked and obtained for all
the participants.
Materials
The participants were administered (a) the Edinburgh
Handedness Inventory (EHI),2 (b) a spatial ability task
(mental rotation and translation) suitable for children (score
range 0 – 16; Ehrlich et al., 2006), and (c) a test of arithmetic,
designed by the experimenters (score range 0 – 27; Cronbach
Alpha = .96).
   EHI is a multiple-item questionnaire that provides a
continuous measure of handedness (h), which is calculated
using the formula              , where R and L indicate the
number of preferences for the right and left hand,
respectively. The range of values is between -1, for extreme
left-handedness, and +1, for extreme right-handedness. The
participants were categorized according to their h-values
                                                                     Figure 1. Two examples of the items used in the spatial test

                                                                                       (translation and rotation).
        a) Extreme right-handers: h ≥ .90 (N = 48).
        b) Moderate right-handers: .40 < h < .90 (N = 81).
        c) Non-right-handers: h ≤ .40 (N = 30).
   The test of mental rotation and translation ability consists
of 16 items. The participant is shown four whole pictures and
two parts of a flat shape. The participant has to mentally put
the two pieces together and choose one of the four whole
pictures (Figure 1).
   In the test of arithmetic, finally, the participants solved
simple mathematical equations (e.g., 3 + 4 = ?) and missing-
term problems (e.g., 3 + ? = 7).
Design
All the nine classes were pre-tested in arithmetic, spatial
ability (rotation/translation), and EHI. A week later, the nine
classes were randomly assigned to three groups:
      a) Three classes (one first-, one second-, one third-
