excellent company (e.g., There is an excellent welfare
program in company Y.), to persuade participants to have a
positive impression of the ingredient “proten.” The other text
had characteristics of an evil company (e.g., There is no
welfare program in company Y.), and persuaded participants
to have negative impressions toward the ingredient “rubison.”
One of the two texts was presented to each participant. Then,
the participants answered the same questionnaire as used in
the former session, in which they were asked to give their
impressions of the ingredient “proten” or “rubison.”
