                             Results
Across our two studies, we have 6 distinct measures for
which we examine change over time. For each of these
measures, we conducted both an absolute and a directional
comparison of the three types of change (predicted, actual,
and recalled). Overall, we found that people predicted future
improvement, but systematically neglected the possibility of
future decline. This resulted in both an overall
underestimation of mean absolute future change and an
overestimation of mean future improvement. In contrast,
people were more balanced in recall, remembering both

Net Directional Change We conducted a directional
analysis that accounts for valence, treating net increases in
all measures as improvements and net decreases as declines
(based on the results of our pre-test). On average across our
measures people predicted more positive future change than
they subsequently remembered (mean d=0.30, p<.001). Our
analysis also revealed a tendency to predict more positive
net future improvement than actually occurred (mean
d=0.22, p<.001). In contrast, people’s recall of past
improvement was more variable. Although in Study 1,               Figure 5. Decomposing directional change in Study 1 into
