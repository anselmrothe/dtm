Abstract
We investigated people’s assessments of their own personal
change over time, comparing predicted, actual, and recalled
change in personality, values, and performance. On average,
participants underestimated the absolute magnitude of their
personal change in both prediction and recall. However, people
specifically neglected negative future change, resulting in overly
optimistic predictions of improvement. In contrast, recall of
positive and negative change was relatively more balanced, such
that assessments of past improvement were better calibrated on
average. Our findings provide insight into how people think
about their own identity over time and address disparate theories
in the literature regarding predictions of personal stability versus
improvement.

Introduction
Imagine yourself ten years in the future. Will you be
nearly the same person you are today, just with grayer
hair? Or will you be a significantly changed person with
different abilities, values, and personality characteristics?
If you will have changed, will you have improved,
becoming wiser and kinder, or will you have taken a turn
for the worse, ending up lazy and irresponsible?
A large literature on beliefs about personal change
suggests that people tend to perceive a trajectory of
improvement in their own lives. People claim to possess
more desirable characteristics in the present than they did
in the past (Wilson & Ross, 2001), and think they will
continue to get even better in the future (Haslam, Bastian,
Fox, & Whelan, 2007; Kanten & Teigen, 2008). They
even expect basic personality traits to improve over most
of their lifespan (Krueger & Heckhausen, 1993), despite
some evidence indicating that these traits are mostly
unchanging (e.g., Costa & McCrae, 1989).
Expectations of improvement over time have been
associated with people’s normative theories about
personal identity. For example, Newman, Bloom, &
Knobe (2014) find that when evaluating change in others,
people associate improvements, but not declines, with a
person’s core identity, or “true self.” In this view, positive
change is a natural part of human development. Other
work highlights the finding that people consistently
predict greater personal improvement for themselves than
for others (e.g., Haslam et al., 2007, Kanten & Teigen,
2008), suggesting possible self-enhancement motives.

However, separate lines of research suggest that people
view their own identity as stable over time. Loewenstein,
O’Donoghue, & Rabin (2003) describe a systematic
tendency to overestimate the degree to which one’s own
preferences will persist into the future. More recently,
Quoidbach, Gilbert, & Wilson (2013) described an “End
of History” illusion. In this framework, people reported
more change in the past than they anticipated for the
future in various domains, possibly due to the difficulty of
envisioning new changes in prospect.
It is unclear how to reconcile findings related to belief
in self-improvement with research suggesting people
underestimate personal change more generally. Do people
in fact think that they have stopped changing, or do they
believe the biggest improvements are yet to come?
Because many studies highlighting people’s difficulty in
projecting future change have used changes with no
obvious direction (e.g., preference change), these have not
been directly connected to ideas about improvement or
decline. Are these two effects (expectations of
improvement and perceptions of stability) in fact
conflicting, or do they co-exist? Furthermore, many
studies of personal change over time examine either
perceptions or actual change, but not both. Are people’s
predictions and recall of change well-calibrated with their
actual change, or do they diverge?
We address these questions by examining both absolute
and directional personal change using a repeated
measures longitudinal design. Although Quoidbach et al.
(2013) found that one sample of people tended to predict
less future personal change than the other sample
remembered experiencing in the past, the study did not
assess actual change in individuals over time. In the
current studies, we measure and directly compare
predicted, actual, and recalled change within each of our
samples of young adults. We use actual change as a
baseline to determine whether any observed differences
between predicted and remembered change are due to
biases in estimating future change, distorted memories of
past change, or both. Furthermore, we use measures of
personality, values, and ability that allow us to examine
change both in magnitude and direction.
Our findings reconcile potentially conflicting
viewpoints in the literature by suggesting that although
people do underestimate the magnitude of their own
change, this finding is moderated by the valence of

change (i.e., whether the change is positive or negative).
Averaging across our measures, we find that people are
fairly well-calibrated in recall, but specifically
underappreciate the potential for future decline. Because

agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and
openness) and judging how much they thought this trait
applied to them. Ratings of current, predicted and
remembered personality were reported using a 0-100 slider
scale for each trait. In Study 2, participants again completed
this 5-item personality measure, and also completed a
previously validated 10-item measure with a 7-point
response scale (TIPI; Gosling, Rentfrow, & Swann, 2003;
also used in Quoidbach et al., 2013).1

Methods
We compared predicted, actual, and recalled personal
change over time in two panel surveys of young adults, who
completed all measures online. Study 1 assessed 155
participants (60% female, mean age=22.1) in December
2013 (Time 1) and December 2014 (Time 2), and Study 2
assessed 203 participants (73% female, mean age=22.6) in
May 2016 (Time 1) and September 2016 (Time 2). Study 2
was a conceptual replication that addressed several
additional questions raised by the results of Study 1. (Key
differences between the two studies are indicated in the
“Measures” section). For Study 1, college students (in any
year of college) were recruited from across the United States
using an online panel. In Study 2, participants were
graduating college seniors recruited by the experimenters.
Although the time period measured in Study 2 (4 months)
was shorter than that in Study 1 (1 year), all participants in
Study 2 would be undergoing a major life change (i.e.,
college graduation) during the study period, making it
plausible that significant changes in personality and values
could occur between the two assessments.
In both studies, we measured change in personality traits
and values, and in Study 2 we also measured change in
performance on an objective (knowledge) task. Personality
and values are viewed as important psychological
determinants of personal identity (Bartels & Rips, 2010;
Chen, Urminsky, & Bartels, 2016) and have been used in
previous research on perceptions of personal change
(Quoidbach et al., 2013). We chose these constructs rather
than other personal attributes (such as preferences) because
change in personality, values, and performance can be
measured both directionally (increase vs. decrease) as well
as in terms of absolute difference. The performance measure
is included to verify that our findings are replicable in a
domain where actual change is measured objectively rather
than by taking a difference in self-report measures.
Participants provided current measures of personality and
values (and performance, in Study 2) at both Time 1 and
Time 2. At Time 1, they also predicted what their responses
would be at Time 2. At Time 2, they provided their
recollection of their responses at Time 1. Reports of current
values were always made before reports of predicted or
recalled values.

Measures

Values Values were assessed using a 10-item version of the
Schwartz Value Inventory (Lindeman & Verkasalo, 2005;
also used in Quoidbach et al., 2013), measuring the personal
importance of self-direction, stimulation, hedonism,
achievement, power, security, conformity, tradition,
benevolence, and universalism. Current, predicted, and
remembered value importance ratings were measured on a
9-point scale.
Performance In Study 2, participants also answered ten
factual multiple-choice questions at each time point (e.g.,
“How many of the world’s tallest buildings are located in
the United States?”). Both sets of 10 questions were pretested to ensure that they were of similar difficulty and that
there were no floor or ceiling effects. At Time 1,
participants reported perceptions of their current and future
performance, and at Time 2 they reported their perceived
current and past performance.

Pre-Test to Determine Valence of Change
We used a separate online sample (N=100; 41% female,
mean age=34.3) to assess how people generally view
increases and decreases in the characteristics of interest. For
each personality dimension and value, participants used a 0100 scale to separately report how they would feel
(0=extremely displeased, 50=neither pleased nor
displeased, 100=extremely pleased) if the given
characteristic were to increase and decrease. For each of the
five personality dimensions as well as 9 out of 10 values,
the average response was significantly greater than 50 for
increases (suggesting people consider increases to be
desirable) and significantly less than 50 for decreases
(suggesting people consider decreases to be undesirable).2
Accordingly, for our basic directional analyses, we treat
personality and value increases as improvements, and
decreases as declines.
In Study 2 (after all other measures were completed), we
also asked individual participants to report whether they
viewed each personality or value change as an improvement
or decline, in order to better account for individual variation
in these beliefs. Coding each individual’s changes as
improvements and declines based on their own assessments

Personality In Study 1, participants completed a 5-item
personality assessment that involved reading a short
description of each Big Five dimension (i.e., extraversion,

week test-retest reliabilities (from separate sample, N =
215): r = 0.795 (5-item measure) and r = 0.923 (10-item measure).

did not significantly differ from the scale midpoint of 50, was
excluded, though overall results do not change if it is included.

rather than the mean assessment from the pretest did not
change the overall pattern of our results. However, future
research can further explore the effect of individual
differences in perceptions of valence of these
characteristics, as well as perceived differences in the
magnitude of their importance.

Change Calculation
We quantify change in two different ways, looking at both
absolute change and directional change. Absolute change
(i.e., the absolute difference between an item at Time 2 and
Time 1) represents deviation from the present state, ignoring
direction. Averaging absolute change across items captures
the distinction between variability (high values indicating
large changes in any direction) and stability (low values
indicating little change). This approach was taken in some
prior work, including Quoidbach et al. (2013).
However, looking only at absolute change neglects the
fact (confirmed in our valence pre-test) that increases and
decreases generally differ in desirability. For example, an
increase in creativity might be considered an improvement,
but a decrease of equivalent magnitude might be a decline.
Measuring only absolute change obscures this distinction.
We therefore also computed measures of directional
change (i.e., directional difference in Time 2 minus Time 1
ratings). Averaging across individual items thereby captures
the distinction between overall improvement (high positive
values indicating net positive change), overall stasis (nearzero values indicating no net change), and overall decline
(high negative values indicating net negative change).
In our analyses of personal change, we compare the
following: (i) predicted change (difference between future
prediction provided at Time 1 and current rating provided at
Time 1), (ii) actual change (difference between current
rating provided at Time 2 and current rating provided at
Time 1), and (iii) remembered change (difference between
current rating provided at Time 2 and past recollection
provided at Time 2). Using both absolute and directional
measures allows us to examine a) whether participants
perceive a smaller absolute magnitude of personal change
than they actually undergo over time and b) whether
participants overestimate their net improvement over time,
for both prediction and recall.

underestimated the magnitude of past change, they did not
express a directional bias in recall.
Although the overall pattern of our results supports this
finding, results across measures and studies were highly
variable. We report weighted mean effect sizes (Cohen’s d)
across all studies in the text of the paper to summarize our
overall findings, and present figures depicting the findings
of each individual measure to capture the variability across
them.
Absolute Change Across our six domains of measurement,
we found significant differences in absolute magnitude
between predicted, actual, and recalled change. Overall,
participants predicted that they would undergo less personal
change in the future than they recalled undergoing in the
past (mean d=-0.18, p<.001), which replicates previous
findings (Quoidbach et al., 2013). However, this effect was
small in comparison to their larger tendency to
underestimate the magnitude of both past (mean d=-0.51,
p<.001) and future (mean d=-0.72, p<.001) change relative
to actual change. This general pattern was found in all
absolute measures except for the 10-item personality
measure used in Study 2 (see left hand side of Figures 1-4).

Results
Across our two studies, we have 6 distinct measures for
which we examine change over time. For each of these
measures, we conducted both an absolute and a directional
comparison of the three types of change (predicted, actual,
and recalled). Overall, we found that people predicted future
improvement, but systematically neglected the possibility of
future decline. This resulted in both an overall
underestimation of mean absolute future change and an
overestimation of mean future improvement. In contrast,
people were more balanced in recall, remembering both
positive and negative past change. Thus, although people

Individual-level “Improvers” and “Decliners” How do
we explain the fact that on average, participants
simultaneously predicted less absolute change and greater
improvement than they actually experienced? To better
understand the observed mean-level effects, we separated
individuals based on whether they exhibited an overall
increase versus decrease in their predicted, remembered, and
actual change. For most of our measures across both studies
1 and 2, actual directional change across the sample was
near zero. However, this was not because people had
remained stable (as evidenced by the large absolute change
findings); rather, the sample was evenly split into those who
had experienced net improvement and those who had
experienced net decline of equal magnitude.3 In contrast,
predicted change was significantly positive for each
measure because fewer individuals predicted that they
would decline over the study period, and those that did so
reported declines of significantly smaller magnitude than the
average decline experienced. Figure 5 illustrates this pattern
using the personality and value measures from Study 1.

Net Directional Change We conducted a directional
analysis that accounts for valence, treating net increases in
all measures as improvements and net decreases as declines
(based on the results of our pre-test). On average across our
measures people predicted more positive future change than
they subsequently remembered (mean d=0.30, p<.001). Our
analysis also revealed a tendency to predict more positive
net future improvement than actually occurred (mean
d=0.22, p<.001). In contrast, people’s recall of past
improvement was more variable. Although in Study 1,
participants recalled greater improvement in personality and
values than they had experienced, recalled improvement
was either equal to or less than actual improvement for all
measures in Study 2 (right hand side of Figures 1-4). Across
all measures in Studies 1 and 2, average recall of past
directional change was not significantly different from
actual change (mean d=-0.03, p=.377).

participants on average experienced greater positive net change
over the study period, substantially deviated from this pattern.

We then performed separate analyses on those who had
actually improved versus those who declined. This revealed
that the underestimation of absolute magnitude of change at
the sample level in fact comes disproportionately from those
participants who are underpredicted their actual decline
(rather than from those who underpredicted their actual
improvement). Although similar patterns are observed for
each of our measures, we describe the 5-item personality
measure from Study 1 in detail to illustrate the form of this
effect. Participants who experienced an actual net decline in
the measured traits over the year (M=-12.25, SD=11.65) had
instead predicted a mean personality improvement of +3.62
(SD=6.67). The difference between these two numbers
reflects a significant directional overprediction of
improvement by 15.87 scale points, t(77)=10.87, 95%
CI=[12.96,18.78], d=1.23, p<.001. Nevertheless, the
absolute magnitude of their predicted change was still
smaller than the absolute magnitude of their actual change
(i.e., 3.62 vs. 12.25; t(77)=5.47, 95% CI=[5.48, 11.77],
d=0.62, p<.001). This yields an underprediction of change
when future change is defined only in terms of absolute
deviation from zero. In contrast, those who experienced an
actual net personality improvement (M=+13.07, SD=11.44)
had predicted an improvement of +7.73 (SD=7.76). This
reflects an underestimation of both their directional
improvement and their absolute change by 5.34 scale points,
t(76)=4.05, 95% CI=[2.72, 7.97], d=0.55, p<.001.
Comparing the size of these prediction errors reveals that
actual decliners made significantly larger errors on average
than actual improvers (i.e., 15.87 vs. 5.34); t(152)=5.35,
95% CI=[6.64, 14.42], d=0.86, p<.001. As a result, we
observe an overall improvement bias in the sample, given
that the errors made by decliners were biased in the
direction of positive change. Figure 6 provides a graphical
depiction of this phenomenon.

Figure 6: Comparison of actual (x-axis) versus predicted (yaxis) personality change (Study 1). Each point on this graph
represents an individual participant from Study 1, with black
dots representing those who actually declined over the
period and white circles representing those who improved.

The light gray line represents the line y=x (actual
improvement or decline=predicted improvement or decline),
which is where each point would fall if predictions were
completely accurate. The black line is the regression line
relating predicted and actual improvement as fitted from the
data. The discrepancy between the black and gray lines to
the left of the y-axis illustrates the overprediction of
improvement in those who actually declined, and the
discrepancy on the right side of the graph illustrates the
(smaller) underprediction of improvement in those who
actually improved.
The finding that those who actually declined
underpredicted their decline to a greater extent than
improvers underpredicted their improvement was observed
across all measures: personality (t(152)=5.35, 95%
CI=[6.64, 14.42], d=0.86, p<.001) and values (t(142)=4.53,
95% CI=[0.31, 0.80], d=0.73, p<.001) in Study 1, and both
5-item (t(111) =4.02, 95% CI=[3.02, 8.88], d =.65; p <.001)
and 10-item (t(169)=7.82, 95% CI=[0.51, 0.86], d =1.17; p
<.001) personality measures, values (t(182) = 2.95, 95%
CI=[.09, .47], d =.43; p = .004), and performance (t(152) =
2.56, 95% CI=[.14, 1.09], d = .40, p = .011) in Study 2.
However, there was no consistent finding in errors related to
recall across studies. In Study 1, those who actually declined
made larger errors than those who actually improved for
measures of both personality and values. In contrast, across
measures in Study 2, actual improvers made errors of
equivalent or greater size as actual decliners did in recall.

Discussion
Overall, the results of our two longitudinal studies reveal
that people predict smaller absolute change in personality,
values, and performance than they actually experience.
However, a directional analysis of the data reveals that this
discrepancy is specifically driven by a neglect of negative
change. Although on average people experience both
improvements and declines over time, they incorrectly
predict that their future will consist mainly of
improvements. Rather than being the end of their personal
trajectory, the present moment represents a watershed of a
different sort: the moment when people think a somewhat
rocky past resolves into a consistent upward climb. Our
findings suggest that looking only at the absolute magnitude
of change may obscure important aspects of people’s beliefs
about their own personal change.
Although people do underestimate the magnitude of their
future change, our directional measures reveal that this is
not generally caused by expectations of stability in personal
characteristics. Rather, at the sample level, those who
worsened over our study period were disproportionately
likely to have neglected the possibility of decline and
instead predicted some smaller level of improvement. Thus,
the apparent magnitude effect seems to be driven by a
general tendency to overestimate improvement, which is
consistent with prior research suggesting that people expect
the continued development and emergence of positive

2752

personal characteristics (Haslam et al., 2007; Newman et al.,
2014). Previous work also suggests that although people are
able to distinguish their future expectations from
conceptions of their ideal self, predictions are nonetheless
likely to be influenced by aspirations (Molouki & Bartels,
2017). This may be one mechanism underlying the observed
overpredictions of improvement.
Although we found that people overpredicted future
improvement, on the whole, we did not find this effect in
recall of past change. This may be because past recall is
more constrained by reality and episodic facts than future
prospection (Kane, McGraw, & Van Boven, 2009), making
people more likely to acknowledge that past decline has
occurred even if this was counter to their expectations.
However, other research suggests that people do revise their
perceptions of the past towards a trajectory of improvement
(e.g., Wilson & Ross, 2001). Although we did find that
people overestimated past improvement in Study 1, this
pattern did not emerge in Study 2. Further research is
needed to explore the source of this heterogeneity (and the
large heterogeneity across our measures more broadly), by
examining effects of contextual factors such as length of
time span, intervening life events, dimension of change, and
timing of measurement. In particular, a more careful
investigation of our personality measures is needed, as some
discrepancies were noted between the 5-item and 10-item
personality scales used.
In addition to providing a reconciliation of previous
findings about perceptions of stability versus improvement,
the current work makes an important contribution more
broadly to a growing body of literature on people’s theories
of the nature and persistence of personal identity. Existing
research in this area has suggested that people endorse
normative theories about a fundamentally good essence that
forms the core of one’s identity and will be revealed over
time (Molouki & Bartels, 2017; Newman et al., 2014;
Newman, De Frietas, & Knobe, 2015; Strohminger, Knobe,
& Newman, in press; Tobia, 2015). The current research
explicitly demonstrates that predictions of personal
improvement are more pronounced than actual improvement
over time. This finding lends empirical support to the idea
that predictions may be influenced by normative beliefs that
diverge from a purely descriptive account of personal
development. Furthermore, we noted new findings about
different patterns of prediction error for those who in fact
improved versus declined over the study period. Future
research can further explore the interactions between
specific developmental trajectories and beliefs about
personal identity.
