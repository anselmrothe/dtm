were computed over all participants. A 100 ms. pre-tone
period was used as the baseline. Only trials without mus-
cle artefact or eye movement/blink activity were included in
the averaging process. The analyses were based on 15 chan-
nels divided into five separate parasagittal columns along the
anteroposterior axis of the head. The columnar approach to
analysing the ERP data provides both an anterior-to-posterior
as well as a left/right comparison of ERP effects. The elec-

F3/F4, C3/C4, P3/P4; Outer column: F7/F8, T3/T4, T5/T6)

three separate ANOVAs. The analysis of the midline column
included the position factor (position 1 vs. position 2 vs. posi-
tion 3) and the location factor with three levels (Fz vs. Cz vs.
Pz). The analyses of the two pairs of lateral columns involved

positions. All post-hoc analyses were Bonferroni corrected.
