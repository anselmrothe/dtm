recognition of the Apple logo), participants were instructed
to put away all cellphones and other electronic devices before
the experiment began. First, participants completed the
demographic questionnaire (Figure 2, first panel). Next,
participants answered 27 questions, one at a time, which
consisted of three parts: 1) participants responded to each
question by selecting one of the 3-AFCs from a drop-down
menu 2) participants rated their level of confidence in their
answer on a seven point Likert scale, with one being not
confident at all and seven being very confident 3) participants
indicated from a drop-down menu if and how they had
previously been exposed to the information presented in the
question. The options included: “I recently discussed this
with a friend", "I have seen the TV show/movie, read the
book/play, or heard the song/phrase before”, "I have not seen
the TV show/movie, read the book/play, or heard the song,
but I have seen this referenced elsewhere", "I have never seen       Figure 3: Response probabilities for the target and
