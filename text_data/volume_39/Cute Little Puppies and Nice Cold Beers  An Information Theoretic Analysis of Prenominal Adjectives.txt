—set of nouns following gender-marked determiners.
Consistent with this thesis, when Dye et al. (2017)
compared singular nouns in German (which are marked for
gender), with plural nouns (which are not), they found that
singular nouns following determiners were significantly
more lexically diverse than their plural counterparts.
  By comparison, English determiners, which are neither
gender nor case-specific, have less potential to be
informative about their following nouns. Consider that
while the determiner the in English is informative about the
type of word that will follow (a noun, most likely), in
German, the determiners der, die, das, den, dem, and des
convey not only part of speech information, but also
delineate the specific set of lexical items that can follow.
This suggests that English determiners may not support the
same level of lexical diversity available in German.
                                                                     !
  To examine this possibility, we first compared the
conditional entropy of German nouns following articles                 Figure 1: To illustrate the relationship between entropy,

adjectives are also common prenominally, and may serve a
similar function.
   To further explore this idea, we compared the adjective-
noun sequences in the ukWaC and the SdeWaC corpora.
Both the overall proportion of adjectives (tp = 1992.336; p <
.0001) and the probability of a noun being preceded by an
adjective (tp = 85.088; p < .0001) were significantly higher
in English than in German. While German nouns are
significantly more lexically diverse than their English
counterparts, precisely the opposite obtains for adjectives.
   These results present us with two different theoretical
explanations. One possibility is that English speakers use
more adjectives overall to compensate for the use of less                          Figure 3: Adjective maximum entropy, which provides an upper

speakers use an equally diverse set of nouns, but rely on
adjectives—rather than determiners—to facilitate the use of
more informative nouns. Fortunately, these accounts make
competing predictions, allowing us to distinguish between
them empirically.
   The first account accords well with the taxonomic
assumption that adjectives add semantic detail to nouns, or
somehow “modify” their semantic content (Kamp & Partee,
1995). On this assumption, adjectives should preferentially
modify high frequency nouns, which are in greater need of
semantic augmentation, over low frequency nouns, which
