                               Abstract
   We report the results of a large-scale (N=1571) experiment to
   investigate whether spoken words can emerge from the process
   of repeated imitation. Participants played a version of the chil-
   dren’s game “Telephone”. The first generation was asked to
   imitate recognizable environmental sounds (e.g., glass break-
   ing, water splashing); subsequent generations imitated the im-
   itators for a total of 8 generations. We then examined whether
   the vocal imitations became more stable and word-like, re-
   tained a resemblance to the original sound, and became more
   suitable as learned category labels. The results showed (1) the
   imitations became progressively more word-like, (2) even af-
   ter 8 generations, they could be matched above chance to the
   environmental sound that motivated them, and (3) imitations
   from later generations were more effective as learned cate-
   gory labels. These results show how repeated imitation can
   create progressively more word-like forms while retaining a
   semblance of iconicity.
