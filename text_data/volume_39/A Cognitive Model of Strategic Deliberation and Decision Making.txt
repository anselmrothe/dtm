the game is symmetric). Nash equilibrium predicts that
decision makers should ignore the boobytrap choice,
however the presence of the boobytrap greatly increases the
rate of cooperation in the game, contradicting the prediction
of Nash equilibrium.
   Yet another set of findings not accounted for by Nash
equilibrium theory involves strategy salience. In many
games, strategies with salient labels are more likely to be
chosen. This is the case in coordination games offering
multiple payoff identical strategies, with one of the
strategies circled, underlined, or made salient using some
other technique. Here players can coordinate successfully by
selecting the salient strategy (Mehta et al., 2004).
