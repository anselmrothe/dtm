role in capturing the behavioral patterns observed in
strategic choice. By demonstrating the relationship between
our model and established preference accumulation models,
we demonstrate that a single framework can be used to
understand choice behavior across a variety of non-strategic
and strategic settings.

Abstract
We study game theoretic decision making using a
bidirectional evidence accumulation model. Our model
represents both preferences for the strategies available to the
decision maker, as well as beliefs regarding the opponent’s
choices. Through sequential sampling and accumulation, the
model is able to intelligently reason through two-player
strategic games, while also generating specific violations of
Nash equilibrium typically observed in these games. The
main ingredients of accumulator models, stochastic sampling
and dynamic accumulation, play a critical role in explaining
these behavioral patterns as well as generating novel
predictions.

Game Theoretic Decision Making
In strategic games, two or more players make choices over a
set of strategies. Crucially, the strategies chosen by the
players collectively determine the outcomes of the game, so
that each player’s utility depends on the other’s choice as
well as on their own. We define a finite-strategy two-player
game with a set of pure strategies for each player, 𝑆1 =
{𝑠11 , … 𝑠1𝑁 } and 𝑆2 = {𝑠21 , … 𝑠2𝑀 } respectively, and a pair
of payoff functions 𝑢1 and 𝑢2 that give each player’s utility
for each profile of pure strategies (𝑠1𝑖 , 𝑠2𝑗 ). Thus if player 1
selects 𝑠1𝑖 and player 2 selects 𝑠2𝑗 the utility for player 1 is
𝑢1 (𝑠1𝑖 ; 𝑠2𝑗 ) and the utility for player 2 is 𝑢2 (𝑠2𝑗 ; 𝑠1𝑖 ), with
𝒖𝑖𝑗 = (𝑢1 (𝑠1𝑖 ; 𝑠2𝑗 ), 𝑢2 (𝑠2𝑗 ; 𝑠1𝑖 )). We define the set of best
responses for player µ to an opponent’s strategy 𝑠−µ as
BR(𝑠−µ ) = arg max 𝑢µ (𝑠µ ; 𝑠−µ ). Then a pure strategy
Nash equilibrium can be defined as a strategy profile
(𝑠1𝑖 , 𝑠2𝑗 ) such that 𝑠1𝑖 ∊ BR(𝑠2𝑗 ) and 𝑠2𝑗 ∊ BR(𝑠1𝑖 ).
There are a number of settings where Nash equilibrium
fails to accurately describe human behavior. For example,
Nash equilibrium predicts unraveling when players have
incentives to undercut each other. Consider the traveler’s
dilemma game (Basu, 1994), in which two travelers have
lost identical items and must request compensation. The
airline accepts the lower claim as valid and pays that
amount to both players, and, additionally penalizes the
higher claimant with a fee and rewards the lower claimant
with a bonus. We represent this game with the strategy sets
S1 = S2 = {20,30,…,90}, where x1i and x2j correspond to the
amounts (in dollars) associated with strategies s1i and s2j,
and we have utilities uij = (0.01(x2j – γ), 0.01(x2j + γ)) if x1i >
x2j, uij = (0.01x1j, 0.01x2j) if x1i = x2j, and uij = (0.01(x1j + γ),
0.01(x2j – γ)) if x1i < x2j. Here γ corresponds to the
reward/penalty offered by the airline, and is set so that 10 <
γ ≤ 20. For comparability with other games, we have scaled
utilities to lie between 0 and 1.
The airline’s scheme rewards undercutting the other
traveler. The best response is always to claim exactly 10
less than the other traveler does (if it is feasible to do so).

Introduction
Game theory studies the behavior of idealized decision
makers. The standard solution concept for a strategic game
is Nash equilibrium, which relies on common rationality
and accurate expectations. Given expectations of others’
choices, players behave rationally, and the resulting play
conforms to these expectations (Luce & Raiffa, 1957).
Not surprisingly, human decision makers display
numerous systematic departures from Nash equilibrium (see
Camerer, 2003 for a review). We present a cognitive model
of strategic deliberation and choice in one-shot, two-player
games, that is able to accommodate these departures. Our
model proposes that decision makers dynamically and
stochastically accumulate both their own preferences for
available strategies, as well as beliefs about the opponent’s
preferred strategies. There are bidirectional relationships
between preferences and beliefs, so that beliefs about what
the opponent will choose influence the decision makers’
preferences, and these preferences in turn influence beliefs
about the opponent’s choices. Ultimately, decision makers
can respond to what they think the opponent will do, and
also revise these beliefs as they deliberate.
Our model can be seen as an extension of decision field
theory (Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993; also Bhatia, 2014
and Rieskamp, 2006), an existing accumulator-based theory
of non-strategic risky choice. Accumulator models rely on
two main ingredients: stochastic sampling and dynamic
accumulation (see Busemeyer, 2015 for a review). These
ingredients are critical in our model for making deliberation
subject to intrinsic variability and requiring it to play out
over time, and we show that both ingredients have a central

421

As a result, the only Nash equilibrium strategy for both
players is to claim 20. In experiments average claims
actually are well above the lower bound that Nash
equilibrium predicts (e.g. Capra et al., 1999).
Experiments on the traveler’s dilemma game also find
that claims are higher when the reward/penalty, γ, is lower.
This payoff sensitivity is hard to reconcile with players
choosing best responses to the strategies they expect their
opponent to play. Nash equilibrium predicts that responses
in the traveler’s dilemma should be independent of γ, as
changing payoffs without changing best responses should
have no effect on choice behavior.
Another setting in which Nash equilibrium fails to
appropriately describe behavior involves coordination
games. These are games with multiple pure strategy Nash
equilibria, in which players are incentivized to choose the
same strategy. Due to the presence of multiple equilibria,
Nash theory cannot make precise predictions. However,
human decision makers are often fairly predictable.
Consider the Hi-Lo coordination game, in which decision
makers have to choose between two strategies: Hi and Lo.
In this game we have: uij = (1.0,1.0) if both players both
choose Hi; uij = (γ, γ), with 0 < γ < 1.0, if both plays choose
Lo; and uij = (0,0) if they choose different strategies. Not
surprisingly, decision makers almost always successfully
coordinate on Hi-Hi to obtain the highest possible rewards
in this game (Colman, 2003).
In some games, decision makers do not choose any of the
Nash equilibrium strategies when the potential costs of
miscoordination are too great. This can be observed in the
boobytrap game, which is a standard prisoner’s dilemma
augmented with a third option that allows decision makers
to purchase a “boobytrap” to punish their opponent if he or
she defects (Misyak & Chater, 2014). Particularly, we have
uij = (0.9,0.9) if both players cooperate, uij = (0.8,0.8) if both
players defect, and uij = (0.89,0.89) if both players choose
boobytrap. Additionally, uij = (0.7,1) if player 1 cooperates
and player 2 defects, uij = (0.9,0.89) if player 1 cooperates
and player 2 chooses boobytrap, and uij = (0,0.69) if player 1
defects and player 2 chooses boobytrap (and vice versa, as
the game is symmetric). Nash equilibrium predicts that
decision makers should ignore the boobytrap choice,
however the presence of the boobytrap greatly increases the
rate of cooperation in the game, contradicting the prediction
of Nash equilibrium.
Yet another set of findings not accounted for by Nash
equilibrium theory involves strategy salience. In many
games, strategies with salient labels are more likely to be
chosen. This is the case in coordination games offering
multiple payoff identical strategies, with one of the
strategies circled, underlined, or made salient using some
other technique. Here players can coordinate successfully by
selecting the salient strategy (Mehta et al., 2004).

Townsend, 1993). As in decision field theory, decision
makers use two layers of nodes: one to accumulate
preferences in favor of the available choice options, and one
to represent the probabilistic events involved in the decision.
In the strategic context, the choice options are the strategies
available to the decision maker and the events are the
possible strategies the opponent may use. Thus, the strength
of the connection from the node representing a strategy j for
the opponent to the node representing preference for a
decision maker’s strategy i, is proportional to the utility of
strategy i for the decision maker, given that the opponent
plays strategy j. Decision makers sample the events
according to the subjective probabilities they assign to their
occurrence. Thus, strategies that are more likely to be
played by the opponent are sampled more frequently and
thereby play a larger role in determining the decision
makers’ preferences.
Decision field theory assumes that decision makers’
beliefs about events (and subsequently sampling
probabilities for these events) are fixed. For the most part
this is reasonable: decision makers’ preferences do not
influence the actual probability with which different events
occur. This assumption is less reasonable in strategic
settings. Sophisticated opponents, who can anticipate
decision makers’ choices, will adjust their own choices to
maximize their reward. We thus assume a bidirectional
accumulation process to represent strategic deliberation. At
each time period, decision makers sample one of their
opponent’s strategies based on the activations of the nodes
corresponding to these strategies, and update their
preferences over their own strategies based on this sample.
Decision makers then sample one of their own strategies
based on the activation of the nodes, and use this sample to
update their beliefs about their opponent’s choices. In
essence, decision makers have dynamically changing mental
representations for not only their own preferences, but also
their beliefs about their opponents’ preferences, allowing
them to deliberate intelligently using perspective taking and
a sophisticated theory of mind.

Bidirectional Accumulation

We propose an extension to a preexisting accumulator
model of risky choice, decision field theory (Busemeyer &

422

Figure 2: Simulated distribution of choices in the traveler’s dilemma.

Formally, if the decision maker has to choose from the set
of strategies 𝑆1 = {𝑠11 , … 𝑠1𝑁 }, then the preference layer in
our model consists of N nodes, with node i representing
strategy 𝑠1𝑖 . The activation of node i at time t, A1i(t)
corresponds to the decision maker’s preference for strategy i
at time t. Correspondingly if the opponent has the set of
available strategies 𝑆2 = {𝑠21 , … 𝑠2𝑀 }, then the belief layer
in our model consists of M nodes, with node j representing
strategy 𝑠2𝑗 . The activation of node j at time t, A2j(t)
corresponds to the beliefs that the decision maker has about
the opponent’s preference for strategy j, at time t. We also
denote the salience bias of any strategy i (for the decision
maker) or j (for the opponent) as 𝜎1𝑖 or 𝜎2𝑗 . These salience
biases 𝜎1𝑖 and 𝜎2𝑗 are independent of the decision process
and are determined by various exogenous factors.
At each time period t, the decision maker draws one
sample of the opponent’s strategies. We assume that a
softmax (logit) function, with stochasticity parameter 𝜆 > 0,
determines the effect of activation strength and the
exogenous salience bias on sampling probability. Thus, the
probability of sampling strategy j at time t is given by: 𝑝𝑗 =
𝜆(𝐴2𝑘 (𝑡−1)+𝜎2𝑘 )
𝑒 𝜆(𝐴2𝑗 (𝑡−1)+𝜎2𝑗) ⁄∑𝑀
. If the opponent’s
𝑘=1 𝑒
strategy j is sampled, then the decision maker observes the
utility for each strategy i conditional on the opponent
playing this sampled strategy: 𝑢1 (𝑠1𝑖 ; 𝑠2𝑗 ). The decision
maker’s preferences are then updated based on this
calculated utility, so the activation for each strategy i
becomes: 𝐴1𝑖 (𝑡) = 𝐴1𝑖 (𝑡 − 1) + 𝑢1 (𝑠1𝑖 ; 𝑠2𝑗 ).
As discussed, beliefs about the opponent’s strategies are
themselves updated based on the utility the opponent would
derive conditional on a sample of the decision maker’s

strategies. Thus, after updating activation states A1i(t),
decision makers draw one sample of their own strategies.
The probability of sampling strategy i at time t is given by:
𝜆(𝐴1𝑘 (𝑡)+𝜎1𝑘 )
𝑞𝑖 = 𝑒 𝜆(𝐴1𝑖(𝑡)+𝜎1𝑖) ⁄∑𝑁
. After sampling
𝑘=1 𝑒
strategy i, the updated activation for each opponent strategy
j is 𝐴2𝑗 (𝑡) = 𝐴2𝑗 (𝑡 − 1) + 𝑢2 (𝑠2𝑗 ; 𝑠1𝑖 ).
The deliberation process begins with nodes having no
initial activation: A1i(0) = 0 for all i; A2j(0) = 0 for all j.
Activation accumulates according to these equations until a
time t = T. At this time, the most preferred strategy --that is,
the one whose node has the highest activation-- is the
strategy that is chosen by the decision maker. The parameter
T corresponds to an exogenous time limit on the
deliberation process, and represents the amount of time
taken by the decision makers to make their choices. The
proposed model is illustrated in Figure 1.

Explaining Behavioral Findings
In order to demonstrate how our model works, we use it to
simulate choices in the games we introduced earlier. Our
simulations use the same strategy and reward profiles as in
examples in the previous section. For each of the games and
each set of parameter values, we simulate our model 3000
times and report aggregate choice probabilities. We find that
the model is fairly robust to parameter variation in the range
𝜆 ∈ [0.25, 4] and 𝑇 ∈ [10, 30], and any combination of
parameter values in this range produces behavior consistent
with the empirical findings we have reviewed. When not
explicitly specified, we set salience to 𝜎1𝑖 = 𝜎2𝑗 = 0.
Traveler’s Dilemma. In the traveler’s dilemma our
model predicts a failure of unraveling. This is demonstrated
in Figure 2 which plots the probability of selecting

423

strategies in the set {20, 30, …, 90} for γ = 11 and γ = 19,
with varying values of 𝜆 and T. Instead of predicting that
players always claim the lowest possible amount, as in Nash
equilibrium, here the model generates a distribution of
choices that spreads across the range of strategies available
to the decision maker. The model also displays payoff
sensitivity. For a larger value of the reward/penalty
parameter (γ = 19), the distribution of choices is smaller.
The intuition behind the model’s predictions is appealing.
For low rewards/penalties, i.e. low values of γ, the payoffs
when both players make high claims are significantly higher
than the payoffs when there is a low claim. The potential
cost of missing out on this high payoff dwarfs the cost of
making a higher claim than the opponent or the benefit of
making a lower claim than the opponent. So, a few samples
(or even a single sample) of the opponent playing a high
claim will lead to high activation for one’s own high claims.
As beliefs about the opponent’s strategy are updated, there
will be more samples of high claims, and strategies
involving an additional step of undercutting can accumulate
the most utility. The number of steps of undercutting that
does occur depends on payoff magnitudes. Increasing the
parameter γ encourages undercutting. Although it does not
affect best responses (that is, the ranking of payoffs in any
given sample of play), it does affect the accumulation of
payoffs over time, so strategies involving more undercutting
can accumulate activation more quickly.
Stochastic sampling plays an important role in the
emergence of payoff sensitivity. The magnitudes of payoff
differences affect the probabilities of sampling each
strategy. The degree of responsiveness to the payoff
parameter γ that we observe in the predicted choices for this
game depends on the logit sampling parameter 𝜆.
Comparing across the columns of Figure 2, we see larger
shifts in the distribution of choices from a change in the
reward/penalty parameter γ as the parameter 𝜆 increases.
Our model also makes new predictions about the
relationship between decision time and the strategy chosen
in the traveler’s dilemma. Each step of undercutting takes
time, and thus both the decision maker’s preferred claim and
the beliefs about the opponent’s claim should thus decrease
over time. Comparing across the rows of Figure 2, we
observe lower claims when the decision time T is larger.
Indeed, experiments have revealed that decision makers take
longer to choose the lowest claim than the highest claim
(Rubinstein, 2007).
Overall, with reasonable parameter values, the model
predicts a failure of unraveling. Indeed, full unraveling,
consistent with Nash equilibrium would only occur with
very large values of 𝜆 and T, i.e., when poorly performing
strategies are rarely sampled and there are many periods of
sampling and iterative updating. Assuming deterministic
sampling of best responses or unlimited decision time would
thus lead to poor behavioral predictions for the traveler’s
dilemma. Conversely, assuming uniformly random
sampling would lead to unreasonably high odds of choosing
80 relative to 70, underestimating people’s ability to put

themselves in their opponents’ shoes and think strategically
about their responses.
The Hi-Lo Game. Although the Hi-Lo game has two
Nash equilibria, our model favors the Hi-Hi equilibrium.
This is shown in Figure 3, which plots the probability of
choosing Hi as a function of the payoff for coordinating on
Lo (γ) for varying values of T and λ. Across all parameter
values we consider, Hi is the modal choice. When the
payoff asymmetry is extreme, i.e., γ = 0.1, Hi is almost
certain to be chosen. Still, as the Lo-Lo payoff γ increases,
so does the probability of choosing Lo.
Predictable coordination in the Hi-Lo game is intuitive.
The Hi strategy, which offers higher payoffs in the case of
successful coordination, accumulates more activation when
it is sampled from the other layer of the network than the
low strategy does. This creates a feedback effect, so the
model is more likely to think about Hi when forming beliefs
about the opponent’s choices. Believing that the opponent
will choose Hi further reinforces the model’s preference Hi.
The positive feedback loop, along with stochastic
sampling, actually facilitates the occasional choices of Lo.
If Lo is sampled first, it gains an advantage, and it becomes
more likely to be sampled again. As the logit sampling
parameter λ increases, it becomes somewhat more likely
(albeit still not very likely) that the model repeatedly
samples Lo early on, gets fixated on this strategy, and
eventually chooses it. In the extreme case that the sampling
parameter λ gets unrealistically large, the strategy sampled
in the first time period may be sampled forever thereafter,
completely determining the path of the deliberation. Since
both strategies have the same probability of being sampled
in the first period of the deliberation, the model’s choice
distribution approaches a 50-50 split between Hi and Lo
independent of γ for very large values of λ. As can be seen,
decision time has little effect on the choice distribution, with
longer deliberation only slightly reducing noise and
increasing the probability of selecting the modal choice, Hi.
The Boobytrap Game. Our model deviates far from
Nash equilibrium in the boobytrap game as well. For 𝜆 ∈
[0.25, 4] and 𝑇 ∈ [10, 30], it predicts that players will
almost certainly cooperate (cooperation with a greater than
90% chance for all parameters). Here, a non-Nash strategy
is favored due to the high magnitude of its advantage when
the other player does not best respond compared to the low
magnitude of its cost when the other player does respond
rationally. Against the boobytrap strategy, defection is
extremely undesirable. The model predicts that players will
never choose the boobytrap strategy, because it is dominated
by cooperation. However, the model predicts that decision
makers usually will contemplate this boobytrap strategy as
part of their deliberation, and this causes their preferences
for defection to drop strongly.
Again, our model’s behavior would be very different with
an assumption of deterministic sampling of the most highly
activated strategy. With deterministic sampling, the model
is confident that the boobytrap strategy will not be played,
so it chooses to defect.

Salient Labels. Our model recognizes salience effects,
too. In the simple heads-or-tails coordination game with
heads being especially salient, such that 𝜎1H = 𝜎2H = 𝜍 and
𝜎1T = 𝜎2T = 0, we find that the probability of choosing
heads is increasing in its salience 𝜍, as shown in Figure 4.
This figure plots the probability of choosing heads in this
game as a function of the salience of heads, 𝜍, for varying
values of T and λ. As we should intuitively expect, when
sampling is less noisy, i.e., when λ is greater, the players are
more sensitive to salience. Specifically, when near the high
end of our range, i.e., 𝜆 = 4, if heads is sufficiently salient,
it is almost certain to be chosen. (In contrast, with an
assumption of uniformly random sampling, our model
would not account for any salience effect at all.)
Convergence occurs quickly, so we see few effects from
increasing the decision time T. Higher values of T only
slightly reduce noise and increase the choice probability of
heads when the logit sampling parameter 𝜆 is small.

findings from this paper, due to space constraints.
Our model is closely related to existing accumulator
theories choice, and we suggest that it can be seen as a
direct extension of decision field theory (Busemeyer &
Townsend, 1993; also see Busemeyer, 2015 for a review).
The novel element in our model involves the representation
of beliefs regarding opponent’s choices and the bidirectional
updating of both preferences and beliefs over the time
course of the decision process. Intuitively, bidirectional
feedback in the accumulation process allows decision
makers to base their choices on their beliefs about the
opponent’s choices, but also to update their beliefs as their
own preferences evolve. As this updating happens gradually
over time, the decision makers’ intended choices (and
beliefs about the opponent’s choices) get increasingly more
sophisticated the longer they spend deliberating. Eventually
the nodes for the opponent’s strategies develop unequal
activation, with strategies that are appropriate responses to
the decision maker’s preferences having higher activation.
Highly activated opponent strategies are more likely to be
sampled, and the decision maker is subsequently more likely
to develop preferences that intelligently respond to the
opponent’s anticipated choices.
Note that there is considerable evidence that decision
makers are able to represent the preferences and beliefs of
others separately from their own. Although the nature of
these representations is not typically studied in the context
of game theoretic deliberation, some experimental work on
theory of mind in strategic games does support our proposed
model. Hedden and Zhang (2002), for example, find that
players in sequential move games have sophisticated beliefs
about the opponent’s preferences, and that these beliefs are

Discussion
We have proposed a cognitive model of strategic
deliberation and decision making. Our model is able to
account for violations of Nash equilibrium involving
failures of unravelling, payoff sensitivity, predictable
coordination, and salience, and we illustrate this by
simulating our model on four different games. Note that
these violations have also been documented in a number of
additional
games,
including
the
minimum-effort
coordination game, the stag hunt game, the battle of sexes
game, the discoordination game, the 11-20 game, the hide
and seek game, the matching pennies game, and the Kreps
game. Elsewhere we show that our model makes realistic
behavioral predictions for all of these games, for 𝜆 ∈

425

dynamically modified based on the evidence presented to
the decision maker during the decision process. Goodie et
al. (2012) also find that players’ beliefs about their
opponent’s preferences are fairly complex, and are formed
in response to the players’ own preferences.
Our approach is also closely related to cognitive decision
modeling (in non-strategic settings) that uses neural
networks with recurrent connectivity (Glöckner et al., 2014;
Holyoak & Simon, 1999). Recurrence in these networks is
often bidirectional; the activation of cues and decision
attributes may influence and be influenced by beliefs and
preferences. The bidirectional feedback in the above models
and in ours is very similar, implying that our model could be
adapted for other cognitive decision modeling applications.
Our bidirectional accumulation model also bears some
resemblance to models of behavioral game theory, such as
level-k reasoning and logit quantal response equilibrium
(McKelvey & Palfrey, 1995; Nagel, 1995). In both our
model and in level-k reasoning, individuals engage in an
iterative process of deliberation that terminates before
reaching a point of self-consistency. Likewise, in both our
model and in logit quantal response equilibrium, individuals
use a stochastic logit response rule to consider responses,
thereby generating payoff sensitivity. However, unlike
these models, our approach implements the deliberation
process within a well-established psychological framework.
This allows our model to describe salience effects, while
also predicting the effects of time pressure and response
time. Our model also makes more realistic stochastic choice
predictions than either of these two existing theories: It
permits trial-to-trial variability in choice, while also
avoiding the selection of dominated strategies.
Our approach is also quite parsimonious. There are two
parameters in our model: the decision time parameter, T,
and the stochastic sampling parameter, λ. Decision time T
can be seen as controlling the extent of bidirectional
processing one can engage in during deliberation and thus
determining one’s level of strategic sophistication. Quick
decisions involve fairly limited reasoning, with choices
responding to simplistic beliefs about the opponent.
Decisions that are a product of extended deliberation, in
contrast, generate choices based on a more sophisticated
theory of mind. As in all accumulator models, decision time
also influences the amount of variability in the decision.
The stochastic sampling parameter λ can also be seen as
affecting the extent of bidirectional processing one engages
in. When λ is small, strategies are sampled with close to
uniform probability, and activation in one layer of the
network has little or no effect on the accumulation of
activation in the other layer of the network. As 𝜆 increases,
the decision maker becomes more and more likely to sample
the most preferred strategies. When λ is very large, the most
highly activated strategies are almost deterministically
sampled, so preferences and beliefs interact more strongly
during the deliberation.
Ultimately, the model’s key behavioral properties depend
critically on its dynamic and stochastic processes. Many

scholars have suggested that behavioral theories of decision
making can, with incorporation of these fundamental
cognitive processes, describe a wide range of behavior (e.g.
Busemeyer, 2015). Our results reinforce these claims by
demonstrating the explanatory power of stochastic sampling
and dynamic accumulation in strategic choice.
