   To summarize Figures 2 and 3, increasing the variance of
the coronal category causes an ideal listener to be more
likely to perceive a non-coronal signal ([g]) as an exemplar
of the coronal category (/d/), and less likely to perceive a
coronal signal ([d]) as an exemplar of the non-coronal
category (/g/). [g] can be a /d/ but [d] cannot be a /g/.
