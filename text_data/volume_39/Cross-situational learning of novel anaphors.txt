Learning Phase This experiment was implemented in
PsychoPy (Pierce, 2007). During the Learning Phase the
participant was presented with one picture-sentence trial at a
time. They were instructed to read the sentence aloud, and
take as long as they needed to figure out the meaning of the
novel word. They used the space bar to progress to the next
trial, working at their own pace.
   Participants were instructed to infer the meaning of novel
words they would encounter in the experiment. The
instructions explicitly stated that the novel words may or
may not correspond to existing words in their native
language. After the instructions, there were three blocks of
learning trials, consisting of 26 trials each, with eight
sentences each for the local reflexive and pronoun, and 10
LD reflexive sentences (including 1 mono-clausal local and           Figure 2: Mean acceptance rates, split by each anaphor
