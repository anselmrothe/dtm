tions and sets the benchmark for our child study. Experiment
2 investigates children’s truth value judgments in a guessing
game as well as their spontaneous linguistic feedback in the
same task. Considering the first question, neither children’s
truth value judgement nor their linguistic feedback support
the hypothesis that a large group of them interpret or as log-
ical conjunction. For the second question, children’s judg-
ments suggest that unlike adults, they do not derive exclu-
sivity implicatures and interpret or as inclusive disjunction.
However, children’s spontaneous linguistic feedback shows
signs of sensitivity to the exclusivity implicature of or.
