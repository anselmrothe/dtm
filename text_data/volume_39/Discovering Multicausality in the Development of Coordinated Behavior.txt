introduced by Wiener (1956) based on multivariate
autoregressive (MVAR) models: if past values of Y contain
information that help predict X above and beyond the
information contained in the past values of X alone, then Y
is said to Granger-cause X.
   Kim et al. (2011) proposed a point process framework to
enable G-causality to be applied to point process data with a
discrete nature. A temporal point process is a stochastic time
series of binary events that occurs in continuous time. It can
only take on two values at any point in time, indicating
whether or not an event has occurred. With a time series
dataset of an ensemble of variables, the occurring likelihood
of the event variable X can be modeled by the generalized
linear model (GLM): a linear combination of time series X’s
dependency to the history of each individual element in the
ensemble. Given a set of multivariate temporal streams, the
causal relationships from variable Y to X is assessed by
calculating the relative reduction in the likelihood of
producing this particular history of time series of X when
the history of Y is excluded, compared with the likelihood if
all the available covariates are used in the prediction
calculation. If the prediction likelihood is reduced when the
history of variable Y is excluded from calculation, then there
exists a Granger causal relationship from Y to X. In               Figure 1: (a) A dual eye-tracking child-parent interaction

 Figure 4: (a) The development coordination vector for each dyad’s G-cause network. Red cells indicate the emergence of
 significantly positive G-cause links from 9 months to 12 months between different pairs of behavior variables. Each row
 represents the developmental change in coordination network for one dyad. Each column represents the developmental
 change for a particular type of causal relation link. Three causal relation links, child hand→child eye, parent hand→child
 hand and child hand→parent hand, are omitted here because we did not observe the emergence of significantly positive
 links. (b) The hypothesized frequency distribution of emergent causal links if increased coordination was achieved by only
