The Present Studies
Here, we explore adults’ and children’s sensitivity to linguis-
tic subjectivity across four experiments. In particular, we ask
whether, in addition to considering the real-world distribution
of a specific noun’s referents along a given dimension, listen-
ers also interpret adjectives like “tall” relative to what they
know of the distribution that the speaker has experienced. To
test these ideas, we manipulate whether two speakers expe-
rience different distributions of exemplars of a novel object
kind (Exps. 1 and 3), or identical distributions of exemplars              Figure 1: Schematic of experimental setup for Exps. 1–4.
