   We conducted a separate analysis for objective and
subjective measures of CP for two reasons. The first is that
some researchers have suggested based on neural evidence
that learned CP is not a genuinely perceptual effect but
occurs at a higher, post-perceptual level (e.g., Clifford,
Franklin, Holmes, Drivonikou, Özgen, & Davies, 2012; but
see Zhong, Li, Li, Xu, & Mo, 2015 for counterevidence).
We reasoned that if this were the case, studies employing
more subjective measures of learned CP, such as ratings of
similarity or typicality, should show stronger effects. The
second is that there is a worry that learned CP effects could
be the result of demand effects (Goldstone, Lippa, &
Shiffrin, 2001). That is, participants in these experiments
may indicate that two items are subjectively more similar
(dissimilar) to each other precisely because the experiment
trains them that the two objects belong to the same category
(different categories), and not because of any perceived
change in similarity of the visual objects. If this is a
contributing factor, then we would expect studies with
subjective measures to have higher power, because this
demand effect will only contribute for subjective measures               Figure 3: P-curve for learned CP results based on
