Procedure
The experiment started with two practice trials. They were
followed by fourteen experimental trials presented in a
random order. Each standard learning stimulus was
introduced with a novel count noun (Landau, Smith &
Jones, 1988) (e.g. “this is a buxi” and “this is a buxi TOO”
for the other standard). A puppet named Yoshi was used in
order to make the task more attractive for children and to
make the use of non-words to refer to known objects more
meaningful with the following instructions: “In this game
we are going to learn the language of Yoshi. Yoshi is living
far away from here”. The objects were presented
sequentially and were left in view during the entire trial. The
two learning stimuli were presented in a row and their
location was determined randomly. The forced-choice test
phase was identical in all conditions. The two test objects        Figure 2: Percentage of Taxonomic choices as a function of
