Abstract

locations, objects, actions and themes and invests them into
the plot’s trajectory (Graesser, Singer & Trabasso, 1994).
These details (microstructure) are the access points to a
larger interactive narrative (macrostructure) that situates the
concepts (van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983). Thus, designers must
create assets that engage players in problem spaces through
the processes that foster correct mental model constructions
(Johnson-Laird, 1980). Black and Bower (1980) found that
the structure of stories, with actors, settings, problems and
solutions, aided in participants inference making and recall.
In effect, the coherence of narrative schemas helps
participants chunk details into mental models (Black, Turner
& Bower, 1979) and ideally, the audiences’ investment in
the narrative can motivate player’s explorations of the
processes for creating and comparing fractions in a problem
space conducive for discovery (Brown, Collins & Duguid,
1989).

Digital-tablets distribute cognition through visual, auditory
and haptic interactivity. We designed a tutor-game that
explored how narratives ((S)trong/(W)eak) and gestures
((I)conic/(D)eictic) could be combined to situate embodied
learning. Students played seven levels of a fractions game
designed to teach them how to create and compare fractions.
One hundred thirty-one students (N=131, age x̄ =8.78 yrs,
52.6% Female) were randomly assigned to one of four groups
(SI, SD, WI, WD) in a 2x2 factorial experiment. Students
completed pre/post direct and transfer assessments and tutorgame log data was mined to explore characteristics of
students learning. Results revealed a significant interaction
between narrative and gesture moderated by student
proficiency. In effect, students new to fractions performed
better in an abstract environment using deictic (pointing)
gestures. However, as students' proficiencies improved, they
learned better using iconically enactive gestures in strong
narrative with setting, characters and a plot. This has
important implications for designing adaptive learning
platforms and curricula for teaching fractions.

Introduction
Tutor-games provide learners with dynamic experiences that
channel their visual (sight), aural (sound) and haptic (touch)
perceptions into their cognitions (Baddeley, 1986; Ricker,
AuBuschon & Cowan, 2010). As virtual portals, digital
tablets allow educators to situate learning in various
contexts that scaffold the processes that connect concepts
(Barab et al., 2007; Brown, Collins & Duguid, 1989; Saxe,
1988; Lave, 1988; Schwartz & Bransford, 1999). The
touch-based gestural interface of digital tablets accesses the
haptic channel as a means for embodying concepts (Varela,
Thompson, & Rosch, 1990; Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg &
Kaschak, 2002; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). The multi-modal
ecology of digital tablets allows researchers to scaffold
experiences that afford (Gibson, 1979) students freedom to
explore with feedback that guides their learning (Dewey,
1938/1963).

Theoretical Background
Developing Narrative. Developing an effective narrative
invests the audience in the continuity of the characters,

Developing Gestural Mechanics. Goldin-Meadow, Cook
and Mitchell (2009) demonstrated that a pairing gesture
(i.e., two fingers to identify two numbers as a pairing)
facilitated elementary students strategies for arithmetic
problems and demonstrates how gestures as abstractions are
still rooted in relation to the body. In the cognitive science
literature, gestures have been typically defined as
spontaneous co-articulations with speech (Kendon, 1972;
McNeill, 1992), but in the digital age, the physicality of
gestures has been co-opted into gestural mechanics as an
interface with touch and motion based digital technologies.
Educators can leverage the mechanics of gestures as
communications of concepts and strategies by simulating
perceptual states to activate learners’ understandings
(Goldin-Meadow, 1999).
Exploratory studies (Swart et al., 2014) revealed types of
gestures learners used when explaining fractions. Echoing
Hostetter’s and Alibali’s (2008) Gestures as Simulated
Action,
students
majoritively used either
iconic
gestures
(I)
(metaphorical, enactive,
symbolic) that enact their
understandings or deictic
(D) gestures (pointing)
that identify them (Fig. 1).

The Tutor-Game: Mobile Movement Mathematics (M3).
The human ability to think mathematically manifests
from the endowments of our perceptual systems. It includes
our abilities to estimate the magnitudes of spaces and
durations of time as well as enumerate objects by
differentiating the intensities of stimuli in our surroundings
(Dehaene, 1997). These experiences ground the embodied
metaphors of mathematical thinking (Lakoff & Núñez,
2001; see Fig 2) and we recognize that fractions originate in
the processes of fracturing wholes into parts. Thus, we
chose to use object fracturing as the metaphor for
developing
a
situatively
embodied
curriculum.

Fig. 2: Embodied Experiences of Mathematical Fractions

The tutor-game consisted of 7 levels of 5 fractions that
were situated in either a strong (S) or weak (W) narrative.
The strong narrative had a setting, characters and plot based
on the PBS series Cyberchase, and was compared to a weak,
non-descript environment without narrative elements (see
Fig. 3). We characterized it as “weak” in lieu of “no”
narrative to account for researchers inability to control for
any internal narratives that students might devise.

The Experiment
In order to isolate for the impact of gesture (I vs. D) and
narrative (S vs. W) on learning, we devised, designed and
developed 4 versions of the digital tablet tutor-game (M3)
that resulted in the following experimental conditions: SI,
SD, WI, and WD, and all other factors (curriculum, assets,
instructions, feedback, and scaffolding) were held constant.
Under the gesture hypothesis (embodied), iconic gestures
with richer perceptual affordances (Black, Segal, Vitale and
Fadjo, 2012) should help learners embody mathematical
concepts better than deictic gestures. We predicted that
iconic gestures, by grounding concepts in real-world
actions, connect internal processes of our cognition and
affect better than deictic gestures.
For the narrative hypothesis (situated), contextualizing
problem spaces (via setting, characters and plot) helps
learners engage in the construction of their own conceptual
models. By situating learning, we predicted that the strong
(S) narrative will produce higher levels of engagement and
motivation and higher levels of learning compared to a weak
(W) narrative.
The third hypothesis arises from the interplay of design
and how independent factors will interact. The interaction
hypothesis suggests that combinations of narrative types (S
vs. W) and gesture types (I vs. D) will create learning
environments that vary in their efficiency for the learner. In
favor of the situated and embodied condition, we predicted
that the SI condition would perform better than SD and or
WI conditions, while the WD condition would perform
better than SD and or WI.
The fourth hypothesis stems from our classroom
observations of students’ play and the prospect for
differential efficiencies between SI and WD.
The
proficiency hypothesis suggests that learners' existing
proficiencies at fractions will moderate how they play and
learn. In favor of the situated and embodied condition, we
predicted that students with lower proficiencies would
benefit more from the situated embodied experience of the
SI condition while students with higher proficiencies would
benefit from the abstractions of the WI condition.

Methods

Fig. 3. Strong Narrative (L) & Weak Narrative (R)

To play, students used either iconic or deictic gestures in a
2-part tutor-game: [Part 1] Players estimated, denominated,
numerated and re-estimated using the fractivator (a hybrid
of a rectangular area model and a number line (Siegler &
Opfer, 2003); [Part 2] Players determined equivalency
between fractions by ordering them, magnifying their height
and delineating each onto a vertical number line (Fig. 4).

Participants. One hundred thirty-one participants from
grades 3 (N=131; x̄ age=8.78 years [1.36], 52.6% female) at
afterschool programs in New York City obtained parental
consent to participate in the program.
Procedure. Researchers formally tested a total of 131
students in specially designated classrooms where
researchers and monitors proctored over the sessions,
administered assessments, collected observational and video
record the sessions. In a 2x2 randomized factorial, students
were assigned to play one of four game-based environments
(Strong-Iconic (SI, nsi = 35), Strong-Deictic (SD, nsd = 27),
Weak-Iconic (WI, nwi = 34), Weak-Diectic (WD, nwd =
35)). Each student completed 3 one-hour sessions that in
total included pre-tests, game play, post-tests and exit-

surveys (see Fig. 5). Students’ sessions were run in separate
groups of 10 (5/condition) with a total of 2 sessions per day
(total of 20 students/day; 5 per condition) for 3 days each
week, extended over multiple weeks and some students
participated in an optional 4th-day clinical interview.

p < .107 and significantly higher than WI, t(67) = 2.069, p <

Preliminarily, this suggests that the strong narrative
combined with iconic gestures as well as the deictic gestures
combined with weak narrative both provide a learning
experience significantly more efficient than either the
strong-deictic or weak-iconic pairings.

the situated embodied approach (SI) was better for low

embodied) or those with higher proficiencies. The second
path model determines if students’ initial proficiencies
(MOi, pre-test score) moderated how students played (MEi,
telemetry data) and improved on formal assessments (Yi).

Mediation with a Covariate Models. The next series of
analyses looked principally at how condition and tutor-game
play account for the variance in students’ post-test scores
while controlling for pre-test scores. Fig. 8 depicts the
conceptual path model used for the stepwise construction of
the Hierarchical Linear Regressions (HLR) predicting the
variance in the assessment scores.
The path model depicts how the variance in dependent
variable (Y, post-test assessment score) is accounted for by
the independent variable (X, condition – SI, SD, WI, WD),
while controlling for a covariate (COV, pre-test assessment
score) and mediated by students’ tutor-game play (ME,
telemetry data).
Direct Assessment Total Post-Test. The first HLR
regresses condition, pre-test scores and tutor-game play on
direct assessment total scores. The complete meditational
covariate model significantly predicted the outcome of
students Direct Assessment Post-Test scores R = .645, F(7,
4577) = 543.80, p < .001. With the covariance of pre-test
controlled, tutor-game play predicted a significant amount
of the variance in Direct Post-Test Assessment scores (B =
.623, SEB = 0.012, β = .607, p < .001, 95% CI [.599, .646]).
Transfer Assessment: Total Score. The complete model
significantly predicted the outcome of students Transfer

tutor-game play predicted a significant amount of the
variance in direct post-test assessment scores R = .626,
F(3,4580) = 35.47, p < .001..

both the SI and WD conditions were efficient environments
for learning, it was important to clarify the nature of the

Visual inspection suggests that the WD group shows better

The moderated meditational model of the proficiency
hypothesis confirmed that student performances in the game
on formal assessments were significantly moderated by their
existing proficiencies with fractions. Fig. 11 (top) shows
the moderated mediation of direct assessment scores by

most if they were in the WD condition (β < 0) condition
compared to the SI (β > 0), but as proficiency improved,
students began to benefit more in the SI condition (90th

for low to high proficiencies from WD to SI for the transfer

them for future learning (Schwartz & Bransford, 1998) of
near transfer representations and new domains for fraction.
The Efficiency Principle.
Although our initial
hypotheses predicted the superlative performances by the SI
conditions for both assessments, the significant interaction
between gesture and narrative suggests that both the SI and
WD conditions are both efficient platforms for learning.
Schwartz, Bransford and Sears (2005) note that efficiency
often means rapid retrieval with accurate appropriation and
application of knowledge and skills for understanding,
solving and explaining a problem. Though the situated
embodied SI environment provided a perceptually rich
experience (Black et al., 2012) that promoted better transfer,
students using deictic gestures in the weak narrative (i.e.,
without seductive details, Harp & Mayer, 1998; Adams et
al., 2012) also showed significantly better learning. Might
the minimal and abstracted environment of the WD
condition make procedures and concepts easily salient?
The Proficiency Principle. Students with low initial
proficiencies benefitted more from playing in the WD
version of the game, while students with higher initial
proficiencies benefitted more in the SI environment. This
finding was contrary to our hypothesis and the principle of
concreteness fading (i.e., start concrete and fade to abstract;
Fyfe, McNeil, Son & Goldstone, 2014). Still to be
determined is how these results fit with The Expertise
Reversal Effect (i.e., experts require reduced guidance;
Sweller, Ayres, Kalyuga, & Chandler, 2003). Does the
presence of the strong narrative make instruction and
guidance invasive (i.e., reduced)? Nonetheless, the current
results support findings from a study by Kaminski, Sloutsky
and Heckler (2006; 2008) that found that students learned
division with remainders better using abstract symbols
rather than concrete real world depictions.

Fig. 11a & 11b. Moderated Mediation of formative assessment scores by
the interaction between condition and existing fractions proficiency.
Scores on the pre-test are stratified by percentiles along the x-axis (10th,
25th , 50th, 75th, 90th %), and values on the y-axis are the weights of the B
coefficients for changes in Direct Assessment Post-Test scores. Coefficient
values below the zero line on the y-axis indicate that the WD improved
more on post-test at that percentile and coefficient values above the zero
line indicate that students in the SI group improved more.

Significance

Discussion
The Gesture, Narrative & Interactions Hypotheses. The
significant interaction between gesture and narrative on the
direct assessment of the M3 curriculum shows that types of
gestures may be conceptualized differently depending on the
contexts in which they are embedded. It calls into question
our original theoretical assumptions that situating cognition
through narrative and embodying procedural learning
through iconic gestures would produce better learning.
The HLRs on students direct and transfer
assessment total scores showed that students tutor-game
play, including their accuracy denominating, numerating
and estimating significantly predicted learning, supporting
the position that the act of splitting objects is central to
learning fractions (Steffe, 2004; Norton & Wilkins, 2009).
Improvement on transfer assessment seems to suggest that
the procedural and conceptual knowledge that players are
developing is robust enough that the curriculum prepared

The current research demonstrated that combinations of
different narratives and gestures produced differential
learning. Ribbons and Malliet (2010) advocate for
simulational realism in gaming. They argue that there must
be balance between the rules that govern gaming
experiences (e.g., gestures) and their relevance to the
situated environment (e.g., the interactive narrative). This
research suggests that when educators are designing
pedagogy and curricula for mathematical fractions, students
should begin working with abstractions and as their
proficiency improves the learning platform should adapt to
concrete experiences.
