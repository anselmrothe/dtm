A Theory of Resonance: Towards an Ecological Cognitive Architecture

University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, United States
Abstract: This paper may be seen as a blueprint for an ecological cognitive architecture. Ecological psychology, I contend,
must be complemented with a story about the role of the CNS in perception, action, and cognition. Such a story must be a
theory of resonance compatible with the main tenets of ecological psychology. I offer here the two main elements of such a
theory: a framework (Andersonâ€™s neural reuse) and a methodology (multi-scale fractal DST).
