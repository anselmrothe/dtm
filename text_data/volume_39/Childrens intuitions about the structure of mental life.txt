Abstract
We investigated children’s understanding of mental life by
analyzing attributions of perceptual, cognitive, affective, and
other capacities. 200 children (7-9y) and 200 adults evaluated
the mental capacities of beetles or robots. By assessing which
capacities traveled together when participants disagreed about
these controversial “edge cases,” we reconstructed the latent
structure underlying mental capacity judgments from the
bottom up—a novel approach to elucidating conceptual
structure among children. For both children and adults, factor
analyses revealed a distinction between social-emotional,
physiological, and perceptual-cognitive capacities, hinting at
three fundamental ways of explaining and predicting others’
actions: as social partners, biological creatures, and goaldirected agents (each involving related forms of both
“experience” and “agency”; Gray et al., 2007). Relative to
adults, children attributed greater social-emotional capacities
to beetles and robots, suggesting that intuitive ontologies of
mental life could be critical for making sense of children’s
developing understanding of the social world.

Introduction
Questions about the nature of mental life extend back to
antiquity, but it is only recently that cognitive scientists
have begun to explore lay people’s conceptions of the mind.
One particularly exciting approach was pioneered by
Gray, Gray, and Wegner (2007) in their work on mind
perception. From participants’ responses to simple questions
about the mental capacities of various characters (e.g.,
“Which is more capable of experiencing joy: a frog or an
infant?”), Gray et al. extracted a conceptual space
characterized by two dimensions: “experience,” the extent
to which a character is capable of hunger, fear, pride, and
other inner experiences; and “agency,” the extent to which a
character is capable of self-control, morality, memory, and
other capacities central to acting in the world.
This bottom-up approach has tremendous potential in
elucidating the kinds of deep conceptual structures that are
difficult for participants to report on directly (and for
experimenters to anticipate a priori). Rather than imposing
theory-driven categories onto participants’ responses, Gray
et al. (2007) let the data speak for themselves.
However, Gray et al.’s (2007) study focused participants’
attention on the similarities and differences between
characters, thus illuminating the dimensions along which
social beings are thought to differ from each other—an
important part of social reasoning, but not equivalent to
intuitions about the structure of mental life itself.

Inspired by their approach, we recently conducted a series
of studies designed to assess intuitive ontologies of mental
life directly (Weisman, Dweck, & Markman, 2016). We
focused participants’ attention on the connections and
divisions between different aspects of mental life by asking
them to evaluate a wide variety of mental capacities for a
single character (e.g., a robot or a beetle). By analyzing
patterns of attributions across participants, we uncovered a
3-part conceptual structure that emerged reliably across
several studies: Physiological sensations and self-initiated
behaviors hung together to form a suite of capacities related
to the body; social-emotional experiences and moral agency
formed a suite of capacities related to the “soul”; and
perceptual-cognitive abilities and goal pursuit formed a suite
of capacities related to the mind. Interestingly, each of these
three factors encompassed aspects of both “experience” and
“agency.” Instead of the broad distinction that seems to
characterize adults’ understanding of social beings (Gray et
al., 2007), adults’ understanding of the structure of mental
life itself seems to hinge on distinctions among varieties of
experience and agency, and connections among related
kinds of experience and agency.
Intuitions about mental life are at the core of many of the
oldest and richest lines of research in developmental
psychology, including animism (Piaget, 1929), lay biology
and psychology (Carey, 1985), and theory of mind
(Wellman & Woolley, 1990). But most of this work has
relied on a priori distinctions between perception, desires,
emotions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge, etc. (Flavell,
1999), leaving the actual conceptual structure underlying
children’s reasoning and behavior unknown; to our
knowledge, there have been no attempts to map out the
ontology of mental life from the ground up with children.
This may be due in part to the challenges of implementing
bottom-up approaches, which generally require hundreds of
participants to answer dozens of questions—not the typical
design for studies with young children. On the other hand,
studies like Gray et al. (2007) and Weisman et al. (2016) are
built on the premise that these complex conceptual
structures can be uncovered from participants’ answers to
relatively simple questions, suggesting that this approach
might lend itself to adaptation for younger participants.
Thus, in the current study we developed a bottom-up
approach for uncovering children’s intuitions about the
structure of mental life. We believe these intuitions are
critical for making sense of children’s social and moral
reasoning about the people, animals, and other social
partners in their lives.

Study
We based our experimental paradigm on our previous
work with adults, in which participants evaluated a target
character on 40 mental capacities using a 7-point scale from
not at all capable to highly capable. Pilot testing suggested
two necessary modifications for children: rewording some
of the mental capacity items, and using a 3-point response
scale (no, kinda, yes). Although a 3-point scale is not
optimal for factor analyses, it allowed children to move fast
enough through the study to answer all 40 questions, and
maintaining this within-subjects design was our top priority
for the planned factor analysis.
As in our previous work, we focused on judgments of the
mental capacities of two “edge cases” in social reasoning: a
beetle and a robot. Because beetles are animals and robots
are artifacts, this pair provides insight into the role of
biological life in attributions of mental life—an issue of
particular interest from a developmental perspective, given
the long history of work on the development of the animate–
inanimate distinction and its relation to folk psychology.
Most critically for our bottom-up approach to uncovering
intuitive ontological structures, the “mental lives” of these
entities are controversial: People differ in their assessments
of the mental capacities of beetles and robots (Weisman et
al., 2016). This allowed us to address the following
question: When children disagree about the mental
capacities of some entity, which capacities “go together”?
Pilot testing suggested that children as young as 7y found
the paradigm easy and enjoyable, and work on the
development of lay biology and psychology has suggested
that these concepts may continue to develop well into
middle childhood (e.g., Carey, 1985; Hatano & Inagaki,
1997; Piaget, 1929; cf. S. Gelman & Opfer, 2002). Thus, we
targeted 7- to 9-y-old children for our child sample.
We also recruited a group of adults to validate our childfriendly paradigm, i.e., to evaluate whether it replicated our
earlier work with adults (Weisman et al., 2016).

Methods
Participants. 400 people participated in this study.
Children (n=200) participated at one of several Bay Area
museums or at their younger sibling’s preschool (median
study duration: 5.18min). Children ranged in age from 7.010.0y (median: 8.3y). An additional 12 children participated
but were excluded for being outside the target age range
(n=7), being of unknown age (n=4), or being shown a target
character other than a beetle or a robot (n=1).
Adults (n=200) participated via MTurk. Adult participants
had gained approval for ≥95% of previous work on MTurk;
had verified accounts based in the US; and indicated that
they were ≥18y old. Adults were paid $0.30 (median
duration: 2.48min). Repeat participation was prevented.
Materials and procedure. Participants were randomly
assigned to evaluate one of two target characters: a beetle,
accompanied by a photograph of a black beetle on a leaf

(n=98 adults, 104 children), or a robot, accompanied by a
photograph of a humanoid robot (Sony Qrio; n=102 adults,
96 children). The picture and label (a beetle or a robot)
were present throughout the survey.
Instructions focused on the idea that we wanted to know
what participants thought “[beetles/robots] can do and can
not do.” Participants rated the target character on 40 mental
capacities, presented in a random order for each participant.
On each trial, participants responded no, kinda, or yes to the
question “Do you think a [beetle/robot] can…?”
The 40 mental capacities were designed to be as close as
possible to those in our previous studies (Weisman et al.,
2016) while being comprehensible to children in early
elementary school. This set of items included physiological
sensations related to biological needs (e.g., get hungry);
emotional experiences (e.g., feel happy); perceptual abilities
(e.g., hear sounds); cognitive abilities (e.g., remember
things); capacities related to autonomy or agency (e.g.,
decide what to do); social abilities (e.g., feel guilty); and
several additional items (e.g., be aware of itself). Each of
these a priori categories included at least five items of
varying valence, complexity, and phrasing (see Table 1).
We also prepared a short definition for each item, so as to
be consistent in our responses to participants if they asked
for clarification. Children were encouraged at the beginning
of the study to ask questions if they did not know what a
word meant, in which case they given these definitions;
adults were told that they could access these definitions by
hovering over the text. Pilot testing suggested that 7 items
required clarification for most children, so these items were
always accompanied by their definitions from the beginning
of the trial (for both children and adults), as follows: have a
personality, like when someone is shy and somebody else is
silly; have beliefs, like when you think something is true; feel
pleasure, like when something feels really good; have
desires, like when you really want something; have selfcontrol, like when you stop yourself from doing something
you shouldn’t do; have goals, like when you’re trying hard
to do something or make something happen; and feel sick,
like when you feel like you might throw up.
Data preparation. We scored responses of no as 0, kinda as
0.5, and yes as 1. We dropped trials with response times that
were faster than a preset criterion of 250ms (n=3 child trials,
97 adult trials) and retained participants regardless of
skipped trials (n=55 child trials, 1 adult trial). Overall, only
1% of adult trials and 1% of child trials were missing data.
Analysis plan. Our primary goal was to determine which
mental capacities go together: e.g., if a participant indicated
that a character was capable of hunger, what other capacities
did she endorse? To do this, we used exploratory factor
analyses (EFA) to reveal the covariance structure underlying
participants’ responses, collapsing across characters and
using Pearson correlations to find minimum residual
solutions. We first examined maximal (13-factor) unrotated
solutions to determine how many factors to extract, using

1334

the following preset retention criteria: Each factor must
have an eigenvalue >1.0; individually account for >5% of
the total variance; and be the “dominant” factor (the factor
with the highest factor loading) for ≥1 mental capacity item.
We focus our interpretation on varimax-rotated solutions,
extracting the number of factors that met these criteria.
(Using polychoric correlations and/or oblimin rotation
yielded similar latent structures.)

Results and Discussion
We first assess the validity of our child-friendly paradigm
relative to our previous work with adults by examining an
EFA of adults’ responses. We then address our primary
question—children’s intuitions about the structure of mental
life—via EFA of children’s responses. Finally, we analyze
differences in factor scores between children and adults.
EFA: Adults. EFA revealed 3 factors that met our criteria.
After rotation, the first factor corresponded primarily to
physiological sensations related to biological needs. It was
the dominant factor for such items as get hungry, do math
(negative loading), feel pain, feel scared, and feel tired.
Factor 1 accounted for 25% of the variance in the rotated
maximal solution.
The second factor corresponded primarily to capacities
for self- and other-relevant emotions. It was the dominant
factor for such items as feel joy, feel proud, feel sad, feel
happy, and feel love. Factor 2 accounted for 21% of the
variance in the rotated maximal solution.
Finally, the third factor corresponded primarily to
perceptual-cognitive abilities to detect and use information
about the environment. It was the dominant factor for such
items as recognize somebody else, figure out how to do
things, remember things, sense whether something is close
by or far away, and communicate with somebody else.
Factor 3 accounted for 10% of the variance in the rotated
maximal solution. (See Table 1 for all factor loadings.)
In sum, as in our original studies (Weisman et al., 2016),
a three-factor structure emerged from adults’ mental
capacity attributions, characterized by a distinction between
physiological, social-emotional, and perceptual-cognitive
abilities. This suggests that our child-friendly paradigm was
valid: Using reworded items and a 3-point response scale
elicited the same intuitive ontology of mental life, among
adults, as revealed by our “adult-friendly” paradigm.
EFA: Children. Again, 3 factors met our retention criteria.
After rotation, the first factor corresponded primarily to
social-emotional abilities. It was the dominant factor for
such items as feel proud, feel happy, feel joy, get hurt
feelings, and feel sad. Factor 1 accounted for 25% of the
variance in the rotated maximal solution.
The second factor corresponded primarily to
physiological sensations. It was the dominant factor for such
items as get hungry, feel pain, do math (negative loading),
smell things, and feel scared. Factor 2 accounted for 18% of
the variance in the rotated maximal solution.

The third factor corresponded primarily to perceptualcognitive abilities. It was the dominant factor for such items
as be aware of itself, figure out how to do things, be aware
of things, sense whether something is close by or far away,
and sense temperatures. Factor 3 accounted for 7% of the
variance in the rotated maximal solution.
In sum, like adults, children’s mental capacity attributions
were dominated by a 3-way distinction between socialemotional, physiological, and perceptual-cognitive abilities.
Note that a number of additional or alternative latent
factors could have emerged from this analysis. For example,
children might have distinguished primarily between
internal experience and external action (Gray et al., 2007),
or they might have demonstrated finer-grained groupings of
mental capacities based on phrasing, rote knowledge, etc.
Instead, the latent conceptual structure underlying children’s
responses appears to be very similar to that of adults.
Children vs. adults. To formally compare responses from
children and adults, we considered the full, combined
dataset and examined factor scores by age group.
EFA using the combined dataset revealed three factors
that met our retention criteria. Unsurprisingly, these three
factors were very similar to those revealed for adults and
children analyzed independently: They corresponded to
social-emotional abilities, physiological sensations, and
perceptual-cognitive abilities (see Table 1).
The purpose of this combined EFA was to examine
differences in adults’ and children’s evaluations of beetles
and robots within this 3-part structure. To do so, we derived
factor scores (via the ten Berge method) using the rotated 3factor solution. This yielded 3 scores for each participant,
corresponding, in principle, to holistic judgments of the
social-emotional, physiological, and perceptual-cognitive
abilities of the target character the participant evaluated.
(Note that each of these 3 scores takes into account factor
loadings for all 40 mental capacities, as listed in Table 1.)
This allowed us to examine the effects of age group
(adult, child), character (beetle, robot), and factor (socialemotional, physiological, perceptual-cognitive) on these
scores via mixed effects linear regression. See Table 2 for
the results of a maximal model and Fig. 1 for mean scores.
Collapsing across age groups and domains (physiological,
social-emotional, and perceptual-cognitive), factor scores
suggest that participants generally attributed fewer mental
capacities to the robot than the beetle (b=-0.25). However,
this appears to be entirely due to the huge discrepancy
between characters in the physiological domain; the
difference between characters was reduced to nothing in the
social-emotional domain (b=0.26), and reversed in the
perceptual-cognitive domain (b=0.39). Collapsing across
entities (beetle, robot), children tended to attribute more
mental capacities adults (b=0.19), but this was driven
primarily by the social-emotional domain (b=0.46), and was
reversed in the perceptual-cognitive domain (b=-0.30).
Scores in the physiological and perceptual-cognitive
domains were very similar for children and adults: Both

children and adults marked a clear difference between the
robot and the beetle in the physiological domain (Fig. 1,
center), in line with the animate–inanimate distinction1; and
both age groups credited the robot with slightly greater
perceptual-cognitive skills than the beetle (right). In
contrast, in the social-emotional domain (left) both the
beetle and the robot received rather low scores among
adults, but very high scores among children. See Fig. 2 for
raw counts of no, kinda, and yes responses for all items,
grouped by character, age group, and dominant factor.
In sum, we see only minor differences between children
and adults in their attributions of physiological and
perceptual-cognitive abilities to beetles and robots—but a
major difference in the social-emotional domain: Relative to
adults, children tended to credit both beetles and robots with
much greater social-emotional abilities.

General Discussion
A bottom-up approach designed to shed light on children’s
intuitions about the ontology of mental life revealed an
adult-like conceptual structure in place among 7- to 9-y-old
children. Patterns of mental capacity attributions revealed a
shared fundamental distinction between social-emotional,
physiological, and perceptual-cognitive abilities. To our
knowledge, this is the first bottom-up exploration of
children’s intuitions about the structure of mental life.
In a close parallel to adults (Weisman et al., 2016), the
distinction that loomed the largest in children’s responses
1

Compared to adults, children credited robots with slightly
greater physiological capabilities. This is particularly obvious in
examining modal responses for items like feel safe (adults: no,
n=82; children: yes, n=40), feel tired (adults: no, n=88; children:
no, n=38, yes, n=36), and feel scared (both age groups: no, n=93
adults, 50 children), which each have emotional and cognitive
connotations in addition to their relevance for biological life.

each of the three factors (social-emotional, physiological,

was not between experience and agency (Gray et al., 2007),
but between three varieties of experience: emotional,
physiological, and perceptual. Echoing this previous work,
different aspects of agency were distributed across these
factors: The social-emotional factor included several items
related to moral agency (e.g., understand how somebody
else is feeling, know what’s nice and what’s mean), while
items related to goal pursuit tended to pattern with
perceptual-cognitive abilities (decide what to do, make
plans).2 For both children and adults, connections between
related varieties of experience and agency seemed to play a
particularly important role in intuitive ontologies of mental
life—perhaps because they allow us to explain and predict
others’ actions in several fundamental domains (interactions
among social partners, the bodily needs of animals, and the
goal-directed actions of agents).
Although the conceptual structure underlying children’s
mental capacity attributions was quite similar to that of
adults’, there was one striking difference in their evaluation
of entities within that structure: Children were far more
generous in their assessment of the social-emotional abilities
of both beetles and robots. The specificity of this age
difference—which emerged dramatically in one domain, but
not others—suggests that this is unlikely to be due either to
a general tendency toward “mentalizing” these characters
(or a simple “yes” bias). But its extension to both beetles
and robots raises many questions. With regard to robots,
children growing up in the 21st century might be converging
on a new understanding of technological “beings” as
inanimate objects with some degree of social-emotional life
(see Kahn, Gary, & Shen, 2013)—but this kind of historical
conceptual change would not predict the high rates of
social-emotional attributions to beetles that we observed.
Our findings are perhaps more consistent with a general
openness to untraditional social partners that extends into
middle childhood (but not adulthood)—or with a difference
in construals of what it means to feel proud, happy, guilty,

Note, however, that have goals loaded more strongly on the
social-emotional factor, and two potentially “moral” items (have
self-control; communicate with somebody else), loaded equally on
the social-emotional and perceptual-cognitive factors.

etc. To what kinds of entities would children of this age
deny social-emotional abilities, and how do they draw this
line? What aspects of attributing pride, happiness, or guilt
might change between 7-9y and adulthood?
Our findings point to the importance of distinguishing
between different aspects of mental life in building theories
of how social cognitive reasoning might evolve—both over
the lifespan and across history and cultures. The current
studies offer the major advantage of making these
distinctions on the basis of children’s own conceptual
structure, rather than a priori categories generated by
experimenters—an approach that could prove particularly
powerful in making sense of children’s beliefs about and
behaviors toward the many kinds of human, animal, and
technological “beings” in the modern social world.
