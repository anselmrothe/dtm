Figure 1. The predictive coding account assumes that the brain generates predictions using a cascading hierarchy of generative models,
processing only that part of the inputs that was unpredicted. Under normal circumstances one might predict to observe animals or plants,
and interpret the inputs in a likewise manner (left panel). We suggest that after administration of psychedelics these predictions become
more decomposed, leading to more fine-grained, very specific predictions, each of which has a fairly low probability. This will in general
lead to a higher prediction error and unstable predictions (right panel). Figure adapted from Clark (2016).
