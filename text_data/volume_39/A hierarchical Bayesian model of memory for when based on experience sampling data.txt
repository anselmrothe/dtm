  Like the distance model, the parameters were estimated in
a hierarchical fashion, with the natural logarithm of the

distributions normal.
Mixture model
To estimate the probability of a participant's response we
assumed a mixture model of the distance and location
(sensor) models described previously as well as a random
(uniform) guessing model and a location (week) model that
assumed that participants correctly inferred the day of the
week on which the event occurred, but had a certain
probability of incorrectly determining the week (the kind of
model that one might assume if people are relying on their
schedules to make judgements).
