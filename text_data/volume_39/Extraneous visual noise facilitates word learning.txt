resulting in a final dataset of 115,762 referent selection and
61,247 test gaze samples. Individual gaze samples were
numerically coded (1 = target look, 0 = non-target look),
creating a raw looking time measure, which was further
collapsed into 100ms time bins for statistical tractability. All
subsequent analyses use this target looking measure, and are
standardized from the offset of the first label plus 233ms
(Swingley, Pinto, & Fernald, 1999) to 6733ms post-
labeling.

At test, each novel object served as a target on one memory
reactivation trial and one retention trial. Fig. 3 depicts
looking times during the memory reactivation trials and
shows little difference in target looking in the two
conditions. This conclusion was supported by a linear mixed
effects model with main effects of time bin (treated as
continuous) and condition and their interaction, with by-
participant random slopes and intercepts for condition and
by-item random intercepts to rule out item effects (Barr,
