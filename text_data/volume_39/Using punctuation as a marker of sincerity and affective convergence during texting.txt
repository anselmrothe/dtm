be perceived as positive or negative by our participants, the
pseudo-confederate responses were presented to four female
participants (mean age = 20.5) who did not participate in the
pseudo-texting conversation. These participants were asked
to rate each pseudo-confederate response bubble on a
continuous rating scale for positive/negative valence. The
rating scale spanned 400 - 1200 pixels, with lower numbers
representing more positive valence, and higher numbers
representing       negative      valence.      The       positive
pseudo-confederate messages received an average pixel
rating of 642.11px, while the negative pseudo-confederate
