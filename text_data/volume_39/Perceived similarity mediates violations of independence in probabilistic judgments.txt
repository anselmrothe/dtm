Results
We first wanted to examine whether we had conjunction falla-
cies and violations of independence in this data set. For each
pair of likelihood judgments, e.g. {A, A ∩ B} or {A, A|B} we
can perform a paired samples t-test to assess the presence of
these effects, however this procedure would generate a sub-
stantial volume of test statistics without giving much insight.
Instead we will plot the relevant likelihoods, and quote some
representative statistics. In this contribution, we only re-
port Bayesian statistical tests that were performed using JASP
(JASP team, 2016). In particular we report Bayes factors for
the alternative versus the null hypothesis, so that values > 1
indicate evidence for the alternative hypothesis.
   We begin by assessing the conjunctions. For each pair
{A, A ∩ B} we plotted the average values across participants
of the single event and the conjunction. It is useful to split
these pairs up into four different types, depending on whether
each of the events has high or low individual probability. The
results are shown in Fig 1, and we have separated out data
that comes from responses using whole numbers and from the
Likert scale. Points that lie above the diagonal correspond to
conjunction fallacies. The first thing to note is that there are
three obvious clusterings of data points. We see straight away
that pairs of the form {A, A ∩ B̄} behave as expected, there
are no conjunction fallacies. Equally the pairs {A, A ∩ B} do
not display robust conjunction fallacies (All Bayes factors for
t-tests < 1), although these data points are slightly odd in an-
other way, which we will return to shortly. The pairs which
do display conjunction fallacies are {Ā, Ā∩B} and {Ā, Ā∩ B̄}.
