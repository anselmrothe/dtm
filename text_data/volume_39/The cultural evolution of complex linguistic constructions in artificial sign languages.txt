                            Methods
Participants took part in an artificial sign language learning
task where they learnt gestures produced by a previous partic-
ipant in a training stage, before communicating with a partner
during testing, using only gesture.
Participants
50 participants (15 male, 35 female, median age = 22) were
recruited from the University of Edinburgh’s Careers Hub
