Pilot Study
   We conducted a pilot study with 30 participants recruited
from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to identify graph
features people attend to when making judgments about the
likelihood that a particular node belonged to a defined
category. We planned to use the results of the pilot study to
inform our decision about graph features to manipulate in
