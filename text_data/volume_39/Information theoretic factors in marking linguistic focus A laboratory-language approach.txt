Procedure
In each trial a pair of participants played a simple coopera-
tive signaling game. Each sat in a separate cubicle with a
computer; neither participant could see or hear the other. The
game consisted of a series of turns in each of which one player
was nominated as Sender and the other as Receiver; players
alternated roles, with the Sender in the first turn being se-
lected at random. At the start of a turn the Receiver saw a
white screen with the message “You are waiting on a mes-
sage transmission from the other player”. The Sender saw a
screen as in Figure 1. On the left were two 7×7 grids, over                                  Figure 1: Sender’s screen.
each of which a different line figure was drawn. Every line
figure consisted of a continuous line drawn between the cen-
ter points of eleven contiguous grid cells. One of the two line
figures was selected in green, while the other was white.1
   On the right of the screen was an empty 7×7 grid, slightly
larger than the other two. Beneath the two leftmost grids there
was also a button marked Send. The Sender’s task was to
communicate to the Receiver which of the two grids was se-
lected in green by clicking on cells in the rightmost grid. At
the moment of the Sender’s first click a timer would start.
Once the timer stopped (after either 5 or 30 seconds, depend-
ing on condition; see Section Experimental conditions) the
grids would disappear and be replaced by the message “You
are waiting on a guess from the other player.” Clicking the
Send button would have the same result. Once the Sender’s
turn had come to an end in one of those two ways, the Re-
ceiver’s screen would change to display the two line figures
that had been displayed to the Sender (in a random order, but
each in the same orientation as for the Sender) as well as a
third 7×7 grid in which certain cells might be colored black,
and a button marked OK (Figure 2). The black cells would                                    Figure 2: Receiver’s screen.
