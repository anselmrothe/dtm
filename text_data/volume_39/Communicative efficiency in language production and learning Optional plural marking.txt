they should be more likely to produce plural marking, com-
pared to when referring to multiples of collective items (e.g.,
small insects).
   Preliminary support for the conceptual markedness ac-
count comes from repeated observations across a number of
studies on typologically-diverse languages which possess a
singulative/collective morphology (e.g., Arensen (1998) on
Murle, Mifsud (1996) on Maltese, Stolz (2001) on Welsh, see
(Grimm, 2012) for discussion). In these languages, referents
that are likely to be conceptualized and manipulated as col-
lectives (e.g., fruits, grains, vegetables) or as a group/mass of
individuals tend to be expressed with lexical items that have
a plural meaning by default (e.g., psy “peas” in Welsh) and
only through an additional singulative suffix can singletons
be designated (e.g., psy-en “pea”).
   A difficulty arises, however, in determining “markedness”
of plural meaning based on token counts of plural forms in
                                                                      Figure 1: Sample images of visual stimuli in Experiments 1
