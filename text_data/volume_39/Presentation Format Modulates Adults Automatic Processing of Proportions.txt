Abstract
Whereas much is known about how humans categorize and
reason based on absolute quantities, research investigating the
processing of relative quantities, such as proportions, is
comparatively limited. The current study used a Stroop-like
paradigm to examine adults’ automatic processing of
nonsymbolic proportions and how presentation formats
modulate this processing. Participants were asked to compare
individual components across proportions in six different
presentation formats. Congruity between component size and
overall proportion affected accuracy of comparison, such that
participants were less accurate when proportion (the irrelevant
dimension) was incongruent with absolute quantity (the
relevant) dimension. Moreover, the congruity effect was
modulated by the presentation format. These findings serve as
evidence that humans automatically access relative quantity
when presented in nonsymbolic formats and provide evidence
that the strength of this processing is modulated by the format
of presentation.

Introduction
Humans share with many species a non-verbal system to
estimate absolute quantity (Dehaene, 1997). The invention
of number symbols allows humans to precisely represent
absolute quantity instead of mere approximate estimation.
However, simple absolute quantification is often not
sufficient to guide behavior. We frequently need to relate
two quantities to generate a new construct: proportion or
ratio. Although much is known about the processing of
absolute quantity (either symbolic or nonsymbolic),
comparatively little is known about how the brain encodes
relative quantity.
To represent relative quantity accurately, humans exploit
their symbolic numerical competence by using number
fractions. However, children and adults often experience
great challenges and difficulties in learning and using
fractions (Ni & Zhou, 2005). Furthermore, research on
symbolic fractions suggest that the numerical magnitudes
represented by symbolic fractions are not automatically
activated (Kallai and Tzelgov, 2009), and that the holistic
processing of symbolic fractions depends on the stimuli and
task contexts (Meert et al., 2009; Meert et al., 2010;
Schneider & Siegler, 2010). For example, Meert and
colleagues (2009) observed that access to the magnitude of

symbolic fractions was affected by the congruity or
incongruity between the value of the single components and
the value of whole fraction. Schneider and Siegler (2010)
found that adults process fraction magnitudes holistically
when the task does not allow them to use any shortcut
strategies that would enable separate processing of the
numerator and denominator magnitudes.
Similar to absolute quantity, which can be judged
approximately without symbols, proportion (relative
quantity) can also be determined non-verbally. Studies have
suggested that even by a young age, humans can understand
proportion information when presented nonsymbolically
(McCrink & Wynn, 2007; Jacob, Vallentin, & Nieder, 2012;
Matthews, Lewis, & Hubbard, 2015). For instance, infants
can discriminate between two ratios long before the concept
of proportionality is introduced during formal schooling
(McCrink & Wynn, 2007).
Research even suggests that the magnitudes of
proportions
are
automatically
activated
(Duffy,
Huttenlocher, Levine, 2005; Duffy, Huttenlocher, Levine, &
Duffy, 2005; Fabbri et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2015;
Matthews & Lewis 2016). Six-month-olds dishabituated
when the relation between a dowel and its container
changed but not when the absolute size of both object
changed while the relation was held constant (Duffy,
Huttenlocher, Levine, & Duffy, 2005). Moreover, 4-yearolds chose the dowel which had the same dowel-container
relation as the original display rather than the one with the
same absolute dowel size (Duffy, Huttenlocher, Levine,
2005). Fabbri et al. (2012) found that the magnitude of
proportions can be automatically and holistically processed
by adults using a congruity manipulation in which the
greater numerosity of white dots co-occurred with a lower
proportion. Yang et al. (2015) found that proportion
interfered with preschool children’s area comparison
performance.
It is acknowledged that the cognitive processes involved
in proportion processing vary depending on the type of
proportional relation involved (i.e., part-to-part vs. part-towhole) (Sophian & Wood, 1997; Spinillo & Bryant, 1999;
Möhring, Newcombe, Levine, & Frick, 2016), and display
types (i.e., continuous, discretized, discrete) (Spinillo &
Bryant, 1999; Jeong, Levine, & Huttenlocher, 2007; Boyer,
Levine, & Huttenlocher, 2008).

Proportions can be presented as either part-to-part
relations or part-to-whole relations. Previous research
suggested that part-to-part presentation is easier for 6- to 8year-old children (Spinillo & Bryant, 1999). However, other
study provided evidence that children performed better for
problems involving part-to-whole presentation (Sophian &
Wood, 1997; Möhring, Newcombe, Levine, & Frick, 2016).
There is no evidence yet for if and how adults would
perform differently for these two relations presentation.
Proportions can also be displayed as continuous, discrete,
or discretized (see Figure 1). Previous studies generally
agreed that continuous display encourages perceptual
approximate measurement of the intensive quantity, while
discrete (and discretized) display would lead to exact
counting strategy (e.g., Boyer, Levine, & Huttenlocher,
2008; DeWolf, Bassok, & Holyoak, 2015). This was
underlined by findings that children showed greater and
earlier success in judging proportions displayed as
continuous quantities than in judging proportions displayed
as discrete quantities even if other variables were controlled
to be constant (Spinillo & Bryant, 1999; Jeong, Levine, &
Huttenlocher, 2007; Boyer, Levine, & Huttenlocher, 2008).
For adults, we do not know yet whether they are still
influenced by the display format.
These results suggest that presentation format might
influence proportions processing. Fabbri and Yang’s results
are actually different as for the level of automaticity. It is
probably due to the fact that they used different presentation
format. Fabbri et al. (2012) used arrays of dots and part-topart proportion judgment, while Yang et al., (2015) asked
participants to compare the areas of two sectors that were
designed in part-to-whole relation. Therefore, the present
study aims to systematically investigate how the level of
automaticity will change for different presentation formats.
The current study used a Stroop-like paradigm to examine
the processing level of proportions. In a Stroop-like task,
participants are asked to make judgments on one dimension
while there are other dimensions that may agree or conflict
with the one to be judged. Participants’ performance can
suggest the automatic activation of the irrelevant
dimensions. Higher error rate and longer reaction times will
be observed for incongruent trials than for congruent trials if
the irrelevant dimensions are accessed automatically. For
example, people tend to spend more time and make more
errors when they are asked to compare the magnitudes of
two numbers that have incongruent physical sizes than the
pairs that have congruent physical size with corresponding
magnitudes (Henik & Tzelgov, 1982).
In the present study, absolute quantity will be treated as
the relevant dimension and relative quantity (proportion) as
the irrelevant dimension. For congruent trials, the larger
proportion also has the larger components. For incongruent
trials, the larger proportion would have the smaller
components. If participants’ performance is worse in the
incongruent condition, it would provide evidence that the
representation about proportions is automatically activated.

We aim to investigate whether presentation format of
proportions would be automatically activated in different
levels and thus have different effects to the absolute
quantity comparisons. The size of interference in Strooplike tasks is proposed to be a function of degree of the
irrelevant dimension’s automaticity (MacLeod & Dunbar,
1988). Therefore, we focus on the size of interference to see
whether the automatic accessing level of proportions will
differ.

Method
Participants
33 undergraduate students from a large Midwestern
university participated for course credit (31 females; ages 18
– 22).

Stimuli
Presentation formats were designed to be all possible
combinations of display types and relation types.
Three display types were designed: continuous, discrete,
and discretized (see Figure 1). The discrete items were
arrays of white and black squares with width of 20 pixels.
The discretized items were displays composed of these
squares stacked to form line segments, except that they were
lined together with 1 pixel distance between them. The
continuous items were identical to the discretized displays
except that there was no space in between.
We examined both part-to-part and part-to-whole
relations. For all three displays, we varied the presentation
such that half of the proportions were presented in part-topart relation, and half were presented in part-to-whole
relation. The part-to-part relation was defined as the white
portion to the black portion; the part-to-whole relation was
defined as the white portion to the total portion.
Each proportion was presented in one of the six
presentation formats depicted in Figure 1 below.

experiment, all represent proportion of 1/3.
Each stimulus pair consisted of two proportions displayed
side by side. The center-to-center distance between the two
proportions was 800 pixels.

Procedure
Participants were instructed to select the stimulus which had
larger white portion. Participants were asked to press “d”

when they judged the left stimulus had larger white portion
and to press “j” when they judged the right stimulus had
larger white portion. Both speed and accuracy were
emphasized in instructions.
Each trial began with a 500 ms presentation of a fixation
cross in the center of the screen, immediately followed by
the stimulus pair. The pair stayed on the screen until
participants submitted a response or timed out at 3000 ms.
In each block, each of these 34 proportion pairs was
presented twice, either with the larger proportion to the left
or to the right, giving 68 trials in each block. The stimuli in
each block were presented in a random order. There were
six different blocks, and the presentation order of these six
blocks was counterbalanced, resulting a total of 408 trials.

Results
Accuracy and mean reaction time (RT) were computed for
each condition for each participant and used as the primary
outcome variables. Only correct RTs were used in the
analysis. We conducted separate repeated-measures
ANOVAs using accuracy and RT.
The repeated-measure ANOVA on the accuracy with
congruity and presentation format as within-subject factors
was calculated. Results revealed that the main effect of
congruity was significant, F (1, 32) = 15.827, p = 0.000,
!2" = 0.331. Participants made more mistakes in the
incongruent condition (M = 77.1%, SE = 4.6%) than in the
congruent condition (M = 92.0%, SE = 1.3%). The main
effect of presentation format, however, was not significant,

F (5, 160) = 0.184, p = 0.671, !" = 0.006. This indicated that
adults’ overall accuracy was not affected by presentation
formats. Figure 2 depicted the pattern of accuracy for
congruent and incongruent conditions for each presentation
format.

Accuracy

There were two conditions differing by congruity. In
congruent pairs, the stimulus which had the larger white
portion also had a larger proportion value of white portion
relative to either black portion or total (white plus black)
portion. In incongruent pairs, the stimulus which had larger
white portion had a smaller proportion value of white
portion relative to either black portion or total (white plus
black) portion. Table 1 showed all the stimuli used.

The two-way interaction of presentation format with
congruity was significant, F (5, 160) = 2.319, p = 0.046,

was modulated by presentation format.
We also analyzed reaction times in the same way as

Discussion
The results of current experiment showed that adults made
more mistakes making judgments in the incongruent
conditions than in congruent conditions. And the size of
congruity effect varied by different presentation formats.
But response time did not show such a clear pattern as
accuracy. Participants seemed to spend about same time
comparing congruent and incongruent trials. Overall, the
current study suggested that adults can automatically
process the magnitudes of proportions even though it was
irrelevant and disturbing to the absolute quantity
comparison task, and that the congruity effect was
modulated by the presentation format.
Even though more and more effort has been made to
explore human’s understanding of proportions, very little is
known about the specific processing level of them.
Consistent with previous findings that human have an
intuitive understanding of proportion and represent them
perceptually (e.g., Jacob, Vallentin, & Nieder, 2012;
Matthews, Lewis, & Hubbard, 2015), our study
demonstrated that proportions can be automatically
processed. The observation of the congruity effect
confirmed the findings of previous studies that showed the
same automatic processing of proportion (e.g., Fabbri et al.,
2012; Yang et al., 2015; Matthews & Lewis 2016). The

study also provided evidence to the fact that humans, at
least adults, can process proportion automatically no matter
what kind of formats the proportion is presented.
Moreover, based on previous findings that presentation
format can influence proportion processing, the present
study found that the level of automatic processing of
proportion varied for different presentation formats. The
size of congruity effect of automatic processing of
proportion was modulated by presentation format.
Proportions presented as discretized part-to-part display
seemed to show the largest difference of accuracy for
congruent trials and incongruent trials. This finding was a
little bit surprising, because previous studies suggested that
continuous display promotes greatest success for proportion
processing at least for children (Boyer, Levine, &
Huttenlocher, 2008). It is possible that adults adopt different
processing strategies or preference than children. It would
be interesting to see whether children shown different
congruity effect pattern for these presentation formats.
Another possibility is that the task in the current experiment
was an implicit and unintentional task for proportion
processing, while previous studies showing presentation
differences were all explicit and intentional tasks for
proportion processing (Sophian & Wood, 1997; Spinillo &
Bryant, 1999; Jeong, Levine, & Huttenlocher, 2007; Boyer,
Levine, & Huttenlocher, 2008). Humans might perform
differently during two task scenarios. Further studies will be
needed to address these issues.
Theorists generally have two different explanations to
account for the mechanism of automaticity phenomenon.
Some focus on the learned automatic processes and
emphasize the learning mechanism (Anderson, 1992).
Others believe there are innate automatic processes that
humans are born with (Hasher & Zacks, 1979). The current
study cannot tell whether the mechanism of the automatic
processing of proportion is natured or nurtured. 5-year-old
children have been found to show similar congruity effect
for accuracy but not response time in a sector comparison
task, which provided some hint that the automatic
processing of proportion is not acquired by learning or
instruction (Yang et al., 2015). However, more evidence
considering culture, education and intelligence, is required
to reach final conclusions about the mechanism of automatic
processing of proportion.
