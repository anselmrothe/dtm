Abstract
Recent emphases on differences between metaphors and
similes pose a quandary. The two forms clearly differ in
strength, but often seem to require similar interpretations. In
Experiment 1 we show that ratings of comprehensibility are
highly correlated across simile and metaphor sentences
differing only in the presence or absence of “like”. In
Experiment 2 we show that comprehensibility ratings for
figurative forms predict both early (first pass) and late
(second pass) fixation durations for metaphor vehicle, but
only late fixation durations for vehicles in similes. Simile
vehicles appear to initially be processed similarly to literal
comparisons, with figurative interpretation occurring later.
These observations are consistent with the different pragmatic
strengths, and similar interpretations of the two forms.

Introduction
Theories of figurative speech differ in emphasizing either
(abstract) categorization (e.g., Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990)
or analogical comparison across domains (e.g., Tourangeau
& Sternberg, 1982). Bowdle and Gentner (2005) proposed
that unfamiliar figurative usages tend to be preferred in
simile form (“Moonlight is like bleach”) whereas familiar
ones are preferred in metaphor form (“Alcohol is a crutch”).
They suggest that the surface form of a simile mirrors the
cognitive processing (analogical reasoning) needed for an
unfamiliar figurative meaning.
But it isn’t the case that mere comparison captures
analogical comparison. Aristotle is sometimes described
dismissively as a comparison theorist (e.g., Tourangeau &
Sternberg, 1982), but Israel, Harding and Tobin (2004)
rightly point out that Aristotle is a metaphor-first theorist.
Aristotle has also been characterized as considering
metaphors to be implicit analogies (Levin, 1982). Similes,
on this view, might be figurative to the extent that they
require cross-domain implicit analogical reasoning.
Glucksberg and Haught (2006) observed that adding an
off-category adjective (e.g., “Moonlight is (*like) romantic
bleach”) disrupts the preference scheme identified by
Bowdle and Gentner (2005). From this Glucksberg and
Haught seek to argue that figurative categorization is the
only plausible account of metaphor. They argue that their
adjectival noun-phrases are dis-preferred in simile form

because similes refer to literal referents. But non-existing
categories like “romantic bleach” block comparison
generally, and do not differentiate literal from figurative
comparison. Moreover, they seem to violate the need for
distinct domains required for analogy to work.
In this paper we will adopt the strategy of contrasting
online comprehension of similes both with metaphor and
with literal comparisons (as recommended by Israel et al.,
2004). By this means we will test whether similes are
simply interpreted literally, as Glucksberg and Haught
(2006) argued, or if they also differ from literal comparisons
in ways that clarify their normal designation as figurative.
In Experiment 1 we will show how similar the
comprehensibility ratings of associated metaphor and simile
forms are. Despite previously recognized differences in
strength (e.g., Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990), aptness (e.g.,
Kennedy & Chiappe, 1999), and preference (e.g., Bowdle &
Gentner, 2005), we find that comprehensibility judgments
are relatively similar across both simile and metaphor forms
for simple vehicles without adjectival modification. This
suggests similar interpretations are reached for the figurative
meaning of the vehicle in each figurative form.
In Experiment 2, we will use measures of gaze during
reading to show that initial reading of similes more closely
resembles that for literal comparisons than that for
metaphors. Metaphors show reliable effects of figurative
comprehensibility during initial first-pass reading; similes
and literal comparisons do not show such comprehensibility
effects early on. However, during second-pass reading,
fixation durations on simile and metaphor vehicle both show
strong
correlations
to
ratings
of
figurative
comprehensibility. This suggests that the figurative
interpretation of a simile vehicle may simply be computed
later than that of a metaphor.

Experiment 1: Comprehensibility Ratings
Methods
Materials (for Experiments 1 and 2) Seventy-five
metaphors were gathered or updated from previous studies
(Katz, Paivio, Marschark & Clark, 1988; Bowdle &
Gentner, 2005; Thibodeau and Durgin, 2011). For gaze
analysis (Experiment 2), each sentence was extended with a
few words intended to be largely neutral with respect to

1967

interpreting the sentence (e.g., “A smile is (like) a magnet
for people.”). A set of literal comparison statements was
developed using the same vehicles (e.g., “A black hole is
like a magnet in space.”). To balance the number of
sentences that did not include “like” and were not figurative,
we also included 25 literal categorization statements filler
sentences unrelated to the 75 experimental items. Three lists
of 100 items were constructed in which one third of the 75
items appeared in each of the three forms (metaphor, simile,
literal comparison) along with the 25 fillers.

the vehicle (e.g., during reading of the metaphor) is
substantially different in similes and metaphors. In order to
better understand how comprehension may unfold
differently for the two figurative forms, we next measured
gaze patterns during reading of these same sentences.

Participants and Task A total of 91 adults were recruited
through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to make ratings of
comprehensibility of the critical word in each sentence. A
third were assigned to each of the three lists of stimuli.

Design and Procedure The linguistic materials were
identical to those used in Experiment 1, except that 6
practice items were developed to allow participants time to
adapt to the task. One third of the 75 experimental items
appeared in each of three forms (metaphor, simile, literal
comparison) for each participant, according to one of three
lists, and were randomly ordered and intermixed with 25
(filler) literal categorization sentences. Sentences were
presented one at a time on a monitor in front of the
participant after first establishing gaze on a fixation point
just to the left of the presentation of the sentence.
Participants were to read the sentence and respond by
pressing a key when they had comprehended it. The
sentence was then removed, and an easy multiple-choice
comprehension test followed, asking which of four terms
was most relevant to the meaning of the sentence they had
just read (e.g., for “A smile is (like) a magnet for people”,
the correct answer was “attract”). Subjects made their
Literal and figurative (ns)
choice using a game-pad with an appropriate spatial
7
mapping to the choices on the screen. The entire
experimental session took about 20 minutes.

Results and Discussion
As shown in Figure 1, comprehensibility ratings of
metaphor and simile vehicles were highly correlated across
items, R73 = 0.85, p < .001. A common factor, produced by
averaging the figurative rating sets by item accounted for
92% of the variance in the simile ratings and 93% of the
variance in the metaphor ratings. There was, of course, no
correlation between this common rating measure for
figurative vehicles and the ratings given for the same words
in literal comparisons with the same vehicles, R73 = 0.01, ns.
It appears that ratings for both figurative sentence forms
are typically based on similar figurative meaning, defined in
relation
to the topic.

Experiment 2: Gaze Measures when Reading
Comparisons, Similes and Metaphors
The rating data of Experiment 1 are consistent with the
assumption of many scholars that there is good reason to
suppose that similar figurative meanings are often achieved
by sentences in simile and metaphor forms, even if they may
sometimes diverge in understanding. However the rating
data reflect post-interpretive evaluations and do not bear on
the question of whether the initial cognitive encounter with

the figurative items these ratings were averaged across
figurative conditions. For gaze variables, we first used
model comparisons to test whether the ratings had
predictive value that differed between figurative sentence
types. For example, if metaphor vehicles are treated as
figurative words, while simile vehicles are treated as literal
words, we might expect ratings of figurative interpretability
from Experiment 1 to predict only the metaphor forms, and
not the simile forms. To test for this we compared LMER
models that included an interaction term (between ratings

time was expected to be correlated with comprehensibility
ratings for all sentences.
Comprehension Time Participants’ main task was simply
to indicate comprehension of the sentence after reading it by
pressing a key. The distribution of times was skewed, so
centered log transformations of these times were used for
statistical modeling. The main LMER model included
sentence type (metaphor, simile and comparison) and
comprehensibility ratings from Experiment 1 as predictors.
Error terms included subjects and item as well as the
slopes for sentence form by subjects and by items, and the
slopes of ratings by subjects. Model comparisons showed
that including the interaction between sentence type and
rating did not explain reliably more variance than a model
without the interaction, X2(2) = 0.27, p = .875, indicating
that the relation to ratings did not differ by sentence type.
Rather for all three sentence types, ratings predicted
comprehension time, t(117.3) = 3.54, p < .001
(Satterthwaite approximations of df will be reported
throughout; see Luke, 2006). However, compared to the
similes, response times were reliably longer for the literal
comparison sentences, t(48.6) = 3.94, p < .001. Consistent
with effects previously observed for apt or conventional
figurative vehicles (e.g., Bowdle & Gentner, 2005;
Glucksberg & Haught, 2006), comprehension time was
marginally shorter for the metaphors than similes, t(35.1) =
1.93, p = .062. The observed relationship of rated
comprehensibility and comprehension time is shown in
Figure 2 separately for each sentence type. These data
reflect the expected relationships between comprehensibility
ratings and comprehension time.

between first fixating the critical word and finally reading
past the word, (4) the likelihood of refixating the word after
passing it, and (5) if refixation occurred, the total time taken
fixating the word after first passing it.
Our primary interest is in differences associated with the
presence of “like” in advance of the figurative word, since
the simile and metaphors forms used are otherwise identical.
Comparisons between the literal comparisons and similes
are also of interest, however, given that we are asking
whether the figurative vehicle words in similes are initially
processed literally.
Gaze Data Transformation and Truncation Duration data
associated with gaze patterns were also log transformed to
reduce skewing and were centered for analyses.
Transformed durations that were more than 4 standard
deviations above the transformed mean for that measure
were truncated to 4 SDs. The proportion of data affected by
this method was less than 1% each measure discussed.
Ratings were centered (by subtracting off the mean) prior to
analysis.
Gaze Behavior 1: First Fixation Duration. If participants
initially seek to understand metaphor vehicles figuratively,
but simile vehicles literally, the duration of their first
fixation on the critical word might correlate with ratings of
comprehensibility for figurative items only for metaphors.
Consistent with this hypothesis, comparison of LMER
models of the figurative sentence data, with and without
interactions terms, showed that the relationship of FFD to
ratings differed for the two figurative forms, X2(1) = 7.32, p
= .007. As expected, separate models of the two condition
indicated that FFD for the figurative vehicle was related to

1969

the rated comprehensibility in the metaphor form, t(35.6) =
4.06, p < .001, and not in the simile form, t(68.0) = 0.10, ns.
Models of FFD contrasting the two comparison sentence
forms (literal comparisons and similes), found no
differences in FFD between the two forms (X2(2) = 2.74, p =

that the relation of GPT to rated comprehensibility differed

.254. The data for each form are plotted in the top panels of
Figure 2. This pattern is consistent with the idea that the
figurative vehicle in a simile is initially treated as a literal
referent, as argued by Glucksberg and Haught (2006a). In
contrast, initial encounters with metaphor vehicles produced
effects consistent with an immediate search for a figurative
interpretation.
Gaze behavior 2: Go past time. Go past time (GPT) is
defined as the entire duration from first entering the critical
word until finally passing to the right of the critical word.
GPT for each sentence form is shown in bottom panels of
Figure 3 as a function of comprehensibility rating. Because
GPT includes FFD, FFD was included as a covariate in
LMER analyses of GPT (the analyses come to the same
conclusions without the covariate).
Again, we first sought to test whether there were reliable
relationships between GPT and rated comprehensibility for
figurative items, and, if so, whether these differed between

LMER models showed that, for metaphor sentences, GPT
was reliably related to figurative comprehensibility ratings,
t(64.4) = 2.60, p = .011. This was not the case for similes,
t(74.1) = 1.49, p = .141 (where the trend was in the opposite
direction, consistent with delays for highly conventional
metaphors presented as similes).
Models comparing GPT for the similes and literal
comparison sentences5 indicated that including the
interaction of ratings and sentence type in the models made
no reliable difference, X2(1) = 2.75, p = .097. A separate
model of literal comparisons confirmed that here was also
no reliable relationship between GPT and rated
comprehensibility, t(76.9) = 0.70, p = .486. Thus, prior to
exiting the critical word to the right in the simile form, the
figurative vehicle may still be treated primarily as a referent
to the literal comparison category as the reader passes on the
rest of the sentence.

Gaze Behavior 3: Returns to the Target Word From the
Right Participants often returned to the critical word after
they had already read beyond it. Indeed, this happened in
roughly 59% of trials (60% of metaphor trials, 58% of
literal comparison trials and 57% of simile trials). Is the
likelihood of such Regressions In (RI: if the critical word
was refixated on a given trial after exiting to the right)
related to rated comprehensibility? LMER models of RI for
the figurative sentences showed a reliable relationship
existed between rated comprehensibility and the likelihood
of RI, t(59.9) = 2.29, p = .026, and that this effect did not
reliably differ between metaphors and similes, X2(1) =
0.003, ns. But LMER models of RI for comparison
sentences also showed a reliable main effect of rated
comprehensibility, t(38.4) = 2.27, p = .029, and no evidence
of an interaction, X2(1) = 0.04, ns. Thus, RI was more likely,
for all sentence forms, as comprehensibility decreased.

= 1.71, p = .095, but also failed to detect reliably different
effects of ratings for similes and literal comparisons, X2(1) =
0.36, p = .548.
To resolve the mixed evidence regarding similes in these
two analyses, we modeled the effect of ratings on each
sentence type separately, both with and without the total
comprehension time as a covariate. For literal comparisons,
there was no evidence that P2TT was related to
comprehensibility ratings either with the covariate included,
t(64.3) = 0.56, p = .580, or without it, t(59.9) = 0.99, p =
.327. Conversely, consistent with overall analyses of
figurative sentences, in individual analyses of each of the
figurative forms P2TT was similarly, but weakly related to
comprehensibility when the covariate was included
(metaphor: t(49.3) = 1.82, p = .075; simile: t(37.5) = 1.94, p
= .060) and highly reliably related to comprehensibility
when the covariate was not included in the models
(metaphor: t(34.4) = 3.13, p = .004; simile: t(58.0) = 2.92, p
= .005). Recall that the overall relationship of
comprehensibility and P2TT for figurative items in our
combined analyses was reliable even with total response
time included as a covariate (i.e., p = .007, above). A similar
analysis without the covariate also provided strong evidence
of an overall relationship, t(52.4) = 2.99, p = .004.
Does P2TT help to explain overall response time
differences for figurative items? To test whether P2TT,
itself, can account for longer overall overt comprehension
responses, a new analysis of overall response time was
conducted (for trials displaying RI) with and without P2TT
as a covariate. Without P2TT included, there was strong
evidence of a relationship between ratings of
comprehensibility and comprehension time for these trials,
t(23.7) = 3.08, p = .005, but when P2TT was included as a
covariate, no evidence of the relationship between response
time and comprehensibility remained, t(58.1) = 1.50, p =
.138. For figurative items, then, it appears that P2TT likely
represents time used for computing a figurative
interpretation of the sentence.

Gaze Behavior 4. Second Pass Total Time (P2TT) Given
that a reader had refixated the critical word after having read
more of the sentence, was the total time spent refixating it
before responding related to rated comprehensibility? Total
comprehension time was included as a covariate because it
was highly correlated with P2TT. Whereas FFD and GPT
both distinguished similes from metaphors, understanding a
simile typically requires reaching a similar understanding to
the understanding required for a metaphor. When during
reading comprehension might this happen?
LMER models of P2TT for the figurative sentences
indicated that the relation between P2TT and
comprehensibility ratings was highly reliable for these two
forms, t(63.0) = 2.77, p = .007), but did not differ between
the figurative sentence forms, X2(1) = 0.37, p = .548. Thus,
P2TT appears to be similarly related to comprehensibility
ratings for similes and metaphors, as shown in Figure 4. In
contrast, LMER models of the comparison statements (i.e.,
similes and literal comparisons analyzed together) failed to
show reliable relationship between ratings and P2TT, t(39.9)

General Discussion

Acknowledgments

In Experiment 1, we observed that ratings of
comprehensibility for vehicles in simile or metaphor form
were highly correlated. The average figurative ratings from
Experiment 1 were used in Experiment 2 to try to predict
gaze variables related to the figurative vehicle during
reading. We reasoned that the similar comprehensibility
ratings of similes and metaphors observed in Experiment 1
reflected similar ease or difficulty with deriving the
appropriate figurative meaning of the vehicle; we sought
evidence of when this might unfold during reading.
Gaze patterns for metaphor vehicles, but not simile
vehicles, reflected rated figurative comprehensibility from
the very first fixation. Metaphor vehicles that were judged
less comprehensible were subjected to longer initial periods
of analysis. In contrast, similarly-rated similes, did not show
immediate effects. For similes, as for literal comparisons,
initial measures of processing time for their vehicles in
similes were unrelated to rated comprehensibility.
But simile processing resembled metaphor processing
during second-pass reading of the sentence. Both simile and
metaphor vehicles showed comprehension-related durations
of fixation. These second-pass durations were related to the
rated comprehensibility of the word in the sentence both for
metaphors and for similes. This pattern was not found for
literal comparisons.
The difference between similes and metaphors at first
fixation might be regarded as reflecting the weaker
pragmatic assertion involved in declaring that something is
like something rather than that it is something (RubioFernández, Geurts & Cummins, 2016). To say that
something is like something else implies that it is also
unlike it. In this sense similes are sensibly experienced as
weaker than metaphors at first pass, even if the ultimate
interpretation of what is being said about the topic
ultimately requires accessing a figurative or abstract
interpretation of the vehicle.
Overall, these data suggest that similes are initially treated
similarly to literal comparisons, consistent with the
arguments of Glucksberg and Haught (2006). However, the
second pass data and the ratings data both suggest that
sentence comprehension for simile forms still requires
identifying a figurative interpretation. We think this
supports Aristotle’s assertion of the figurative nature of
simile that is embedded within his longer discussion of
metaphor. Aristotle (400 BC/1991) wrote “A simile is also a
metaphor, for there is little difference.” This quote clearly
implies that metaphor (literally a “carrying-over” of
meaning) is the larger category.
Our study has used similes derived from metaphors. The
data show that reading such similes differs substantially
from reading their corresponding metaphors. However, the
data also support the idea that the interpretive demands for
the figurative vehicle may ultimately be similar in both
forms. This distinguishes simile from literal comparison.
