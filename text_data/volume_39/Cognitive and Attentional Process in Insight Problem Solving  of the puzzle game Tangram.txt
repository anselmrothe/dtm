                            Abstract
  The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a constraint
  relaxation which is followed by the transition to an
  appropriate representation in insight problem solving. The
  puzzle game “Tangram” was used as a new insight problem,
  in which problem-solvers were presented a silhouette and
  asked to make the same configuration by arranging 7 pieces.
  At the beginning, problem-solvers had a constraint allocating
  the pieces into a geometric shape, but then relaxed this to
  reach the correct configuration at a later stage of problem
  solving. Participants’ subjective assessments of their
  confidence to reach the solution predicted neither the
  constraint relaxation nor the successful problem solving.
  However, eye-tracking data suggested that the successful
  problem-solvers tended to search the problem space more
  widely than the unsuccessful-problem solvers.

   There is an agreement that inappropriate constraints for a

   Tangram has the advantages of allowing researchers to
monitor task performance of a problem solving requiring
insight. Nakano (2009) recorded protocols of participants
and movements of the pieces. His protocol data revealed
that the participants who could complete the task silhouette
had expressed an “Aha” experience before reaching the
correct configuration. Nakano (2009) found that the
participants tended to combine the pieces into a geometric
shape such as a square or a triangle. This tendency was
usually involved combinations of the 2 largest triangles
among the 7 pieces. Such the constraints will facilitate the
process to reach the solution, in the case that a correct
configuration includes geometric combination of the pieces
as a square or a triangle. For example, the task silhouette of
