which eludes any model built on the notion of delay
discounting.
One drawback of the tradeoff model, however, is its static
nature. As a result, it lacks an account of the dynamic
process leading to the explicit intertemporal choices.
Nevertheless, any decision is a result of some process that
unfolds in time. The characteristics of the process affect the
final decision as well as process-related variables such as
response time. Therefore, a static model provides only an
incomplete description of intertemporal choice, and an
account of the underlying dynamics is required for a more
comprehensive understanding thereof.
In this paper, we propose a modified tradeoff model of
intertemporal choice that has a dynamic structure and can
thus account for both choice and response time data. We
show that this dynamic tradeoff model can qualitatively
accommodate key findings in the literature regarding both
choice patterns and relationship between choices and
response times. In two model-comparison analyses, we
further show that the dynamic model can even outperform
promising competing models when fitting empirical data
quantitatively.

Abstract
The delay discounting perspective, which assumes an
alternative-wise processing of attribute information, has long
dominated research on intertemporal choice. Recent studies,
however, have suggested that intertemporal choice is based on
attribute-wise comparison. This line of research culminated in
the tradeoff model (Scholten & Read, 2010; Scholten, Read,
& Sanborn, 2014), which can accommodate most established
behavioral regularities in intertemporal choice. One drawback
of the tradeoff model, however, is that it is static, providing
no account of the dynamic process leading to a choice. Here
we develop a dynamic tradeoff model that can qualitatively
account for empirical findings in intertemporal choice
regarding not only choices but also response times. The
dynamic model also outperforms the original, static tradeoff
model when quantitatively fitting choices from representative
data sets, and even outperforms the best-performing dynamic
model derived from Decision Field Theory in Dai and
Busemeyer (2014) when fitting both choices and response
times.

Introduction
Many human decisions, mundane or momentous, involve
choices between outcomes that materialize at different times
in the future, ranging from dieting and exercising plans to
education and saving decisions. Research on such
intertemporal choices has a long history and has revealed
various behavioral regularities. For example, it was found
that large rewards suffer less proportional discounting than
small ones do (the magnitude effect; e.g., Green, Myerson,
& McFadden, 1997), and that people’s preference between
options that have different delays can reverse as time passes
(e.g., Green, Fristoe, & Myerson, 1994). Various descriptive
models have been developed to account for these empirical
phenomena. Among them, the tradeoff model (Scholten &
Read, 2010; Scholten, Read, & Sanborn, 2014) currently
appears to be one of the most promising models since it
provides a unified framework for qualitatively explaining a
majority of the empirical findings. Most crucially, it can
account for the nonadditivity in delay discounting (e.g.,

The Tradeoff Model
To account for intertemporal choice, research has for a long
time been mainly conceptualized using the notion of delay
discounting, according to which the delay of a reward
decreases its present subjective value. One major concern of
this approach has been to find the most appropriate form of
the discount function, which describes how subjective value
decreases with increased delay length. A critical assumption
in this endeavor is that each option has a discounted utility
or present value independent of other competing options.
Importantly, this predicts that intertemporal choice should
be transitive: if, among three options X, Y, and Z, one
chooses X over Y and Y over Z, then he or she should also
choose X over Z.
A series of studies by Read, Scholten, and colleagues,
however, demonstrated that the transitivity of intertemporal
choices is sometimes violated for a triple of options S, M,

(2)
𝜏
where τ represents diminishing absolute sensitivity to
differences in delay length, and

and L with increasing money amounts and delay lengths
(e.g., Scholten et al., 2014). For example, when facing
Option S of receiving $30 in one week, Option M of
receiving $35 in two weeks, and Option L of receiving $40
in three weeks, some people might choose Option S over
Option M, choose Option M over Option L, but choose
Option L over Option S. In each pair, one option has a
smaller but sooner reward (smaller-but-sooner, or SS,
option), and the other has a larger but later reward (largerbut-later, or LL, option). The cyclical choice pattern
suggests that such people prefer the SS options for adjacent
pairs of options (e.g., Option S vs. Option M), but the LL
option for the distant pair (Option S vs. Option L). By
contrast, others may instead choose the LL options for
adjacent pairs but the SS option for the distant pair. The
former cyclical pattern can be accounted for by assuming
that the amount of discounting associated with a given
difference in delay (i.e., the interval between one and three
weeks) is smaller when it is treated as a whole than when it
is divided into subintervals (e.g., two subintervals of one
week), whereas the latter implies the opposite. Together,
these patterns suggest nonadditivity in delay discounting.
To accommodate violation of transitivity in intertemporal
choice, several alternatives to discounting models were
developed, culminating in the tradeoff model. The key
difference between the tradeoff model and previous delay
discounting models lies in how attributes are assumed to be
processed. In contrast to the notion of alternative-wise delay
discounting, the tradeoff model assumes that people process
attribute information in intertemporal choice by comparing
options within each attribute, and that advantages on one
attribute (e.g., reward amount) are traded off against the
disadvantages on the other attribute (e.g., waiting time).
Such an attribute-based approach has been shown to better
capture the empirical data quantitatively than the traditional
alternative-based approach reflected in the delay
discounting paradigm (Dai & Busemeyer, 2014).
According to the tradeoff model, when choosing between
an SS option with a money amount of x S and a delay length
of tS, and an LL option with a money amount of xL and a
delay length of tL, a decision maker (DM) compares the
effective compensation with the effective interval. Let v(x)
denote a value function and w(t) denote a time weighting
function. The effective compensation is defined as the
difference in the value of the two money amounts, that is,
v(xL) – v(xS), and the effective interval is defined as the
difference in the weighted delay lengths, that is, w(tL) w(tS). In addition, the effective interval is assumed to be
weighed against the effective compensation by a tradeoff
function Q(w(tL) – w(tS)) to make the decision. The SS
option should be preferred when Q(w(tL) – w(tS)) is larger
than v(xL) – v(xS), and the LL option should be preferred
when Q(w(tL) – w(tS)) is smaller than v(xL) – v(xS).
In the latest version of the tradeoff model (Scholten et al.,
2014), the subjective value of a money amount x is given by
1
𝑣(𝑥) = log(1 + 𝛾𝑥),
(1)

𝜅

𝑄(𝑤(𝑡𝐿 ) − 𝑤(𝑡𝑆 )) = log (1 + 𝛼 (

𝑤(𝑡𝐿)−𝑤(𝑡𝑆 ) 𝜗

𝛼

𝜗

) ), (3)

in which κ > 0 represents delay sensitivity, ϑ > 1 represents
superadditivity, and α > 0 represents subadditivity. To
accommodate probabilistic choice patterns (Dai &
Busemeyer, 2014), it is further assumed that the choice
probability of the LL option over the SS option is given by a
ratio rule, that is,
Pr(LL|{SS, LL}) = (

𝑣(𝑥𝐿 )−𝑣(𝑥𝑆 )

)1/𝜖 ,

𝑄(𝑤(𝑡𝐿 )−𝑤(𝑡𝑆 ))

(4)

where ε > 0 represents response noise. With these
assumptions, the models can accommodate a large number
of behavioral regularities in intertemporal choice, such the
aforementioned magnitude effect, preference reversal, and
nonadditivity in delay discounting.

A Dynamic Version of the Tradeoff Model
One important aspect of intertemporal choice that the
tradeoff model cannot explain is the recent finding
regarding a relationship between choices and response times
in intertemporal choice (Dai & Busemeyer, 2014).
Specifically, it was found that pairs of options that give rise
to extreme choice proportions tend to be associated with
faster response times than pairs with more moderate choice
proportions. We refer to this relationship as the fast-andextreme effect. Because the tradeoff model is silent on the
temporal dynamics underlying intertemporal choice, it lacks
an account of this finding. Here we present a modification
of the model to equip it with a dynamic structure while
keeping its key assumption of attribute-based processing.
As the original tradeoff model, we assume that a DM
performs intertemporal tradeoffs by comparing the effective
intervals with the effective compensations. However, unlike
the latest implementation of the model (Scholten et al.,
2014), in the modified version we assume a more
straightforward comparison that goes without the mediation
of the tradeoff function. Specifically, we assume that v(x L) –
v(xS) is directly compared to w(tL) – w(tS). To accommodate
the probabilistic nature of intertemporal choice, we make
two further assumptions. First, both the effective
compensation and the effective interval are assumed to be
random, denoted as V(xL) – V(xS) and W(tL) – W(tS),
respectively, to reflect the uncertainty in these subjective
evaluations. Second, it is assumed that a decision is made
when the absolute difference between the two (random)
quantities is larger than a positive value; otherwise the DM
acquires another sample of the effective compensation and
interval without accumulating preferences from previous
samples. This process continues until a decision can be
made. Note that the first assumption echoes the notion of
random utility in economics (e.g., McFadden, 1973), while

𝛾

266

the second assumption is built on the concept of
discrimination threshold in psychophysics (Fechner, 1860).
To derive quantitative predictions, we assume that the
effective compensation and effective interval follow
independent normal distributions, with respective variance
proportional to the mean of the distribution. As a result, the
difference between effective compensation and effective
interval is also normally distributed with
𝜇 = [𝑣(𝑥𝐿 ) − 𝑣(𝑥𝑆 )] − [𝑤(𝑡𝐿 ) − 𝑤(𝑡𝑆 )],
(5)
and
𝜎 = √𝑐{[𝑣(𝑥𝐿 ) − 𝑣(𝑥𝑆 )] + [𝑤(𝑡𝐿 ) − 𝑤(𝑡𝑆 )]},
(6)
in which c is a proportional constant to be estimated from
the data.1 Given the assumption of non-accumulative
sampling until a sufficiently large difference is obtained, the
choice probability of the LL option is given by
Pr(𝐿𝐿|{𝑆𝑆, 𝐿𝐿}) =

Explanatory Power of the Dynamic Tradeoff Model
Because the dynamic tradeoff model inherits the assumption
of attribute-based processing, it can accommodate several
key findings in intertemporal choice, including the
magnitude effect, the common ratio effect, and the common
difference effect. According to the magnitude effect, larger
amounts appear to be discounted at a lower rate than smaller
ones. For example, if a DM is indifferent between receiving
$100 now and receiving $200 in a year, suggesting an
annual discount rate of 50%, then the same person would
tend to prefer receiving $2000 in a year to receiving $1000
now, suggesting an annual discount rate lower than 50%.
From an attribute-based perspective, this change in discount
rate can be easily explained by noticing that the effective
compensation between $1000 and $2000 is much larger than
that between $100 and $200, whereas the effective intervals
for the two choice scenarios are just the same.

in which Φ represents the cumulative distribution function
of a standard normal distribution, and δ denotes the smallest
positive difference (i.e., the positive discrimination
threshold) required to make a decision.
Because the modified model goes without the tradeoff
function and the related ratio choice rule (which are critical
for the original model to accommodate the nonadditivity in
delay discounting), an alternative mechanism is required in
order to retain this capability. To this end, we further
assume that the discrimination thresholds for choosing the
SS and LL options (i.e., δS and δL) are different, echoing the
general idea of decision bias in the literature of choice
models (e.g., Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993).2 In this case,

To derive predictions on response time distributions for
the modified tradeoff model, we assume that the time it
takes to assess a sample follows a Gamma distribution with
a scale parameter of θ and a shape parameter of 2. Because
empirical distributions of response time tend to be singlepeaked (rather than monotonously decreasing), we fix the
shape parameter at 2 instead of 1. The total response time is
assumed to be the sum of time(s) required for all samples
drawn until a decision is made, plus a nondecision time.
With these assumptions, we analytically derive joint
probability density functions for both choices and response
times (see Dai, Pleskac, & Pachur, 2016). Such analytical
solutions are usually not available for other dynamic choice
models. This ends our description of the modified tradeoff
model (hereafter the dynamic tradeoff model). See Figure 1
for the dynamic structure of the model.

Figure 1: The dynamic structure of the modified tradeoff
model of intertemporal choice.
The common ratio effect (i.e., the delay duration effect in
Dai and Busemeyer [2014]) implies that increasing the
delays of both options proportionally would shift people’s
preference toward the SS option. In this case, the change in
attribute values produces a larger effective interval while
keeping the same effective compensation, with the observed
effect as a natural result. Finally, the common difference
effect suggests that postponing both options by the same
length would increase people’s preference to the LL option.
This effect is accounted for by the attribute-based approach
together with the nonlinearity of the time weighting function
(i.e., w(t)). The particular form of the function (i.e.,
Equation 2) entails that increasing both delays by the same
length would lead to a smaller effective interval and thus
shift preference towards the LL option.
With the assumption of distinct discrimination thresholds
for choosing the SS and LL options, it can be shown that the
dynamic tradeoff model can produce nonadditivity in delay
discounting demonstrated as a violation of transitivity.

The model performance results (reported in a later section)
were virtually the same or worse when the standard deviation
instead of variance of the relative distribution was set to be
proportional to the mean and/or the tradeoff parameter κ in the
static model was incorporated into w(t) as a multiplicative constant
to put subjective value and time weight on the same scale.

Mathematical proof on the necessity of this assumption for
accommodating the relevant phenomena is available upon request.

Specifically, when the probabilistic nature of choice is
considered, a violation of transitivity is usually formalized
as a violation of weak stochastic transitivity (WST;
Davidson & Marschak, 1959). WST requires that for a triple
of options X, Y, and Z, if P XY ≥ 0.5, PYZ ≥ 0.5, then PXZ
should also be no smaller than 0.5, in which P AB represents
the probability of choose option A over option B in a binary
choice. In other words, a violation of WST occurs when P XZ
< 0.5 given the two preconditions. This is consistent with
the dynamic tradeoff model. For example, for the
aforementioned triple of options with increasing money
amounts and delay lengths, the dynamic tradeoff model
would predict PSM = 0.53, PML = 0.58, but PSL = 0.35 when γ
= 0.05, τ = 0.01, c = 1, δS = 0.01, and δL = 2, violating WST.
Besides showing intransitive intertemporal choices
produced by sub- or superadditivity in delay discounting,
Scholten et al. (2014) also suggested a more intricate pattern
of intransitive intertemporal choice called relative
nonadditivity. Specifically, intransitive intertemporal
choices tend to show subadditivity when differences
between delay lengths are large relative to the differences
between money amounts, and show superadditivity when
the differences between delay lengths are large relative to
those between money amounts. To account for this pattern,
Scholten et al. defined additivity in delay discounting in
terms of a product rule of choice odds and showed that this
definition naturally led to the pattern of relative
nonadditivity. According to this definition, subadditivity
occurs when
Ω𝐿𝑆 > Ω𝑀𝑆 × Ω𝐿𝑀 ,
(9)
in which ΩXY denotes the choice odds of option X over
option Y, that is, PXY/PYX, and superadditivity occurs when
Ω𝐿𝑆 < Ω𝑀𝑆 × Ω𝐿𝑀 .
(10)
According to Scholten et al., the ratio choice rule of the
static tradeoff model is the key component for explaining
relative nonadditivity.
The dynamic tradeoff model, which goes without the ratio
choice rule, can account for the same phenomenon.
According to the dynamic model, ΩMS and ΩLM tend to be
smaller than 1 when differences between delay lengths are
large relative to the differences between money amounts, so
is ΩLS. Given the choice rule of the dynamic model (i.e.,
Equation 7 for equal discrimination thresholds for choosing
the SS and LL options, or Equation 8 for distinct
discrimination threshold), it can be shown that the same
conditions tend to render Ω𝐿𝑆 > Ω𝑀𝑆 × Ω𝐿𝑀 . For example,
for a triple of options X, Y, and Z with increasing reward
amounts of 10, 11, and 12 dollars, and increasing delay
lengths of 5, 10, and 15 days, ΩMS = 0.074, ΩLM = 0.105,
but ΩLS = 0.026 > 0.008 = ΩMS × ΩLM when γ = τ = 0.05, c
= 1, and δS = δL = 0.05. To the contrary, with the same set of
model parameters but another triple of options X’, Y’, and
Z’ with increasing reward amounts of 10, 20, and 30 dollars,
and the same increasing delay lengths of 5, 10, and 15 days,
ΩMS = 3.15, ΩLM = 2.30, but ΩLS = 4.14 < 7.26 = ΩMS × ΩLM.
In the first triple, the differences between delay lengths are

large relative to those between reward amounts, whereas in
the second triple, the latter are large relative to the former.
Besides accounting for major empirical regularities in
choice, the dynamic tradeoff model can also accommodate
the fast-and-extreme effect, one robust relationship between
choices and responses in intertemporal choice (Dai &
Busemeyer, 2014). According to the model, the more
strongly the expected difference between effective
compensation and effective interval differs from zero, the
higher the probability of obtaining a difference large enough
μ−δ
in each sample and the further away ratio of Φ( ) to
𝜎

−μ−δ

Φ(
) is from 1. The former leads to faster response
𝜎
times because fewer samples are required to trigger a
decision, whereas the latter leads to more extreme choice
proportions.
In summary, the dynamic tradeoff model can qualitatively
accommodate all the major findings in intertemporal choice
that are captured by the static tradeoff model; in addition, it
can also qualitatively accommodate the fast-and-extreme
effect, a prominent relationship between choices and
response times that eludes the static tradeoff model. In the
next section, we show further that the dynamic model can
also quantitatively fit empirical data better than promising
competing models.

Quantitative Model Comparisons
We conducted two model-comparison analyses to show the
power of the dynamic tradeoff model in quantitatively
fitting empirical data. First, we compared it with the latest,
full version of the static tradeoff model (Scholten et al.,
2014) in terms of their performance in fitting choice data
only. Second, we compared the dynamic tradeoff model
with the best-performing model in Dai and Busemeyer
(2014)—which is built on Decision Field Theory (DFT;
Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993)—with regard to their
performance in fitting choice and response time data
simultaneously. The DFT model assumes a sequential
sampling approach and an attention shift mechanism for
making intertemporal choices. Specifically, it suggests that a
DM attends to either the money or the delay attribute at a
time and evaluates the relevant difference between options
to update his or her preference. This preference updating
process continues over time as the DM switches attention
between the two attributes until the preference level of one
option reaches a preference threshold to trigger a decision.
See Dai and Busemeyer for more details of the DFT model.

Method
We used data from three representative empirical studies to
assess the performance of the models in accounting for
individual-level data. The first data set came from Study 1
in Dai (2014), in which half or all the choice questions for
each individual had an immediate SS option. The second
data set came from Dai (2016), which focused on the
nonadditivity in delay discounting and involved only
delayed SS and LL options. The third data set came from

268

Study 3 in Dai and Busemeyer (2014), which examined the
magnitude effect, the common ratio effect, and the common
difference effect, and again involved only delayed SS and
LL options. All three data sets contained participants who
showed the fast-and-extreme effect. A total of 138
participants contributed data to the analysis: 61 from the
first data set, 40 from the second, and 37 from the third. In
all three studies, the choice questions for each participant
were adjusted to suit the time preference level of the
individual, and each question was presented multiple times.
In this way, moderate choice proportions could be induced
at an individual level to better distinguish probabilistic
models from one another.
The models were fitted to individual data from each data
set using the predicted functions of choice probability or
joint probability density functions of choices and response
times. We used the SIMPLEX algorithm implemented in the
fminsearch function of Matlab to find the maximumlikelihood parameter estimates of each model, which was
then used to calculate the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC; Schwarz, 1978). The BIC is a common measure for
relative model performance and expresses a model’s ability
to capture the data, taking into account its complexity
(based on the number of free parameters). A lower BIC
indicates a better balance between goodness of fit and model
complexity and thus a more desirable model.
To evaluate the absolute performance of the dynamic
tradeoff model, we compared its predictions with the
observed data in terms of the fast-and-extreme effect.
Specifically, we categorized all repeatedly presented
questions into five equal-interval groups regarding observed
choice proportions of the LL options and then calculated the
mean observed and predicted response times for each
question. The observed and predicted response times within
each bin were then averaged to obtain overall measures of
the observed and predicted results regarding response time.
The fast-and-extreme effect suggests that mean response
times associated with moderate choice proportions should
be longer than those with extreme choice proportions.

proportions (i.e., p < 0.2 or p > 0.8) and those with moderate
choice proportions (i.e., 0.2 ≤ p ≤ 0.8) was statistically
significant for both observed (t = -9.83, p < .001) and
predicted data (t = -5.08, p < .001).

Discussion
The static tradeoff model (Scholten et al., 2014) represents
one of the most successful cognitive models to describe
intertemporal choice. However, up to now there have been
no attempts to examine how this modeling approach could
be extended to also account for the dynamics of the
underlying decision process. Here we developed a dynamic
modification of the tradeoff model, which can accommodate
not only key choice regularities but also the response time
data and prominent regularities therein (e.g., the fast-andextreme effect). We also showed that this modified model
quantitatively outperforms the original static tradeoff model
when fitting choice data and the best-performing DFT
model in Dai and Busemeyer (2014) when fitting both

choice and response time data. The model’s ability to
capture the data both qualitatively and quantitatively
underlines the value of developing dynamic accounts of
intertemporal choice for a better understanding of this
central topic in both psychology and economics.

Conclusion
Most existing models of intertemporal choice, including the
original tradeoff model, are static and thus lack a proper
account of the dynamic processes leading to a choice. In this
paper, we showed how the static tradeoff model can be
modified into a dynamic one with a general structure built
on the concepts of random utility and discrimination
threshold. The advantages of the dynamic tradeoff model
are demonstrated by its capability to qualitatively
accommodate empirical findings and its better performance
in quantitative model comparisons. Future studies should
further explore the capacity of this approach for explaining
more phenomena in intertemporal choice and beyond.

A General Framework for Developing Dynamic
Models of Choice
When developing the dynamic tradeoff model, we invoked
and combined two time-honored concepts: the notion of
random utility in economics and the concept of
discrimination thresholds in psychology. Combining these
concepts seems to offer a promising, but so far neglected,
approach to developing dynamic choice models, and we
argue that it could be applied to transform existing static
models of choice also in other domains. For example, it
could be applied to extend static models of risky choice into
dynamic ones as long as the corresponding models can
reasonably offer a measurement of the relative attractiveness
of each option and the variability thereof. With dynamic
models, both choice and response time data from empirical
studies can be utilized to compare competing models for a
more powerful model selection. Dai, Pleskac, and Pachur
(2016) conduct a more comprehensive development and
analysis of such a random-utility-with-discriminationthreshold (RUDT) framework, and compare it to other
dynamic approaches to modeling intertemporal choice.

Future Directions
In addition to the fast-and-extreme effect discovered in Dai
and Busemeyer (2014), recent studies (Dai, 2014) have
suggested another striking but less common relationship
between choices and response times in intertemporal choice.
Specifically, it was found that, within each choice question,
the option chosen more frequently also tended to be chosen
more quickly than the other option. Unfortunately, this fastand-frequent effect poses a severe challenge to both the
best-performing DFT model in Dai and Busemeyer and the
dynamic tradeoff model developed here. Both models
predict that the conditional response time distribution given
choosing one option should be identical to that given
choosing the other option. As a consequence, the option
chosen more frequently is predicted to have the same mean
response time as the other option, contradicting the fast-andfrequent effect. It is possible, however, to modify the
dynamic tradeoff model to accommodate this effect (Dai et
al., 2016). Specifically, by assuming that the discrimination
thresholds are not fixed across successive samples but
converging, it is possible to account for the pattern. To put
DFT models of intertemporal choice on equal footing,
attempts should be made to improve them as well. Future
research should explore alternative forms of the tradeoff
model under the RUDT structure and compare them with
appropriate competing models to examine the performance
of the dynamic tradeoff model.
