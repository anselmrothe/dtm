   Because the modified model goes without the tradeoff
function and the related ratio choice rule (which are critical
for the original model to accommodate the nonadditivity in
delay discounting), an alternative mechanism is required in
order to retain this capability. To this end, we further
assume that the discrimination thresholds for choosing the
SS and LL options (i.e., δS and δL) are different, echoing the
general idea of decision bias in the literature of choice

complexity and thus a more desirable model.
   To evaluate the absolute performance of the dynamic
tradeoff model, we compared its predictions with the
observed data in terms of the fast-and-extreme effect.
Specifically, we categorized all repeatedly presented
questions into five equal-interval groups regarding observed
choice proportions of the LL options and then calculated the
mean observed and predicted response times for each
question. The observed and predicted response times within
each bin were then averaged to obtain overall measures of
the observed and predicted results regarding response time.
The fast-and-extreme effect suggests that mean response
times associated with moderate choice proportions should
be longer than those with extreme choice proportions.
