staying or switching has the highest probability of winning
depends on which door is initially selected and which door is
opened. The optimal strategy for this version is to first select
the least likely alternative then switch away from it after a
door is opened. Granberg gave participants 60 trials of either
equal or unequal probability 4-door versions of the MHD. On
the first trial only 11% switched in the equal-probability
condition but even fewer (7%) switched in the unequal-
probability condition, despite there being a 75% chance of
winning (on average) if switching in the later condition. Over
60 trials the switch rates improved in both conditions but at
similar rates. Participants in unequal-probability condition

participants would be expected to get these probabilities
