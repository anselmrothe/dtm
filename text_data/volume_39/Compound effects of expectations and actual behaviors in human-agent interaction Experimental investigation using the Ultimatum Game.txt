   Interestingly, respondents tend to reject proposals that are
not distributed fairly, even when doing so results in a loss of
profit for both players (Guth & Tietz, 1990). In the current
study, it is assumed that if the respondent (participant) per-

accordingly, such as by rejecting proposals and abandoning
profit as in human-human studies. We controlled the expecta-
