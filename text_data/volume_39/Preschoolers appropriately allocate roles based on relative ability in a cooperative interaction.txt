test. Children allocated roles in a way most likely to
their joint success. Given previous work showing that
five-year-olds, but not 3-year-olds allocate roles based
on available resources (Warneken et al., 2014), we also
asked whether the likelihood of participants allocating
roles based on ability increased with age. We found no
evidence of an age effect in the present task, β=-
.004(.75), p=.995, suggesting that even children as
young as 3.5 years can allocate roles in a cooperative
interaction given inferred differences in ability.
   Although there was no significant difference in
children’s ability to allocate roles effectively in each
condition, Fisher’s Exact Test, p=.31, it is intriguing

Both the Easy Game and the Hard Game were fairly
difficult for the preschoolers. Children scored a zero out
of four practice trials 32% of the time across both
games. As such, the decision of some children in the
Younger Other condition to allocate the Easy Game to
themselves may make sense: given that a toddler is
unlikely to do better, and the joint goal may thus seem
out of reach, it is reasonable for children to choose the
game at which they themselves are more likely to
succeed. Indeed, when partnered with a younger child,
the majority of preschoolers opted for a game that,
while increasing the probability of achieving the joint
goal, decreased the probability of their own success.
