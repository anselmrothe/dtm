humans are able to absorb an underlying pattern based on
statistical regularities (Saffran, Aslin & Newport, 1996).
This phenomenon of learning through passive observation is
called statistical learning and it has been observed in
humans of all ages including neonates (Gervain, Macagno,
Cogoi, Pena, & Mehler, 2008), infants (Saffran et al., 1996;
Aslin, Saffran & Newport, 1998), and adults (Saffran,
Johnson, Aslin, & Newport, 1999, inter alia).
   Statistical learning is generally understood by assuming
that learners are able to extract information from the
environment by subconsciously recording and computing
statistical relationships in sequences. By predicting
upcoming stimuli from prior stimuli, for example, learners

probability of “x given y” (Aslin et al., 1998). These
