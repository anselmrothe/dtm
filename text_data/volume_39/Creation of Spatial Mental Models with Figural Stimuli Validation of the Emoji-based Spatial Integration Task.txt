Participants
A total of 161 (96 female) participants between the ages of
18 and 39 (M = 20.32, SD = 1.67) with normal or
corrected-to-normal vision were tested and retained for
analysis in the current experiment. They were paid for their
participation. Two additional participants were excluded for
exhibiting a pattern of not following study directions across
multiple tasks.
