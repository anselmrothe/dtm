possible that verbal and non-verbal channels have similar
degrees of burstiness, which would be consistent with
previous work suggesting a strong intrinsic relationship.
However, if the channels exhibit different degrees of
burstiness, such results would suggest a more complex
relationship between verbal and non-verbal communication.
