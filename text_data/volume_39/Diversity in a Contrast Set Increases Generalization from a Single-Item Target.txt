Abstract: Four experiments explored the effect of diversity of contrasting negative evidence on inductive inferences drawn
from a single-item target. In Experiments 1 and 2, we found that increasing the diversity of a contrast set led people to infer
that a target exemplar corresponded to a higher level category and led to greater generalization of a novel property associated
with the target. Further, we demonstrated two boundary conditions in which the effect only occurred when the contrast set
was consistent with a higher level category that both united the contrast exemplars and distinguished them from the target
(Experiment 4) and when contrast and target shared an obvious parent category (Experiment 5). Taken together, these findings
demonstrate that increasing the diversity of a contrast increases generalization from a target, but only if the contrast set is drawn
from a single category that excludes, but shares a common parent with, the target.
