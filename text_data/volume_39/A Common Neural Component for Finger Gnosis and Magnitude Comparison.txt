functionality. The groups of neurons on the right store the
individual pointer values p1, p2, etc. They are recurrently
connected such that they will have stable firing patterns over
time (i.e. whatever pattern of firing is present right now will
cause a similar firing pattern in the near future).
   The connections from x to the channels and from the
channels to the pointers are all set such that the neurons
simply pass along the value without altering it. That is, if
we input a particular value x, this will cause a particular
(and unique) firing pattern in channel 1 and channel 2.
These in turn will cause particular firing patterns in pointer
1 and pointer 2. If x is removed (i.e. set to zero), then the
pointer patterns will stay as they were. Thus, they

   While the system described above behaves as desired,
note that it is not perfect. The neurons in channel 1 and
channel 2 are not perfectly inhibited. Also, the neurons in
pointer 1 and pointer 2 do not perfectly maintain exactly the
desired firing pattern. This is as expected, as neurons only
approximate the desired functions.          We can now test
whether the resulting model can still perform the two tasks,
and whether the errors made by the model due to these
imperfections are comparable to the errors made by people.
