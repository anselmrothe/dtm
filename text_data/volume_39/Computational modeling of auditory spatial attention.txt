matching the limitations in the number of actions that can be

attention is limited (Allport, 1989; Posner, 1978). Spatial

and reactive control. According to Braver’s dual mechanisms
framework (Braver, 2012), proactive control generates a
sustained attentional bias in accordance with task goals, such
as focusing on a pianist about to begin their recital. Reactive
control, as the name suggests, is attentional orienting in
response to a stimulus, such as if the pianist plays their first
chord and everybody realizes that the piano is out of tune. In
our model the goal map is the mechanism for proactive
control. The spatial focus of the goal map can also be
redirected in response to stimuli, and so could have a role in
reactive control too. In contrast, the saliency map codes for
reactive control. The relation between the saliency map and
proactive control is only indirect. The focus of the saliency
map is designed to be away from the goal map focus, thus
any proactive shifts in the goal map focus will consequently
lead to a similar shift in the saliency map focus.

the fit for the 0° standard is even better than the ±90°
standards, but this may relate to the truncated range of
locations on either side (±90°).
Standard deviation parameters The range of spatial
attention bias for the goal and saliency maps was quantified
with separate standard deviation parameters (Figure 5).
When only the goal map was included in the model the best
fits had standard deviations of ~100°, which produced a
gradual decrease of attentional bias from the standard
location. As shown above, only including the goal map
produced a poor fit to the behavioral data. In all models with
goal and saliency maps the standard deviations had, large,
progressive reductions from standard locations on the left, to
midline, and to the right (p<.001). This pattern was evident
for both the goal and saliency map SD parameters. Analysis         Figure 6. Attention bias level results in the free level models.
