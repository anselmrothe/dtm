Jazayeri & Shadlen, 2010; Lejeune & Wearden, 2009; Moon
& Anderson 2013). More interestingly, as a result of the
central tendency bias, a stimulus duration tends to be
reproduced as longer if it occurs as a member of a longer
range (e.g., 1000 ms in the range of 847 - 1200 ms) than as a
member of a shorter range (1000 ms in the range of 671 1023 ms) (Jazayeri & Shadlen, 2010), a phenomenon which
we refer to as the range bias.
Jazayeri and Shadlen (2010) argue that the central tendency
and the range bias occur because time estimation follows
Bayesian inference: as memories of durations (indeed
magnitudes in general) are inherently noisy (Gallistel &
Gelman, 2000), people resort to their prior belief about how
likely a duration is in order to calibrate their estimate of the
magnitude of a perceived duration. In Bayesian inference, a
posterior belief is the product of the “likelihood” (reflecting
the variability of perceptions of a given duration) and the
prior, and this posterior (the estimated duration) is necessarily
pulled toward the mean of the prior distribution (e.g., the
midpoint of experienced durations), hence the central
tendency and the range bias. Such a Bayesian inference
account of timing has been endorsed in many subsequent
related research on timing behaviour, e.g., animal timing (Li
& Dudman, 2014), time prediction (Griffiths & Tenenbaum,
2011; Di Luca & Rhodes, 2016) and delay discounting
(McGuire & Kable, 2012) (see Shi, Church & Meck, 2014,
for a review). Indeed, Petzschner et al. (2015) argue that
Bayesian inference is used in estimating all kinds of physical
magnitudes and can accommodate a wide range of
behavioural effects in magnitude estimation, central tendency
included.
A common assumption in Bayesian accounts of timing
(and indeed magnitude estimation in general) is that people
make an optimal estimate about how long the perceived
duration is by incorporating their belief about how likely a
duration is as a function of previously presented magnitudes;
in a time reproduction task, they then reproduce an amount of
time to match this estimate (Cicchini et al., 2012; Jazayeri &
Shadlen, 2010; Di Luca & Rhodes, 2016). These accounts
thus assume that the estimation of a perceived duration makes
reference to the previously perceived durations.
However, these accounts ignore another source of
information that participants can rely upon when trying to
optimally reproduce durations, i.e. their past experience with

Abstract
The estimation of duration has been shown to follow Bayesian
inference, where people use their prior belief to calibrate the
estimation. This explains timing biases such as the range bias
where a duration is reproduced as longer when previously
encountered durations were longer than shorter. However, it is
unclear whether prior belief is based on previously perceived
or reproduced durations. In 4 experiments, we show that the
range bias occurs between short and long reproduction ranges
but not between short and long perception ranges. Further
analyses also show that the prior is updated by the most recent
reproduced (but not perceived) duration. Together these results
support a task-oriented Bayesian inference account of time
reproduction, where people use the perceived duration and
their past reproduction experience to make an inference about
how much time to reproduce.

Introduction
The mind is good at estimating quantitative dimensions of
the physical world: we are able to estimate how much time
has elapsed, how much distance has been traveled, how large
an area is, etc. Indeed, our superb capacity to quantify things
enables us to better adapt to the environment. However, these
quantitative intuitions are not without errors. Systematic
biases in human magnitude estimation have been identified
(for reviews see Poulton, 1979, and Petzschner, Glasauer, &
Stephan, 2015). Of these, the most robust is probably the bias
of central tendency (Hollingworth, 1910), a phenomenon
which has also been known by a variety of other names (e.g.,
contraction, regression effect, regression toward the mean).
Central tendency refers to the observation that people tend to
make estimates closer to the mean of the magnitudes to be
estimated, leading to the (relative) overestimation of lower
magnitudes in the stimulus set and underestimation of higher
magnitudes. A central tendency bias has been observed in the
estimation of distance (Jou et al., 2004; Radvansky et al.,
1995), brightness (Fotios & Cheal, 2007), weight (Jones &
Hunter, 1982), and loudness (Algom & Marks, 1990), to
mention a few. In particular, the central tendency bias has
been most often observed in the estimation of time intervals,
with the tendency for people to relatively overestimate
shorter durations and underestimate longer durations
(Bausenhart, Dyjas, & Ulrich 2014; Gu & Meck, 2011;

reproduced durations. According to this alternative account,
instead of making an estimate of a perceived duration and
then use this estimate to guide time reproduction, people
directly make an estimate about how long the reproduced
duration should be. In this task-oriented inference, people
make use of their past reproduction experience rather than
their past perception experience; after all, when one is to
reproduce a duration, the history of the reproduced durations
may provide a better constraint for optimally determining
how much time to reproduce.
The current study investigates whether people resort to
previous perception or reproduction experience as the prior
in their inferences. To do so, we take advantage of the range
bias (a duration is reproduced as longer if it is placed in a
context of long than short stimulus durations). If people use
their perception experience to calibrate their time estimation,
then we should expect the range bias to occur between
contexts of long vs. short perceived durations, even when the
context of reproduced durations is kept constant. If instead
people use their reproduction experience in their inference,
we should expect the range bias to occur between contexts of
long vs. short reproduced durations, even when the context of
perceived durations is kept constant.

each block, every stimulus duration was presented twice,
either both as reproduction or comparison trial. Half of the
comparison trials used a shorter comparison duration and the
other half had a longer one. Trials in each block were
presented in an individually randomized order. In total, there
were 180 experimental trials.
Procedure. The experiment was run on a desktop using EPrime 2.0. Participants sat about 50 cm away from the
monitor. The experiment began with a practice session of 4
trials (2 reproduction and 2 comparison trials) followed by
the main experiment. In a trial, a black cross (Courier New
48) was presented for a stimulus duration, followed by a
blank screen of 300 ms. Then, a cue (an asterisk “*” or the
phrase “第二段时间”, meaning “second duration”) was
presented. An asterisk informed participants to reproduce the
stimulus duration by holding down the spacebar for the same
duration. At the press of the spacebar, the asterisk turned into
three asterisks which remained on screen until the release of
the spacebar. The phrase “第二段时间” informed
participants to compare the first (stimulus) duration with an
upcoming (comparison) duration. The text cue stayed on
screen for 1 s and was replaced by a blank screen of 300 ms.
The comparison duration was then presented with a blue
cross (Courier New 48), followed by a blank screen of 300
ms. Then a judgment screen was displayed asking
participants to decide whether the first (stimulus) or second
(comparison) duration was longer by pressing the “F” or “J”
key.

Experiment 1
Methods
Participants. 32 volunteers (24 females, 20.3 ±1.6 in age)
from the South China Normal University community
volunteered for a small monetary reward. Participants in this
experiment (and indeed in each experiment reported here) did
not take part in any other experiment, though participants for
all the experiments came from the same participant pool.
These participants (and also those in other experiments) had
normal or corrected-to-normal vision and received a small
monetary reward for their participation
Design. We manipulated the reproduction context while
keeping the perception context constant. To do this, we used
an alternative-task paradigm where participants perceived a
duration and then, upon a cue, either reproduced the stimulus
duration or compared it to a new duration. Participants were
presented with a set of short durations (600 – 2200 in steps
of 200 ms) a set of long durations (1800 – 3400 in steps of
200 ms), all interleaved. Half of the participants reproduced
the short durations and compared the long durations; the other
half did the opposite (i.e. reproducing long durations and
comparing short durations). Note that, in such a design, while
the two groups of participants differed in their reproduction
contexts, they had identical perception contexts. Critically,
the two reproduction contexts overlapped in three stimulus
durations (1800, 2000, 2200 ms), which allowed us to
determine whether different reproduction contexts lead to a
range bias, even when the perception context was kept
constant.
Materials. For each of the 18 durations, a shorter (0.1 log
shorter) and a longer (0.1 log longer) comparison duration
was created. Each participant completed 5 blocks of trials. In

Results and discussion
As the comparison data does not address our theoretical
interest, to save space, we only report analyses on the
reproductions. We first excluded as outliers reproductions
that were 1/3 or 3 times the stimulus duration, leading to the
loss of 2% (65 reproductions) of the data (this trimming

193

criterion was adopted for all experiments reported in this
study). For the remaining data, a participant’s mean
reproduction for each stimulus duration was computed. We
compared reproductions for the three overlapping stimulus
durations (1800, 2000, and 2200 ms) between the two
reproduction contexts. An ANOVA with reproduction
context as a between-participant factor and stimulus duration
as a within-participant continuous variable revealed a
significant main effect of reproduction context (F(1,30) =
12.41, p = .001, η2 = .29): durations were reproduced for
longer in the long than the short reproduction context (see
Fig. 1). Reproduced durations increased as a function of the
stimulus duration (F(1,30) = 72.03, p < .001, η2 = .71) and did
not significantly interact with reproduction context (F(1,30) =
1.44, p = .240, η2 = .05).
The main effect of reproduction context suggested a range
bias in the reproduction of the overlapping durations: even
when the perception context was kept constant, durations
were reproduced as longer when prior reproductions were
longer. Such a reproduction range bias is inconsistent with
previous Bayesian inference accounts which posit that, to
estimate a duration, people use their memory of the perceived
duration and experience of previously perceived durations.
Instead, the results suggest that people make use of their
experience of previously reproduced durations in order to
calibrate their reproductions.
In Experiment 2, we aimed to replicate the reproduction
range bias using a within-participant design. In particular, we
distinguished the long and short reproduction contexts using
different modalities of reproduction: for half of the
participants, people reproduce long durations with motor
reproduction and short durations with an auditory
reproduction (see below); for the other half, the paring was
reversed. If reproduction experience calibrates duration
reproduction, we should again expect a range bias for
overlapping durations between the two reproduction
contexts.

Materials. As in Experiment 1, there were 5 blocks of
trials and each block contained two occurrences of each of
the 18 stimulus durations (i.e. 36 trials in each block). Trials
in each block were presented in an individually randomized
order. For auditory reproduction, a 10s sine-wave pure tone
sampled at a rate of 44100 Hz was created using Audacity.
Procedure. The experimental setting and overall
experimental procedure were the same as those in
Experiment 1, except that participants always reproduced a
stimulus duration. After a cross was presented for a stimulus
duration, followed by a blank, an image of a keyboard (as a
cue for motor reproduction) or a mouse (as a cue for auditory
reproduction) was displayed. For motor reproduction, as in
Experiment 1, participants held down the spacebar to
reproduce the stimulus duration. For auditory reproduction,
participants clicked the mouse (at which point the mouse
image disappeared) to initiate a tone and clicked again to
terminate it when they felt that tone had been played for the
same length as the stimulus duration. The experiment lasted
for about 25 min.

Experiment 2
Methods
Participants. 20 volunteers (10 females, 20.8 ±2.5 in age)
took part in the experiment.
Design. This experiment was similar to Experiment 1
except that we replaced the comparison task in Experiment 1
with an auditory reproduction task (and we manipulated
reproduction task within-participants). As in Experiment 1,
there were two duration ranges (short range: 600 – 2200 in
steps of 200 ms; long range: 1800 – 3400 in steps of 200 ms).
Two experimental versions were created such that one
version had the short range paired with motor reproduction
and the long range with auditory reproduction and the other
version had the reverse. As in Experiment 1, we were
interested whether people would be susceptible to the
reproduction range bias when reproducing the overlapping
durations (i.e. 1800, 2000 and 2200 ms) under different
reproduction contexts.

Results and discussion
About 6% (216 reproductions) of the data were excluded
as outliers (the high exclusion rate was due to the fact that
participants sometimes accidentally pressed rather than held
down the spacebar due to the influence of the auditory
reproduction method). For the overlapping durations, an
ANOVA using reproduction context and stimulus duration as
within-participant variables reveals a significant main effect
of reproduction context (F(1,19) = 27.73, p < .001, η2 = .59),
with longer reproductions of the overlapping stimulus
durations in the long compared to the short reproduction
context. Reproductions also increased as a function of
stimulus duration (F(1,19) = 131.5, p < .001, η2 = .87). There
was no significant interaction between reproduction context
and stimulus duration (F(1,19) = 0.13, p = .724, η2 = .01).

The results thus replicated, with a within-participant
design, the finding in Experiment 1 that reproduction
experience calibrates duration reproductions. That is, a
duration was reproduced as longer if it was done in the
context of long reproductions compared to short
reproductions. They also suggest that people construct taskspecific priors (i.e. past motor vs. auditory reproduction
experience in the current experiment) in their time estimation,
an issue that awaits further empirical verification.
In Experiment 3, we further explore whether manipulating
the perception context alone leads to a range bias. If
reproduction experience, but not perception experience,
calibrates reproduction, we should not see a range bias in this
experiment.

three blocks, a compulsory 2-min break was inserted after the
first three blocks; additionally, a practice block of 12 trials
preceded the 4th block.
Procedure. The experimental setting and the trial structure
were identical to those in Experiment 1; that is, after the
presentation of a stimulus duration, depending on the ensuing
cue, participants either reproduced the stimulus duration or
compared it with an upcoming duration. During the 2-min
break, participants were allowed to do whatever they liked as
long as they remained seated in the test cubicle. The
experiment took about 25 min.

Participants. 20 volunteers (14 females, 20.0 ±1.2 in age)
took part in Experiment 3.
Design. We manipulated perception context (short vs.
long) within-participants in a blocked design. As in
Experiment 1, Experiment 3 used an alternative-task
paradigm (reproduction or comparison). The two perception
contexts were created using three ranges of durations: the
short perception context consisted of 6 short durations (600 –
1600 in steps of 200 ms) serving as comparison durations and
6 mid durations (1200 – 2200 in steps of 200 ms) serving as
reproduction durations; the long perception context consisted
of the 6 mid durations serving as reproduction durations and
6 long durations (1800 – 2800 in steps of 200 ms) serving as
comparison durations. Thus, the two perception contexts had
the same range of durations to be reproduced (i.e. both had
the mid durations for reproduction) but differed in the range
of durations to be perceived (long and mid durations for the
long perception context but short and mid durations for the
short perception context). If the perception context
manipulation leads to a range bias, we should expect the mid
durations to be reproduced as longer in the long than in the
short perception context. Alternatively, if the range bias is
driven by reproduction experience only, we should expect the
mid durations to be reproduced as equally long between the
two perception contexts.
Materials. As in Experiment 1, a shorter (0.1 log shorter)
and longer (0.1 log longer) comparison duration were created
for each of the comparison durations. Three blocks of
materials were created for both the short and the long
perception context. In each block, each stimulus duration was
presented twice for reproduction and twice for comparison
(once with a longer comparison duration and once with a
shorter comparison duration), amounting to 24 trials in each
block. Two experimental versions were created: the three
blocks of the short perception context preceded those of the
long perception context in one version and the order was
reversed in the other. A short practice block of 4 trials
preceded the first block. In order to prevent possible spillover
of the perception context in the first three blocks to the last

Results and discussion
The trimming criterion led to the exclusion of 5% (80 data
points) of all the reproduced durations. An ANOVA with
perception context as a within-participant factor and
reproduction durations (1200 – 2200) as a within-participant
continuous variable revealed no significant main effect of
perception context (F(1,19) = 0.82, p = .377, η2 = .04),
suggesting that the reproductions of stimulus durations were
similar between the two perception contexts. Reproduction
increased as a function of the stimulus duration (F(1,19) =
255.3, p < .001, η2 = .93). There was no significant interaction
(F(1,19) = 1.18, p = 290, η2 = .06).
The failure for the perception context manipulation to
induce a range bias suggests that participants did not use their
perception experience to infer stimulus duration for their
reproductions. In Experiment 4, we changed all the
comparison trials in Experiment 3 into reproduction trials so
that the long and short perception context had respectively a
long and short reproduction range (i.e. we additionally
introduced the reproduction context manipulation). If people
use reproduction experience to calibrate their time
estimation, we should restore the range bias that was missing
in Experiment 3.

perception experience, drives the range bias.

Experiment 4
Methods

Prior updating

Participants. Another 20 volunteers (14 females, 19.9±1.1
in age) took part in the experiment.
Design, materials and procedure. These were the same
as those in Experiment 3 except that the comparison trials in
Experiment 3 were changed into reproduction trials. Thus,
the short perception context had 6 short durations (600 – 1600
in steps of 200 ms) and 6 mid durations (1200 – 2200 in steps
of 200 ms), all to be reproduced; the long perception context
had 6 mid durations (1200 – 2200 in steps of 200 ms) and 6
long durations (1800 – 2800 in steps of 200 ms), all to be
reproduced.

A crucial prediction of Bayesian inference in time
perception is that the prior is constantly updated. If the prior
in time reproduction is based on previously reproduced rather
than perceived durations, as our experiments have shown, we
should predict the most recently reproduced (but not
perceived) duration to have an influence on the prior, and
hence on the posterior, such that a longer reproduced (but not
perceived) duration in the preceding trial leads to a longer
reproduced duration in the current trial.
The comparison trials in Experiments 1 and 3 allowed us
to examine the possible influence of the preceding perceived
(i.e. stimulus) duration on the prior belief (and the reproduced
duration in the current trial). We used linear mixed effects
modelling for these analyses, where we included as predictors
the stimulus duration of the current trial and the stimulus
duration in the preceding trial. For Experiment 1, though
reproductions increased as a function of the current trial’s
stimulus duration (β = 556.28, SE = 35.56, t(31.0) = 15.65, p <
.001 ), they were insensitive to the magnitude of the stimulus
(i.e. perceived) duration in the preceding comparison trial (β
= -1.75, SE = 17.64, t(28.1) = -0.10, p = .922). The same pattern
was also observed in Experiment 3 (β = 241.36, SE = 16.73,
t(19.4) = 14.43, p < .001, for current stimulus duration; β = 36.90, SE = 26.35, t(19.1) = -1.40, p = .177, for preceding
stimulus duration).
We next analyzed reproductions taking into account the
preceding reproduced duration (i.e. when the preceding trial
was a reproduction trial) in all the 4 experiments.
Reproductions always increased as a function of the stimulus
duration of the current trial (β = 570.52, SE = 23.86, t(31.1) =
23.91, p < .001; β = 643,41, SE = 45.47, t(19.0) = 14.15, p <
.001; β = 225.05, SE = 20.50, t(17.6) = 10.98, p < .001; : β =
413.54, SE = 22.89, t(19.0) = 18.07, p < .001; for Experiments
1-4 respectively) and also of the preceding trial (β = 191.46,
SE = 16.99, t(38.2) = 11.27, p < .001; β = 89.34, SE = 16.64,
t(18.4) = 5.37, p < .001; β = 151.48, SE = 19.95, t(20.6) = 7.59, p
< .001; β = 125.94, SE = 15.96, t(17.7) = 7.89, p < .001; for
Experiments 1-4 respectively). These findings consistently
suggest that the prior was updated by a recent reproduction
output such that a recent longer reproduction increased the
prior mean, which in turn increased the posterior mean,
resulting in a longer reproduction in the current trial.

Results and discussion
We excluded 3% (106 data points) of all the reproduced
durations as outliers. We compared the reproductions of the
6 overlapping stimulus durations (1200 – 2200 in steps of 200
ms) between the two perception (and indeed reproduction)
contexts. In contrast to the finding in Experiment 3, the
ANOVA showed a significant main effect of
perception/reproduction context (F(1,19) = 10.00, p = .005, η2
= .34), with longer reproductions of the stimulus durations
when they were part of the long than the short
perception/reproduction context. Reproductions increased as
a function of the stimulus duration (F(1,19) = 255.6, p < .001,
η2 = .93). The two variables did not interact significantly
(F(1,19) = 0.44, p = .514, η2 = .02), suggesting a central
tendency in the reproduced durations in both contexts.
The most striking observation is the return of the
range bias for the overlapping stimulus durations when
different reproduction ranges were introduced, in contrast to
Experiment 3, where the reproduction range was the same
between the two perception contexts. Such a finding clearly

General discussion
In four experiments, we showed that people use their past
(in particular the most recent) reproduction experience to
calibrate their duration reproduction. These results are
inconsistent with previous Bayesian inference accounts of
timing (and magnitude estimation in general), whereby
people use previously perceived durations to calibrate their
noisy memory of stimulus duration, which in turn is used to
guide reproduction (Jazayeri & Shadlen, 2010; Di Luca &
Rhodes, 2016; Cicchini et al., 2015; Petzschner et al., 2015).

196

Such a memory-optimizing account is explicitly spelled out
in Petzschner et al. (2015) as a Bayesian inference account of
magnitude estimation in general. In this account, people
perceive a magnitude (e.g., a duration) and keep a noisy
memory of it. Later they use their prior belief to infer an
optimal estimate based on this noisy memory, and this
estimate represents the inferred stimulus duration that is used
to guide subsequent response (e.g., time reproduction).
Instead, the current findings support a task-oriented
Bayesian inference account, where people directly use the
noisy memory of the stimulus duration and their past
reproduction experience to infer a reproduction estimate.
Note that, unlike previous accounts, such an estimate is not
an updated version of the stimulus duration but should instead
be viewed as a planned reproduced duration.
If it is the case that Bayesian inference is task-oriented (i.e.
the inference serves the task at hand), then we should expect
the source of the prior information to vary across different
magnitude tasks. For instance, it is possible that, whereas
time reproduction recruits prior reproduction experience,
time comparison may instead recruits prior perception
experience as the task would involve making inferences
about perceived durations. It is also possible, as Experiment
2 suggested, that different reproduction tasks may resort to
task-specific priors. These remain to be tested in future
studies.
