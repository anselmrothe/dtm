FoRs in Dorsal Settings
Research on the relative FoR has focused nearly exclusively
on how people describe relations of objects that are laid out
in front of an observer—for obvious reasons the most
natural situation—although adopting someone’s perspective
already includes the distinction between what is in front of
and what is behind that person. But how, if at all, would
objects laid out behind that person be referred to?
   One hypothesis put forward by Grabowski and Miller
                                                                             oriented G
(2000) is that people refrain from referring to objects in
their back. Rather, they turn around toward the objects,
thereby converting the dorsal into a frontal setting, and then
employ the FoR they prefer for frontal settings. However,
the first studies on dorsal references (Beller et al., 2015,
2016) provided only weak evidence for this turn hypothesis.
