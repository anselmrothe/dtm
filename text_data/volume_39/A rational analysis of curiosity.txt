were designed to measure curiosity about semantic knowl-
edge and evoke a range of curiosity levels.
Procedure
The experiment was divided into two phases – the main round
and bonus round. The main round was used to elicit and
measure curiosity in participants. Participants were shown 40
trivia questions one after another and were asked to rate their
confidence (i.e., probability that they know the correct an-
swer) and curiosity in knowing the correct answer. Curiosity
ratings were on a scale from 1 to 7 and the confidence scale
ranged from 0 to 100%. Following Kang et al.’s methodol-
                                                                      Figure 4: Relationship of curiosity and confidence in the main

   At the beginning of the experiment, participants were ran-
domly assigned to two conditions – the confidence and the
uniform condition. Both the conditions had the same main
round as described above but used different sampling meth-
ods for the bonus round. In the confidence condition, the sam-
pling in bonus round was done based on the confidence rat-
ings provided by the participants i.e. the questions for which
participant’s confidence rating was higher were more likely to
appear in the second part of the bonus round. In the uniform
condition, this sampling procedure was completely random
i.e. each question was equally likely to appear in second part
of the bonus round. Critically, participants were informed
about the sampling procedure for their respective condition
before the beginning of the bonus round. In a sense, the con-
fidence condition creates a situation in which confidence is
related to need probability (Graph 1 in Figure 1) and the uni-
form condition breaks this relationship (Graph 2 in Figure 1).
