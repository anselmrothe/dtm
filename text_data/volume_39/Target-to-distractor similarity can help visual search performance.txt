representations of each character. That is, a character seen
less often has a weaker chunk representation and is more
likely to be encoded as a configuration of some of its features
rather than as a single higher-level unit. Thus, when a
participant is searching for a LF character the probability of
partially matching some of the target’s features with features
of the distractors is much greater compared to HF characters.
This leads to more false alarms in the absent condition, but
does not affect the present condition. The interaction was
also evident in RTs, although there was still a small effect of
frequency in the present trials, likely reflecting the
differential efficiency of encoding high and low frequency
characters.
   A number of previous versions of this experiment had
failed to show the hypothesized frequency effects. In those
experiments, the distractors in each search array were chosen
at random and thus were not very similar to the targets on
each trial. In contrast, in the current experiment we ensured
that targets were paired with highly similar distractors. We

expected the two hidden layers to progressively extract
higher order features of the input. Initial weights between
these layers were randomized with a mean of 0 and sd of 0.5.
Each unit of the hidden2 layer was connected with the
corresponding unit in the input layer of the LSTM module, as
well as with the direct_output layer with a frozen weight of
1. The same applied to the connections from LSTM_Input to
LSTM_Buffer and from LSTM_Buffer to LSTM_Output.
Thus, the output of the hidden2 layer was copied forward to
the output layer of the LSTM module, and to the
direct_output layer. The LSTM module also had a recurrent
context layer that was connected bi-directionally to the
LSTM_Buffer layer.
   The purpose of the four gates was to control the flow of
activation through these two modules. There was a fixed
negative bias of -1 to the LSTM_input and LSTM_output
layers, and a fixed positive connection of 1 with their
corresponding gates. Since they were all linear units that were
cropped at 0 and 1, when a gate was off, no activity was
copied to corresponding and subsequent layers. When a gate
was on, it negated the bias and the layer copied the output of
the preceding layer and passed it forward.
Network functioning
   Each example trial was composed of four events (i.e.,
presenting different input patterns):
     1. Presentation of the target
     2. First candidate from the search array
     3. Second candidate from the search array
     4. Final candidate from the search array
   When the target was presented to the input, only the
LSTM_input gate was on. Thus, the activity in hidden2 layer
