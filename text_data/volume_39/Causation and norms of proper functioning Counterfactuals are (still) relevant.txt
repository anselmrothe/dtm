Results
We excluded participants who did not answer all three of the
check questions correctly, and analyzed the remaining 258
participants’ judgments. To facilitate comparison of partic-
ipants’ judgments, we computed a measure of participants’
preference for selecting the norm-violating event as a cause.
Participants who selected only the norm-violating event as a
cause were assigned a score of 1; participants who selected
both or neither events as causes were assigned score of 0; and
participants who selected only the norm-conforming event
were assigned a score of -1. We then analyzed participants’
causal preference scores with a 2 (Causal Question: Agent
vs. Object) × 3 (Norm condition: Immoral vs. Malfunc-
tion vs. Normal) proportional odds logistic regression, as in
Study 1. This analysis revealed a main effect of Norm con-
dition, (LRT = 71.49 [d f = 2], p < .001), no main effect of
Causal question (LRT = 0.045 [d f = 1], p = .832), and crit-
ically a Norm condition × Causal question interaction effect
(LRT = 31.42 [d f = 2], p < .001).
   We decomposed this interaction effect by separately ana-
lyzing participants’ causal preference scores for each of the
different conditions. When the relevant norm was moral
and thus applied to the agent but not the object, participants
tended to prefer the norm-violating agent as a cause, but
did not similarly prefer the norm-violating object as a cause
(LRT = 15.33 [d f = 1], p < .001). When the relevant norm
was functional, and thus the norm applied to the object but
not the agent, this pattern was reversed: participants tended to
prefer the norm-violating object as a cause, but did not simi-
larly prefer the norm-violating agent as a cause (LRT = 12.36
[d f = 1], p < .001). When there was no norm that applied
to either the agent or the object, there was small and non-
significant preference for the norm-conforming agent but not
the object (LRT = 1.13 [d f = 1], p = .288).

                        Experiment 3
Previous research (Phillips et al., 2015) has demonstrated that
causal judgments are also sensitive to more direct counterfac-
tual manipulations: participants tend to judge an event to be
more causal after they generate relevant alternative ways that
the event could have occurred. In Experiment 3, we extend
this method by asking participants to generate alternatives to
one particular aspect of the causal structure that contributes
to the outcome (i.e., to the agent or to the inanimate object).
We then measure how their causal judgments are affected by
this manipulation. This allows us to test a precise prediction
of a unified counterfactual account: participants causal judg-
ments should be affected by the generation of counterfactual
alternatives primarily for the part of the causal structure that
the counterfactual alternative focused on.
