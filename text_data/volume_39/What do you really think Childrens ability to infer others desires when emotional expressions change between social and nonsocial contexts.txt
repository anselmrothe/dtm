Procedure Children were tested individually; all sessions
were videotaped. Children were asked check questions to
encourage them to follow along. Incorrect responses were
corrected throughout. Children had little difficulty with the
check questions. Check questions were used only to
maintain children’s attention; they were not analyzed or
used as inclusion criteria.
   Each story was read consecutively, as follows (using the
basketball-game story as an example). The experimenter
placed the first picture on the table and said, “There is a
basketball game today. It’s the Tiger team against the Lion
team.” She introduced the next picture and said, “This is
Tom. Tom is a basketball fan. He loves watching basketball
games. He goes to watch the game. He is either a fan of the
Tiger team, or the Lion team, but we don’t know which
one.” Children were asked (Check question 1): “Do we
know which team Tom is a fan of?” The experimenter
introduced the third picture and said, “This is Bryan. Bryan
was Tom’s friend when they were little, but now they don’t
get to see each other very much. Bryan becomes a
basketball player. He plays in the game. He either plays for
the Tiger team or the Lion team, but we don’t know which
one.” Children were asked (Check question 2): “Do we
know which team Bryan plays for?” The experimenter
introduced the fourth picture and said, “The result of the
game was that the Tiger team won, and the Lion team lost.”
Then the experimenter introduced the fifth picture and said,
“After the game, Bryan ran back to the locker room. Tom                    Figure 1 Example of the materials used in
