   This model operates over the possible melodies that the
speaker could use and considers those possibilities when cal-
culating the probability of the projection of the prejacent. To
test the model, we examine the model’s predictions for two
particular melodies and compare those predictions to experi-
mental results. The next section provides information on the
two melodies and how their effect on the projection of the
prejacent was assessed experimentally.
                Experiment methodology
Using the method of Tonhauser 2016, participants listened                  Figure 1: A screenshot of one experimental item.

whether the speaker was certain of the prejacent.
