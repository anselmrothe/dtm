a coordinate plane, identifying the coordinates of each card,
and calculating the Euclidean distance between the
coordinates. The range of possible distances was 1 (adjacent
cards) to 12.73 (cards on diagonally opposite corners of the
board). These distances are taken as a measure of the degree               Figure 2. Change scores for Zoo and Control Camp
