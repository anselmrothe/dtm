                               Abstract
   The distinction between integral and separable dimensions is
   of central importance to understanding how humans integrate
   information from multiple stimulus sources. One approach to
   characterizing stimulus integrality is through a set of speeded
   categorization tasks most closely associated with the work of
   Wendell Garner. These tasks demonstrate that integral dimen-
   sions result in marked speed up or slow down in responding
   when there is correlated or irrelevant variation, respectively,       Figure 1. Garner’s (1974) control, correlated, and filtering

 effect. There are several potential explanations for Garner in-
 terference. For one, there are more items in the filtering task
 than in the control task which may encourage more conser-
 vative responding, especially if the stimuli are highly con-
 fusable. Alternatively, the increase in the number of items
 might increase the perceived variability which would act to
 slow RTs (Nosofsky & Palmeri, 1997).
    In a recent paper using a modified version of the Garner
 task (see Figure 2), Little et al. (2016) showed that one ex-
 planation for filtering interference was the reduction of direct
 sequential repetitions in the filtering condition. That is, with      Figure 2. Schematic diagram of the modified Garner-task
