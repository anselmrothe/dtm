Abstract: Collaborative spatial problem solving is an important yet not thoroughly examined task. Participants navigated
individually and in dyads through virtual cities of varying complexity. They only saw the environment part visible from their
current location from a bird’s eye view map perspective. We recorded missed target locations, overall trajectory length and
search time per person until self-indicating whole coverage. Our results show a general increase in missed locations, trajectory
length, and search time with the complexity of the environment. These increases differed due to individual and collaborative
search. For complex, but not for simple environments individual participants navigated shorter distances, finished earlier, but
also missed more target locations than when searching the same environments in collaboration. These results indicate that in
complex environments collaborative search is less error prone than individual search, but takes longer. Such initial findings will
constrain future theorizing about collaborative spatial problem solving.
