demonstrated that children are more likely to project a
property from one entity to another when the two entities
are similar. For example, Carey (1985) demonstrated that
the strength of inductions increased as premise-conclusion
similarity increased, and sensitivity to this relationship
increased with age. In light of the present findings, these
similarity effects (or 'similarity correlates') in children's
induction appear not to have been fully decomposed. As our
discussion to this point demonstrates, children might be
aware of the salience of common features, distinct features
or both. And it could be that there are qualitative differences
between children and adult reasoning in this respect. One
plausible hypothesis is that children's induction is initially
focused on commonalities, particularly perceptual ones, but
becomes more able to accommodate differences as cognitive
capacity increases.
   Finally, the results also highlight long-term effects of
reasoning. The evaluations that are generated during
inductive reasoning cause conceptual change in the
similarity of the relevant categories, and this change is
relatively long term. Given that induction is an efficient tool
for knowledge acquisition, such changes are not surprising.
