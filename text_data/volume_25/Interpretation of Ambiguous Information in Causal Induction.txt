   The third possibility is that people would assimilate
ambiguous events in light of the most likely causal
hypothesis they hold at that point in time (Assimilation
Hypothesis). Consider the previous example of outside
humidity as a cause of joint pain. Suppose a person is
leaning towards believing that humid days cause her joint
pain. One day when her joint pain was particularly bad, the
weather was neither definitely humid nor definitely dry.
Because she believed high humidity caused her joint pain,
she would interpret the weather that day as being humid.
Conversely, on a day with the same ambiguous humidity
where she did not experience joint pain, she would interpret
that day as dry, despite the exact same weather as in the
previous case. To put it in more general terms, suppose the           Figure 2. Set 1 and Set 2 targets and ambiguous items.

Participants were told that if they believed a test item was
very similar to Target A to give it a number close to 1 and if
they believed a test item was very similar to Target B to
give it a number close to 9. Participants were also
instructed that they could use any number between 1 and 9,
keeping in mind that 5 was the midpoint of the scale. After
reading the instructions for a given item set, a participant
