Free nodes form a pool of nodes from which suitably
connected nodes are recruited for representing new func-

Structured recruitment learning
Learning the relatively complex structures of SHRUTI
poses a significant challenge for the recruitment learn-
ing approach because learning such structures involves
recruiting not just individual cells, but also structured en-
sembles or functional circuits. The probability of extract-
ing a particular structure in a randomly connected struc-
ture quickly approaches zero as the complexity of the
structure increases. Structures in SHRUTI are sufficiently
complex that it would be unreasonable to expect them to
emerge in a random network. Consequently, some level
of pre-existing organization is required. We argue that                  Figure 3: Soccer network after learning.
