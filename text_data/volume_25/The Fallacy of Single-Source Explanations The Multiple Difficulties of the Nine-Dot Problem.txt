familiarize participants with the solution shape of the

Specifically, participants were told that the shape they

participants were shown the correct answer for judging

     In addition to combining elements from the
previous experiments and the literature on the nine-dot
problem, Experiment III compared several new variants
of the nine-dot problem to the original as a further test
of the non-dot turns hypothesis. Much of the nine-dot
literature has shown that variants of the nine-dot
problem (such as problems with additional dots) are              Figure 5: 11-Dot, 10-Dot, Displaced Nine-Dot, and
