this time interval, these consumed food pieces disappeared.
In both conditions, food was gathered when a participant’s
position coincided with a piece of food.
     Every experiment was divided into six 5-minute
sessions. These six games consisted of all combinations of
the two levels of knowledge (Visible versus Invisible) and
the three levels of resource distribution (50/50, 65/35,
80/20). For each of the three distribution conditions, two
resource pools were constructed, with center locations at
reflections and rotations of the set of coordinates {40,15}
and {15, 65}. A different reflection and rotation was used
for each of the six conditions, with the result that the
resource centers were approximately equally likely to be in
each of eight possible locations, and the two centers within
one session always had the same distance from one another.
Two opposite orders of the six games were randomly
assigned to the eight separate groups of participants. Each
order began with a visible condition and then alternated
between visible and invisible conditions.
     The rate of distribution of food was based on the
number of participants, with one piece of food delivered
every 4/N seconds, where N is the number of participants.
This yields an average of one food piece per participant per
four seconds. When a piece of food was delivered, it was
assigned to a pool probabilistically based upon the
distribution rate. For example, in the 80/20 condition, the
food would occur in the more plentiful pool 80% of the
                                                                                                Figure 1

     A fruitful extension to the current work would be the
development of an agent-base computer simulation that
models the large quantity of spatial-temporal population
information amassed in the experiment. Such a model
would need to incorporate a distinction between agents with
and without vision. Blind agents might resemble standard
reinforcement learning devices if supplemented by biases
that undermatch distributions. Incorporating agents with
vision is more challenging, raising important issues in
generating expectations and planning. However, the current
empirical work suggests that developing these more
sophisticated agents with knowledge is worth the trouble.
Knowledge of food distributions allows an agent to more
effectively match those distributions, whereas knowledge of
other agents allows an agent to more effectively decouple
their responses from others.
