the relationship between Jenny and Mark. These questions

were 1 to 2 Belief questions such as, “In general, when
people identify someone whom they've seen once or twice

   After completing this questionnaire (pretest), participants
were then administered the distracter task, consisting of 20
verbal analogies from the Miller Analogies Test on a new
web page. This task was then followed by the second
questionnaire (post test) on another new web page.
   The post test consisted of a large legal case about a
suspect in the murder of a security guard at a company. The
defendant was an employee named Tim O’Reilly. This case
incorporated the same factual elements conveyed separately
in the pretest vignettes.
   After reading the case, participants came to a verdict          Figure 2: Agreement with Guilt Score - Facts by individuals
