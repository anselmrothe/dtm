audience design as a co-operative process, because it
often requires the speaker to ‘decentre’, or take a
perspective other than their own (Piaget, 1926).
  A very robust finding in the literature is that, during
referential communication tasks, speakers’ descriptions
tend to get shorter and more efficient with repeated
mention (e.g. Clark & Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Krauss &
Weinheimer, 1964). However, speakers overcome this
tendency towards increased efficiency, and go back to
using longer, more elaborate references when they start
talking to a new addressee (Brennan & Clark, 1996;
Wilkes-Gibbs & Clark, 1992). This suggests that speakers
are sensitive to how easily their partner will be able to
