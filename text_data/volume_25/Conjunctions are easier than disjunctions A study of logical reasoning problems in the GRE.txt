    In accordance with the theory of mental models, when
individuals reason about problems derived from those in
the GRE, they cope better with those based on
conditionals than with those based on disjunctions.
Experiment 1 yielded only a difference in latency, which
was just reliable. But the difference reflected only a single
sentence in the text, which was either conditional or
disjunction. Experiment 2 yielded robust effects in
accuracy and latency when the difference concerned both
a sentence in the text and the two response options: the
three sentences were either all conditionals or all
disjunctions. Experiment 3 showed that these effects
were primarily a result of manipulating the response
options. This phenomenon makes sense: reasoners have to
keep considering the response options throughout the
process of trying to solve the problems. And the correct
response hinges on the complete text, not just the single
sentence that we manipulated in the text of the problems.
The model theory is able to elucidate certain aspects of
performance with reasoning problems in the GRE. As it
predicts, reasoning from conditionals is easier than
reasoning from logically equivalent disjunctions.
