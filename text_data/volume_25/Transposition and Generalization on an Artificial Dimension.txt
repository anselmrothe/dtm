stimulus with its outcome via the delta rule, and this in

even though we know that the training had a significant
effect on performance. Instead, the generalization model
can account for both the gradient established across the
dimension and the differential effect of the trained dis-
criminations on this gradient.
General Discussion and Conclusion
 The purpose of this paper was to test the generalization
model of discrimination learning developed by Suret and
