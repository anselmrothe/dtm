be difficult to handle, since remote extensions of the schema
might always be possible. We note, however, that our
results show reversals in performance (especially for denial
of the antecedent arguments) that are unexplained on the
hypothesis that any relation to containers boosts
performance.
Conclusion
The current study cannot rule out the possibility that the
Container Schema is sometimes helpful to people when they
reason about conditionals. The findings do suggest,
however, that Container Schemas are not the only source of
content effects. The theory of Container Schemas suggests
no reason for an advantage of abstract container-related
content over literal container-related content and no reason
why such effects should appear with some argument types
but not others.
