Abstract
An experiment with a multiple-cue judgment task tested
the hypothesis that humans can only abstract explicit representations of cue-criterion relations when the cues are
related to the criterion by an additive function. It is proposed that the sequential and capacity-constrained nature
of controlled, explicit thought can only induce and execute linear additive cue integration; non-additive environments require exemplar memory. The results showed
that an additive task induced processes of cue abstraction
and cue integration, while a multiplicative task induced
exemplar processes. The results suggest flexible interplay
between distinct representation-levels, a preference to
abstract explicit ‚Äúrules‚Äù whenever possible, although this
capacity is constrained to additive cue-criterion relations.

Introduction
In this article we make three general claims about the
cognitive processes involved in multiple-cue judgment:
a) the cognitive system has multiple qualitatively distinct representations that ‚Äúrace‚Äù to control the judgments in a specific task (e.g., Ashby, Alfonso-Reese,
Turken, & Waldron, 1998; Erickson & Kruschke, 1998;
Juslin, H. Olsson, & A-C. Olsson, 2003); b) humans
prefer to abstract explicit ‚Äúrule-based‚Äù knowledge when
the task feedback and the task structure allows for it
(see also Ashby et al., 1998; Juslin et al., 2003); and c)
because the sequential and capacity-constrained nature
of explicit thought processes only allows induction and
execution of additive cue integration, human‚Äôs are only
capable of abstracting explicit cue-criterion representations when cues are related to the criterion by an additive function. These claims‚Äîand the last one, in particular‚Äîare tested in an experiment that relies on a task
that allows us to identify whether cue abstraction has
been successfully achieved (Juslin et al., 2003).
Linear, additive models often fit judgment data well
in research on multiple-cue judgment (Brehmer, 1988;
Cooksey, 1996). The issue of whether humans integrate
information in an additive manner is, however, a core
topic also in other fields of psychology, such as developmental psychology and perception. A main claim by
Andersson¬¥s (1981) Information Integration Theory is
that humans integrate information with an additive rule.
634

It is likewise suggested that perception of depth is enabled by adding the cues (Bruno & Cutting,1988).
We propose that the results from multiple-cue judgment reflect a general architectural property of the
controlled and explicit thought processes of the human
mind. The idea is that the sequential, real-time consideration of multiple cues is a process of successive adjustment of the judgment, a process structurally compatible with a linear, additive cue-integration rule (Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz, 1979). This hypothesis suggests that explicit and controlled thought processes are particularly apt at performing cue-integration
in tasks where the cue-criterion relations are additive.
By contrast, a task that involves non-linear or multiplicative cue-criterion relations requires the capitalization
on some more implicit process, such as exemplar memory (Medin & Schaffer, 1978; Nosofsky & Johansen,
2000). Exemplar memory makes no computational
commitments to a particular task structure (linear or
otherwise).
In this study, we test this hypothesis in the context of
two additional assumptions. First, because abstract and
explicit knowledge is more general, useable in a more
flexible and controlled manner, and more easily verbalized and communicated to others, as soon as the environment and task feedback allows for it humans have a
preference to abstract explicit knowledge (Ashby et al.,
1998; Juslin et al, 2003). Second: when people are
unable to abstract explicit cue-criterion relations they
retreat to exemplar memory (Juslin et al, 2003). Therefore, we predict that we can induce a shift between
qualitatively distinct cognitive processes by manipulating the deep-lying structural properties of the task environment: additive cue-criterion relations should promote explicit cue abstraction and multiplicative cuecriterion relations should promote exemplar memory.

Judgment Task and Cognitive Models
The task requires participants to use four binary cues to
infer a continuous criterion. (Juslin et al., 2003). The
judgments involve the toxicity of subspecies of a fictitious bug. The different subspecies vary in concentration of poison from 50 ppm (harmless) to 60 ppm (le-

thal). The toxicity can be inferred from four binary
visual cues (C1, C2, C3, and C4) of the subspecies (e.g.,
the length of their legs, color of their back, the length of
their nose and spots or no spots on the foreback). The
cue structure is shown in Table 1. There are two conditions, one additive and one multiplicative.

When presented with a probe the participants retrieve
rules connecting cues to the criterion from memory
(e.g., ‚ÄúGreen back goes with being poisonous‚Äù). The
rules specify the sign of the relation and the importance
of each cue with a cue weight. For example, after training the rule for cue C1 may specify that C1=1 goes with
a large increase in the toxicity of a subspecies.
Cue abstraction with additive cue integration implies
that the participants compute an estimate of the continuous criterion c. For each cue, the appropriate rule is
retrieved and the estimate of c is adjusted according to
the cue weight Z iA (i=1‚Ä¶4). The final estimate cÃÇCA of
c is a linear additive function of the cue values Ci,

model produce perfect judgments. The intercept k constrains the function relating judgments to criteria to be
regressive around the midpoint (55) of the interval [50,
60] specified by the task instructions.
As outlined in the introduction, our hypothesis is that
explicit cue abstraction is essentially constrained to the
linear additive form in Eq. 3. However, when the models are fitted to data below, we also consider the possibility that the participants have correctly abstracted the
multiplicative cue-criterion relations by fitting a multiplicative cue-abstraction model to the data:

The exemplar model implies that the participants
make judgments by retrieving similar exemplars (subspecies) from long-term memory. When the exemplar
model is applied to judgments of a continuous criterion
variable, the estimate cÃÇ E of the criterion c is a weighted
average of the criteria cj stored for the J exemplars,
where the similarities S(p,xj) are the weights:

In the additive condition the toxicity c of a subspecies
is a linear, additive function of the cue values:
(1)
c 50  4 ¬ò C1  3 ¬ò C 2  2 ¬ò C 3  1 ¬ò C 4
C1 is the most important cue with coefficient 4 (i.e., a
relative weight .4), C2 is the second to most important
with coefficient 3, and so forth. A subspecies with feature vector (0, 0, 0, 0) thus has poison concentration 50
ppm; a subspecies with feature vector (1, 1, 1, 1) has 60
ppm. In the multiplicative condition the toxicity c of a
subspecies is a multiplicative function of the four cue
values (the criterion values are shown in Table 1):
(2)
c 51  0.0009875 ¬ò eC1 ¬ò 4  C 2 ¬ò3 C3 ¬ò2  C 4 ¬ò1
with the same coefficients as in the additive task (Eq.
1). The additive and multiplicative task environments
are construed to produce equal training ranges for the
two conditions (all training exemplars have a toxicity
between 51 and 59). Moreover, the criteria in the multiplicative condition are a simple exponential function of
the criteria presented in the additive condition. In both
the additive and the multiplicative condition a random
error is added to the criterion values, implying a probabilistic relation between cues and criteria (Re=.9).
We use two models to derive predictions for the two
conditions, a cue-abstraction and an exemplar model.
The cue-abstraction model assumes that the participants abstract explicit cue-criterion relations in training,
which are mentally integrated at the time of judgment.

are four parameters in the interval [0, 1] that capture the
impact of deviating cues values (features) on the overall
perceived similarity S(p,xj). A value of si close to 1
implies that a deviating feature on this cue dimension
has no impact on the perceived similarity and is considered irrelevant. A value of si close to 0 means that the
similarity S(p,xj) is close to 0 if this feature is deviating,
thus assigning crucial importance to the feature. For
low si, only identical exemplars have a profound effect
on the judgments; with si close to 1 all exemplars receive the same weight, regardless of their features.
In the experiment five of the subspecies in the test
phase are not included in the training phase (Exemplars
1, 5, 6, 7, & 16 in Table 1). This makes it possible to
distinguish between the models as they provide different predictions (see Figure 1). In the training phase, all
exemplars have toxicity between 51 and 59. If the participants have estimated the correct cue weight for each
cue there should be no problem to compute the most
extreme judgments for the extreme exemplars that are
left out in the training phase (i.e., Exemplars 1 & 16).
More specifically, whenever the participants have correctly identified the sign of the impact of each cue (i.e.,
whether it increases or decreases toxicity) they should
always make the most extreme judgments for Exemplars 1 (all cues present) and 16 (all cues absent), as
illustrated on the left-side of Figure 1. (This holds both
for the additive and the multiplicative cue-abstraction
models). By contrast, the exemplar model computes a
weighted average of the stored exemplars with toxicity
between 51 and 59 and this can never produce a value
outside of the observed range (DeLosh et al., 1997;
Erickson & Krusckhe, 1998). Moreover, because of the
multiplicative similarity rule in Eq. 6, the most extreme
judgments are made for the second to most extreme
exemplars (Exemplars 2 & 15). For these exemplars the
judgment is dominated by retrieval of identical stored
exemplars and these identical exemplars are the most
extreme that have been encountered in training. These
predictions are illustrated on the right side of Figure 1.
When the new exemplars in the mid range of toxicity
(Exemplars 5, 6, & 7) are judged, cue abstraction suggests no systematic difference between these three new
exemplars and three old exemplars matched in toxicity
(Exemplars 4, 9, & 10): the cognitive process is the
same regardless of whether a specific exemplar has
been encountered before or not. The exemplar model,
however, predicts more precise judgments for the old
exemplars because for these exemplars the participants
can benefit from previous identical exemplars with the
correct criterion c. In addition, with most similarity
parameters si these new exemplars have a high overall
similarity to exemplars with a lower criterion than the
correct value. Therefore, in general the exemplar model
will predict that the new exemplars are underestimated.

The Experiment
In the experiment we manipulated whether participants
were confronted with a task that involved additive or
multiplicative cue-criterion relations. For reasons outlined in the introduction, we predicted that the additive
task (Eq. 1) should promote explicit cue abstraction
with additive cue integration (Eq. 3). A multiplicative
task (Eq. 2) should cause a shift to a qualitatively different process, that is, to exemplar memory (Eq. 5).
We also examined an alternative way to induce shifts
between cognitive processes. Because working memory
is more involved in the integration of explicitly ab1

The optimal parameters are multiplied by 0.8 to yield functions that are more descriptive of the noise in data.

illustrated in Figure 1 the similarity parameters si have been

stracted cues, we hypothesized that a distracter of the
working memory in the test phase should affect cue
abstraction more than exemplar processes. Therefore,
introduction of a working memory distraction task
should promote a shift towards more exemplar processes, in particular, in the additive task where cue abstraction is expected.

Method
Participants
Eighty undergraduate students volunteered, receiving a
payment of 60-99 SKr, depending on their performance. Thirty-nine participants were men and 41 were
women. They were all between 20 and 37 years old.

Materials and Procedure
The participant judged the toxicity of the subspecies in
a training phase, followed by two test phases. The subspecies were presented to the participant on a computer
screen as visual pictures, one at a time, and the participant controlled the time of exposure. The subspecies
varied in terms of four binary cues; short, blue or long,
green legs; short, darkblue or long, grey nose; spots or
no spots on the fore back; and brown or geen buttock.
In the training phase, 11 different subspecies were
shown 20 times each, requiring a total of 220 judgments. Subspecies nr 1, 5, 6, 7 and 16 were left out, as
imposed by the task design (see Table 1). The subspecies were shown in random order for every participant.
The cue weights were also randomized, so that what
was the most important cue differed across participants.
With each subspecies, a question in written text on the
screen was to be answered, asking for ‚Äúhow poisonous
is this subspecies?‚Äù In the training phase, feedback was
given on the correct criterion after each judgment
(‚ÄúThis subspecies has toxicity 57 ppm‚Äù).
There were two test phases. One had an additional
working memory distracter task. This task was to listen
to a recorded voice reading Swedish words at a rate of
1 s., and simultaneously perform the judgments, while
remembering the number of words heard that denotes
something alive (for example the word ‚Äúdog‚Äù). It was
outbalanced so that half of the participants had the
undistracted test phase first and the distracted test phase
last, and vice versa. Each test phase consisted of 16
different subspecies. The subspecies were shown two
times each, requiring a total of 32 judgments for one
test phase. Subspecies nr 1, 5, 6, 7 and 16 were introduced, as imposed by the task design. In the test phases,
no feedback was given on the correct criterion.

Dependent Measures
The measure of performance is Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of the judgments (i.e., between judgments and criteria). Measures of model fit are the coefficient of determination (r2) and Root Mean Square

637

Deviation (RMSD) between predictions and data computed on the basis of the data from the test phase. The
exemplar index, ¬®E, is a measure of to what extent the
judgments are dominated by an exemplar-based process. ¬®E is the sum of two measures; old-new difference
and extrapolation. The old-new difference is computed
as the difference between the absolute deviation between judgments and criteria for the old exemplars and
the absolute deviation between judgments and criteria
for the matched new exemplars (denoted ‚ÄúO‚Äù and ‚ÄúE‚Äù
in Table 1). Extrapolation is computed as the absolute
deviation from the judgment predicted by linear regression of the judgments for training exemplars on the
criterion. When this measure equals zero, the participants extrapolate appropriately for the extreme exemplars. The old-new difference and the extrapolation
measure will be added for every participant, yielding a
single measure of exemplar effects, the exemplar index
¬®E:
(7)
'E ¬¶ 'ON  Extrap.
T

A negative ¬®E is predicted when the participant makes
systematically poorer judgments for new exemplars
compared with old exemplars. A cue-abstraction model
predicts no systematic differences between judgments
on old and new exemplars (see Juslin et al, 2003, for a
further discussion of the ¬®E measure).

Results
A two-way ANOVA with environment (additive or
multiplicative) as between-subject factor and the two
test phases (undistracted and distracted) as withinsubject factor, shows two main effects on RMSE (Table
2).
First, there is significantly better performance (lower
RMSE) for the additive condition (F(1.78)=160.69;
MSE=2.032; p=0.000). Second, there is a significant
effect on performance of the working memory distracter. The RMSE is better in the undistracted test phase
(F(1.78)=5.9112; MSE=0.5982; p=0.017).

multiplicative condition, suggesting more reliance on
exemplar-memory (F(1,782) = 43,12; MSE = 33,74;

p<0,0025, Figure 2) suggests that the effect of a working memory distracter was different in the two conditions; in the Additive condition less strong reliance on
cue abstraction was induced, while in the multiplicative
condition less strong reliance on exemplar memory was
the result.

Although significant, because the difference between
the two test-phases was small and difficult to discern
from visual inspection of data, and the aim of this paper
is to investigate how the learning task affects cognitive
processes, the mean judgments in the additive and
multiplicative conditions were collapsed over the two
test phases. The mean judgments are shown in Figure 3.
In the additive condition, the judgments are a linear
function of the criterion. Although there is some noise,
there are no visible extra- or interpolation effects. In the
multiplicative condition, the judgments do not follow
the optimal line, nor the best fitting regression line.
Although the judgments are a positive function of the
criteria in the training range (51-59), the inability to
extrapolate is striking. Notably, the judgments for c=72
is significantly lower than for c=59. In sum, these results show no signs of exemplar-processes in the additive condition, but clear signs of exemplar processes in
the multiplicative condition.
Model fits were obtained by fitting the models described in the introduction with Mean Square Error
between predictions and data as the error function. The
models were further applied through a method of projective fit (Juslin et al., 2003). The models were thus
fitted to data from the latter half of the training phase
(i.e., based on 11 subspecies) and then applied with the
parameters fitted to this data set to the data with all 16
subspecies in the test phase. This implies cross-

As predicted in the additive task condition the additive cue-abstraction model fits data better than the exemplar model, while the reverse is very clearly true in
the multiplicative condition. In the multiplicative condition the multiplicative cue-abstraction model performs
somewhat better than the additive cue abstraction
model. This is probably an effect of its higher correlation with the predictions by the exemplar model. Figure

3 provides no evidence for cue abstraction in the multiplicative condition. There were no clear differences
between the test phase with and without working memory distraction in regard to the model fits and the same
pattern as in Table 3 was observed in both conditions.

Discussion
The broad claim that essentially humans are only capable of extracting explicit cue-criterion relations from
training with outcome feedback when they are related
by an additive function is supported by the experiment.
The cue-abstraction model provided both a qualitatively and quantitatively better explanation of the data
in the Additive condition, while the exemplar model is
a better explanation in the Multiplicative condition.
That the exemplar-based model produces a relatively
good fit to data in the additive condition as well could
be interpreted in terms of quasi-rationality (e.g. Brehmer, 1994; Cooksey, 1996; Hammond, 1996; Juslin et
al, 2003); the additive task might have induced exemplar-memory for some participants.
What might be seen as a clear and simple mathemathical manipulation of the task structure is sufficient
to induce qualitatively different cognitive processes.
These results suggests that: a) By manipulating the cuecriterion relations one can induce shifts between cognitive processes; b) the shift arises when the preference
for explicit representations (i.e. abstract knowledge of
cue-criterion relations) can not be met because of cognitive limitations, and people turn to the back-up process of exemplar memory; and c) the reason for this
cognitive limitation is an architectural constraint on
explicit and controlled thought processes only allowing
for abstraction and integration in a sequential, additive
manner. The results in regard to the manipulation of
working memory load were less clear. Both visual inspection of data and the model fits indicate little difference between the conditions. The performance suggests
that working memory distraction affected performance
in a negative manner, but with no clear signs of a representational shift (i.e., the significant interaction is difficult to interpret).
It may be objected that the stimuli vary in few dimensions which may have promoted exemplar memory
(see Smith & Minda, 2000, for a discussion). However,
it remains the fact that qualitatively and quantitatively
different results were obtained over the two conditions,
with the same stimuli. The criteria in the multiplicative
condition are concentrated around the low fifties. This
could possibly have imposed a simple learning rule like
‚ÄúI always guess on 51‚Äù. However, the results show a
significantly positive regression-line suggesting that the
participants have learned the positive relation, yet both
the inability to extrapolate and the model fits suggest
that the knowledge is in form of exemplars. If some
kind of additive rule was used the judgments on the
extreme exemplar #1 (c=72) would not be expected to
be lower than the judgments on exemplar #2 (c=59).

The aspects proposed in this paper needs to be further addressed. A comparision between how the cueabstraction model and exemplar-models augmented
with linear extra-polation (for example EXAM, DeLosh
et al, 1997) describe data would be particularly valuable. Taken together, the results in the paper suggest
that the type of cue-criterion relations has a powerful
effect on cognitive processes.
