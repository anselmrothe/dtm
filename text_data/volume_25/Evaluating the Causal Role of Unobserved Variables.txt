   Despite the difficulty involving unobserved causes,
people cannot, in general, avoid such situations in everyday
life. For example, you may hear about a car accident, but
not be told about the infinite number of potential causes
(e.g. consumption of alcohol, road conditions, mechanical
problems with the vehicle, mobile phone use, etc.).
Furthermore, even if people were free to make any
observations in a given situation, cognitive limitations
would not allow them to keep track of information about all
possible causes.
   One way of getting around such limitations is to make the

  One might think that Recorla-Wagner could use the context cue
to make predictions about unobserved causes. The context cue is
present on every trial. We have since verified that participants, on
the other hand, do not believe the unobserved cause to be
constantly present. Conversely, one could think of the context cue
as a composite cue that includes context and any unobserved
causes. This remains problematic because it is still unclear
whether any given unobserved cause is present or absent in CE,
C~E, and ~C~E trials, as illustrated in the introduction, and
because it is unclear how to partial out the context cue’s predicted
associative strength to each member of the composite.
