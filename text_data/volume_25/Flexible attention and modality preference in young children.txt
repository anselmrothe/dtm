understanding of the role of attention in processing. First,
attention can be flexibly shifted between auditory and visual
stimuli depending on familiarity of stimuli: familiar stimuli
are more likely to be attended to than unfamiliar stimuli.
Second, given comparable familiarity, young children are
more likely to process auditory stimuli than visual stimuli.
This property of young children’s attention is in a sharp
contrast with adults’ attention: under the comparable
familiarity conditions, adults are more likely to attend to
visual stimuli (Sloutsky & Napolitano, 2003). Of course, to
ascertain that the familiarity effects hold for familiar
auditory stimuli (e.g., human speech, bird calls, or car
sounds), additional research manipulating the familiarity of
auditory stimuli is needed.
