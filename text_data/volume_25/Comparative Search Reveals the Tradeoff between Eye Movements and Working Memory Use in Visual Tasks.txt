Method
Participants. Eight students from UMass Boston
participated in the experiment. They were paid for the
participation and did not have any information about the
nature of the study.
Apparatus. Eye movements were recorded with the SR
Research Ltd. EyeLink-II system, which operates at a
sampling rate of 500 Hz and measures a subject’s gaze
position with an average error of less than 0.5 degrees of
visual angle. Stimuli were presented on a 21-inch Dell
Trinitron monitor with a refresh rate of 85 Hz and a screen
resolution of 1152 by 864 pixels.
Materials. The stimulus displays showed two columns of
simple geometrical objects on a white background. The
objects were in three different forms (triangles, circles, and
squares) and three different colors (fully saturated blue,
green and red). They were evenly spaced avoiding item

1996) that verifying a suspected target induces eye-
movement patterns that are substantially different from the
ones generated during the preceding search process.
   The error rate, that is, the proportion of participants’
incorrect responses, did not vary significantly with the
distance between the hemifields, F(2;14) = 3.72, p > 0.05.
Its relatively low value (2.34%, 4.29%, and 1.36% for small,
medium, and large distance, respectively) indicated that
participants performed their task accurately. Interestingly,
while average response time was shorter for small and
medium distance (8.47s and 8.38s, respectively) than for
large distance (8.73s), this difference did not reach
significance, F(2;14) = 1.28, p > 0.3 (see Figure 2, top
panel). As expected, however, the duration of saccades
switching between hemifields did depend on the distance
between them, F(2;14) = 146.65, p < 0.001. Saccade
duration increased significantly with increasing distance
across all its levels - small, medium, and large (58.99ms,
72.58ms, and 101.40ms, respectively) - all t(7) > 11.23, p <
0.001 (see Figure 2, center panel). Thus, eye movements
indeed became more time-consuming or ‘expensive’ with
growing distance between the hemifields. How did
participants adapt to this change in costs?
   First of all, the duration of participants’ processing
intervals – the average time that their gaze remained in the
same hemifield before switching to the other one –
depended significantly on the inter-hemifield distance,
F(2;14) = 13.65, p < 0.001. Larger distance led to longer
processing intervals (439.4ms, 466.4ms, and 531.3ms for
small, medium, and large distance, respectively). While the
differences between large distance and the other two
distances was significant, both t(7) > 3.03, p < 0.05, the
difference between small and medium distance only showed
a tendency, t(7) = 2.17, p = 0.065. Regardless of the
variance in the empirical data, it is evident that participants
reacted to the increased cost of eye movements by spending
more time on processing between switches. The difference
in processing time even clearly exceeded the difference in
saccade duration (see Figure 2, center panel). However, the
longer processing time may also have been caused by more
difficult matching (despite the horizontal lines in the
displays) or increased memory decay during switching. In
order to find evidence for an actual and successful increase
in working memory use due to more expensive eye
movements, we needed to analyze how much information
was actually memorized between switches. This information
was obtained by measuring the number of inter-hemifield
saccades per trial.
   The distance between the hemifields exerted a significant
effect on the number of gaze switches between them,                  Figure 2: Response time (top), duration of processing and

    delay (center), and 1000ms delay (bottom). The lines
                 connect successive fixations.
   The results of Experiment 2 show that participants adapt
to the imposed 500ms visibility delay by dramatically
increasing their working memory load and reducing the
number of expensive inter-hemifield saccades. Adding
another 500ms to the visibility delay, however, causes
participants to increase their working memory load only
very little. Obviously, due to the limited capacity of visual
working memory, it would take participants a
disproportionate amount of time and effort to memorize
more information at a time in order to avoid costly inter-
hemifield saccades. The flexibility of memory use for
optimizing efficiency that determines the results of
