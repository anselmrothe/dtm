   formal representation of Newton’s Second Law (Net force = mass * acceleration) can not only be used to
   solve problems involving stationary objects, but problems with moving objects as well.
 Conceptual specialization: enable the student to understand the distinction between related concepts—e.g.,         5(1,1,2,1)
   the difference between instantaneous, average, and constant acceleration.
 Tactical generalization: encourage and enable the student to use standard “tricks of the trade” for solving        11(4,1,3,1,2)
   quantitative problems, such as breaking complex problems into more manageable sub-goals, reading the
   problem statement carefully, and expressing relations symbolically before instantiating variables.
