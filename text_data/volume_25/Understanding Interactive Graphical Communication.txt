This effect reproduces those found in verbal referential
communication tasks; without feedback speakers’
referring expressions become more elaborate (number
of words) over games (Fussell, 1990; Hupet &
Chantraine, 1992). Furthermore, more closely coupled
graphical interaction allowed partners to maximally
reduce their collaborative effort.
Graphical Convergence. Graphical convergence was

Task and Procedure
Image sampling was conducted such that each
‘overseer’ was exposed to a comparable number of
drawings made in the high, low and zero interaction
conditions, and a representative sample of the different
drawing types produced in each condition (e.g. art
gallery, museum etc.). To negate the effect of
interaction, only the images produced by the first
director from each interacting pair were used (i.e. the
director on game 1). Overseers’ identification success
on this first drawing was compared with that of the           Figure 9. Mean proportion of Early (game 1) and Late

          Each overseer was provided with a workbook
containing 160 images (each image was seen by two
overseers), presented in a random order. To the left of                              Discussion
