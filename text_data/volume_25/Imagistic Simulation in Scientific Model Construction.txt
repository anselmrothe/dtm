  The role of mental simulation in scientific learning processes                        (1)                 (2)

  generate initial hypotheses concerning: the relationship
  between “runnable” schemas and imagery during mental
  simulation; and how assembling a scientific model from
  simpler runnable schemas can “transfer runnability” to the
  model. By the end of their learning episodes both the expert
  and the student appear to have acquired something more than
  a new symbolic relationship. They appear to have an
  imageable, runnable model where the imagability and
  runnability have been transferred or “inherited” from a source
