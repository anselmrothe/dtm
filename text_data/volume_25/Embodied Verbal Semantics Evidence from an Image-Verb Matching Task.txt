   A second remaining research question is whether those
motor structures that are activated during the processing of
language pertaining to motor action are the same structures
that have been demonstrated to become active during the
visual perception of motor actions. The evidence is
mounting that those areas of motor and premotor cortex that
are specialized for particular motor actions also become

subjects were first presented for one second with a stick-
figure image and then were asked to decide as quickly as
possible if a verb they subsequently saw on the screen was a

all depicted actions that were primarily associated with one
body area – the hand, the mouth, or the leg. In half of the
trials, the verb was a good description of the image (the
‘matching’ condition) and in the other half of the trials, it
was not (the ‘non-matching’ conditions).

motion itself, then matching a verb with an image should
