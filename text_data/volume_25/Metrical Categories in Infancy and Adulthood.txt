approximately 4.5 ft in front and to the right and left of the
seated infants. The observer monitored infant looking times
by pressing one of two buttons on the computer, each
corresponding to one monitor. Infants were first presented
with 2 min of the familiarization stimulus, consisting of four
repetitions of the stimulus presented on alternate monitors.
Trials were preceded by a flashing red stimulus to orient the
infant’s attention. When the infant looked at the appropriate
monitor, familiarization trials began and continued for 30 s.
After four familiarization trials, test stimuli were presented
six times each, with the matching and mismatching test
stimuli alternating between monitors. Test trials were
terminated when the infant looked away for more than 2 s or
when 60 s had elapsed.
