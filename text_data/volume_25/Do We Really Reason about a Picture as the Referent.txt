is whether the following type of inferences really exist:       S and S 0 are supply curves in different conditions, and E
                                                                and E 0 are equilibriums in different supply conditions.
   In the presence of a visually accessible graphi-
   cal representation, an agent assumes a hypothetical
   transformation of the graphic that adds a premise
   to it, infers about the result of the transformation,
   and translates an obtained conclusion to a conclu-
   sion about the referent of the graphic.
   In the following, we will call this type of inferences in-
ferences through hypothetical drawing (“HD inference”
for short). We will first clarify the breadth of this concept
by reviewing some representative studies of diagram-
