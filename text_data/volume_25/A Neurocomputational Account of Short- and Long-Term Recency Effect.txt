Abstract
We present a neurocomputational model of free recall
that combines an activation-based short-term buffer and a
weight-based contextual episodic system. The short-term
buffer corresponds to neural principles responsible for
delay activation in the prefrontal cortex and accounts for
recency effects in immediate free recall. The episodic
system corresponds to the medial temporal areas and
implements a changing context, which underlies recency
effects in the continuous distractor task. The model
accounts for effects of listlength and proactive
interference in list memory. In addition, the model
accounts for the dissociation between short- and longterm recency with instructed output order and for a
dissociation found with amnesic patients. This work
provides an initial step towards a fuller understanding of
how the underlying neural principles explain patterns of
memory performance and can be instrumental in
resolving debates in the cognitive/behavioral literature.

Introduction
The free recall paradigm occupies a unique place in the
history of scientific inquiry in immediate memory. It
has led many theorists to speculate about the structure
of human memory by accounting for a wide range of
findings. The task requires participants to report a
sequence of words in any order immediately after its
presentation. When the proportion of words that were
correctly reported is shown as a function of the input
position, it can be found that performance is better for
the first few, primacy, and the last few, recency,
positions. The traditional view is that primacy effects
result from the increased opportunity to rehearse those
words (Rundus & Atkinson, 1970), whereas recency
effects are due to retrieval from a short-term buffer
(Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968). This view found support in
dissociations between primacy and recency effects
(Glanzer & Cunitz, 1966), but was challenged by the
finding of recency effects in a long-term memory task
(Bjork & Whitten, 1974) named the continuous
distractor task. The procedure in the continuous
distractor task is identical to the immediate free recall
task, except for the addition of a distractor task (e.g.
counting backwards) before and after every word.
Although this method is designed to eliminate the
presence of items in the buffer, a long-term recency
effect is found in this task.

The long-term recency effect has been used as
evidence against the existence of a short-term buffer
(Crowder, 1982). Further empirical support for a singlemechanism of recency comes from studies showing that
several variables affect short- and long-term recency in
similar ways (Greene, 1986).
In the cognitive literature, the dominant view on
memory is that a capacity-limited short-term buffer does
not play a role in immediate free recall. However, in the
neuropsychological literature a dissociation between
short- and long-term recency has been reported that
supports a dual-store approach to the free recall
paradigm (Carlesimo, et. al., 1996). This is further
supported by another dissociation, which has largely
been neglected, involving the effect of instructed output
order on the recency effects.
In this paper, a Hebbian view to short-term
maintenance is used, which assumes that the contents of
the short-term buffer is the activated portion of
(semantic) long-term memory representations, in a
specific brain system distinct from the episodic system.
The model presented here is based on the neural
principles that are proposed to underlie active memory
and supplements this with an episodic contextual
encoding/retrieval mechanism. Although various
(process) models of free recall exist (e.g. Anderson, et.
al., 1998; Metcalfe & Murdock, 1981; Raaijmakers &
Shiffrin, 1980), no detailed consideration of the debate
on the existence of a short-term buffer has been carried
out. Here, we show that a neurocomputational model
accounts for basic findings in the free recall task and
gives a coherent explanation for dissociations between
short- and long-term recency.

Neurocomputational Model
The current model is an elaboration of a previous model
(Davelaar & Usher, 2002), where the retrieval process
was approximated by simplified algebraic equations.
Here, a full retrieval process is introduced, in addition to
the use of a changing contextual system. The
architecture is depicted in Figure 1 and contains an
active memory system supported by the prefrontal
cortex and a contextual system mediated by medial
temporal areas.

1992). In the model, the medial-temporal lobe is
simplified as a linear layer of context units. Each unit is
indexed by an integer …, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, … (see Figure
1). At each time-step, one context unit is active. At the
start of a trial (when the GET READY signal is
presented), context unit 0 is activated. With every item
presentation, the context is updated. With probability
Pinc and Pdec, the context moves to the right or left (it
remains at the same position with probability 1 – Pinc –
Pdec). This contextual change resembles a random walk
(see Figure 1) and continues throughout the distractor
interval in the continuous distractor task and during the
retrieval phase. Because the context drifts away from
the starting unit, the contextual system implements a
positional coding mechanism that is sensitive to the
passage of time, as used in recent models of serial recall
that feature a contextual system (e.g. Burgess & Hitch,
1999). The context unit that is active at the end of the
retrieval phase will be the begin context for the
successive trial.

Encoding and Retrieval
At encoding, supra-threshold active prefrontal
representations get associated with active context units.
The episodic trace strength, Si of the connections is
computed as:

Activation-Based Short-Term Memory

Si = ∫{Max[0, F(xi(t)) - ϕ1]}dt,

As in previous publications, the process of active
maintenance is a consequence of self-recurrency in
prefrontal cell-assemblies (Amit, 1995; Carpenter &
Grossberg, 1993). Each unit (corresponding to lexicalsemantic representation, implemented as temporalfrontal loops) has a self-excitatory connection of
strength α and there is a global inhibition of strength β,
which underlies the capacity limitation of the buffer.
The activation of all units (1 to N, N > listlength) are
updated in parallel according to a standard equation
where the activation xi(t) at time t depends on the neural
current in the previous time-step, xi(t-1), the recurrent
input (self-excitation and global inhibition) and the
external input Ii(t), which is supplemented with zeromean Gaussian noise ξ with standard deviation σ.

where ϕ1 (ϕ1 = 0.20) is the activation threshold above
which an item is said to be in active memory. The
resulting matrix of connection weights constitutes the
episodic memory of the list.
At retrieval, items that reside in active memory are
immediately reported (see also Anderson, et. al., 1998;
Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1980), which is followed by a
more elaborate episodic retrieval process. During the
retrieval phase, the context units are still following a
random walk with drift. During this process all
representations that have been associated with the active
context unit compete for output. This competitive
process is approximated by a Luce-choice-rule:

xi(t+1) = λxi(t) + (1-λ)[αF(xi(t)) - β∑F(xj(t)) + Ii(t) + ξ]
(eq. 1)

The activation function F(x) = x/(1+x) (for x > 0, 0
otherwise) is a thresholded function that produces fits
close to the neurophysiological recordings at low firing
rate, while the nonlinearity ensures saturation at high
input (see Usher & McClelland, 2001).

There is a general consensus that structures in the

The parameters, c1 and c2 are scaling parameters. By
default, the retrieval phase starts with the context unit
that is active when the prompt for recall is given. After

(eq. 4)

k (k = 30) cycles of selection and recovery, the context
is reset to the start context and retrieval continues for an
additional k cycles, in line with analyses showing that
participants report recency items first and then continue
with the very first item (Metcalfe & Murdock, 1981).
Several models make use of the begin-cue as a driving
force for recall (e.g. Henson, 1998; Metcalfe &
Murdock, 1981), to start serial recall (Burgess & Hitch,
1999; Henson, 1998) or to account for the large increase
in inter-response time before the first item is reported
(Metcalfe & Murdock, 1981).

Basic Effects
The model described above is used to simulate data on a
trial by trial basis, making it a detailed process model of
free recall memory based on neural principles. In
immediate free recall, recency items are active above
threshold, which gives rise to short-term recency. As
none of the items are active at retrieval in the
continuous distractor task, long-term recency has a
different origin (i.e. retrieval from episodic memory).
For immediate free recall, the model predicts that the
episodic trace strength varies across serial positions,
which reflects the longer duration that primacy items
are active compared to middle list and recency items.
This profile is in line with negative recency effects
found in final free recall (Craik, 1970) and primacy
effects
under
rehearsal-preventing
conditions
(Richardson & Baddeley, 1975). However, the trace
strengths for the list items are uniform in the continuous
distractor task, as every list item remains in the buffer
for equal duration. This implies that not only short- and
long-term recency effects have different sources, but
that this is also true for primacy effects. Moreover, it
suggests that within the current framework, long-term
recency is purely due to changing context.

Listlength
One of the robust findings in memory literature is the
listlength effect in the serial position function
(Murdock, 1962). With increase in the number of items
to be retained, performance for pre-recency items
decreases, whereas the recency effect is relatively
unaffected. Figure 2 shows model predictions for the
results of Murdock (1962). In Murdock’s experiment,
six groups of participants heard a list of words at a rate
of one or two seconds per word for free recall. The lists
varied in length, such that the combinations used in the
experiments were 10-2, 15-2, 20-2, 20-1, 30-1 and 40-1.
The first number denotes the listlength and the second
number refers to the duration for which a word was
presented. As can be seen in Figure 2, the model
accounts for the typical serial position function with
primacy and S-shaped recency. It also predicts the
decrease in recall performance with increase in
listlength, which is fully due to the decrease in the
probability of selection.

Proactive Interference
The model also accounts for proactive interference in
immediate free recall (Craik & Birtwistle, 1971; see
Figure 3). Craik and Birtwistle (1971) conducted an
experiment in which participants performed five
immediate free recall trials with 15 words per list. One
group of participants received trials where all 75 words
came from the same semantic category (e.g. animal
names), whereas for a second group, the first four trials
contained words from the same category, but the fifth
trial (release-trial) contained words from a different
category (e.g. fruit and vegetable). They argued that
proactive interference in the fifth trial affected only the
contribution from episodic memory. In the model,
proactive interference was simulated by assuming that

the episodic traces of the previous trial compete in the
selection process of the current trial (see for a similar
view, Wixted & Rohrer, 1993). In the simulation, two
trials were run. The first trial was equivalent to those in
the previous simulation. The context unit that was active
at the end of the retrieval phase of the first trial was
automatically the context unit that becomes associated
with the start-cue of the second trial. During the
episodic retrieval of the items of the second list, the
traces of the first trial compete in the selection
probability, as list-1 and list-2 items share similar
episodic context and belong to the same semantic
category. As can be seen in Figure 3, the model predicts
the decrease of performance of pre-recency items, while
at the same time the recency items are unaffected. This
is due to recency items being reported from active
memory, which is not affected by proactive
interference.

As mentioned earlier, there are several dissociations
between short- and long-term recency effects that
disqualify the claim that all recency effects can be
explained with a single retrieval mechanism. Two
dissociations are simulated, adding additional support
for a Hebbian dual-trace model of human memory.

Instructed Output Order
Dalezman (1976) conducted an immediate free recall
experiment and asked participants to start their recall
with items from the beginning or end of the list. He
found that the recency effect was abolished when
participants started recall with the first items (primacyfirst condition), whereas a recency effect was present
when retrieval started with the end-of-list items
(recency-first condition). Whitten (1978) conducted a
similar study with the continuous distractor task and did
not find any effect of starting position on the serial
position function. The effect of instructed output order
was simulated by starting the retrieval phase with the
begin- or end-context cue for 30 attempts followed by
another 30 attempts with the other cue. Note that in both
conditions both cues are used, but that the order in
which the cues are used depends on the instruction. In
the case of immediate free recall, the recency-first
instruction leads to the emptying of the buffer. For the
primacy-first instruction, it is assumed that the retrieval
of items interferes with the contents of the short-term
buffer. Therefore, the items that were active at the
beginning of the retrieval phase have been displaced by
the time the end-cue is used. At that time, only the
episodic traces can drive recall, which are then similar
in strength to that of middle list items (like in delayed
free recall). For the continuous distractor task on the
other hand, changing the order in which the cues are
used does not affect the serial position function, as no
changes in episodic trace strength or active memory
contribution (which is absent) occur. Figure 4 shows the
model results, which are in agreement with the

empirical data. The long-term recency effect is due to
the higher probability that the end-context was active
during encoding of the final items, whereas the longterm primacy effect is purely due to the use of the
begin-context to drive further recall.

General Discussion
The model accounts for dissociations between shortand long-term recency, which have figured prominently
in the debate on single- versus dual-store theories. The
model implements the short-term buffer according in a
Hebbian way; the buffer is not a distinct system, but the
activated part of (semantic) long-term memory
representations in the prefrontal cortex, while the
episodic memory corresponds to synaptic weights to
context representations.
Compared to other process models (e.g. Anderson,
et. al., 1998; Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1980), the current
model implements a dynamic activation-based buffer
system whose capacity is determined by a competitive
activation process. This approach links with the
neurophysiological findings of sustained prefrontal
activation after stimulus offset (e.g. Miller, Erickson &
Desimone, 1996) and behavioral studies on presentation
rate effects (Davelaar, 2003). The current model makes
a distinction between episodic and semantic memory,
where lexical-semantic representations correspond to
units of the temporal-frontal system, while episodic
memory is encoded in the links between context and
those units. Elsewhere, we explored semantic clustering
effects in free recall by allowing weak excitatory links
between the buffer units. Like the single-store model by
Howard and Kahana (2002), but unlike the above
models, the current model accounts for long-term
recency (and long-term primacy) through a changing
context representation. The asymmetry in the drift of
contextual change accounts for asymmetric lag-recency
effects (Davelaar, 2003) without postulating additional
processes, like retrieval of pre-experimental context
(Howard & Kahana, 2002). Future research could
explore the specifics on the contextual system including
its neural underpinnings. As a first approximation a
drifting random walk process forms a good alternative.

Amnesic Patients

proportion correct

Carlesimo and colleagues (Carlesimo, et. al., 1996)
showed that compared to matched control participants,
amnesic patients have lower performance levels for the
pre-recency positions in immediate free recall and for
all positions in the continuous distractor task. It is
important to stress that the absolute level of short-term
recency is unaffected, that the absolute level of longterm recency is affected and that the slope of long-term
recency is still unaffected. Marks and Cermak (1998)
showed that amnesic patients are still sensitive to the
ratio between inter-presentation and retention interval,
indicating that the mechanism underlying long-term
recency is not deficient in these patients. The model
accounts for the dissociation in absolute levels of
recency by assuming that as these amnesic patients have
damage to the medial-temporal lobe, the episodic
strengths are lower or more difficult to use. In the
current simulation, episodic strengths were decreased by
a factor of 100 to implement this deficiency in
efficiency of episodic traces. The probabilities
underlying the contextual random walk remained
unchanged. As the strengths are only used in episodic
retrieval, all positions in the continuous distractor task,
but only prerecency positions in immediate free recall
should be affected by this procedure, as can be seen in
Figure 5. All serial positions for which the items are
reported via episodic retrieval are reduced. Moreover,
the model predicts that the slope of the long-term
recency effect is unaffected (see Marks & Cermak,
1998).
