from the interface of culture and cognition, the place of
embodiment, knowledge as situated, distributed cognition,
the way that modeling may work as embedded cognition
rather than secondary to abstract symbol manipulation, are
similarly springboards to develop the idea of culture as an
analytic category. Once these dimensions are drawn out and
others inevitably added, we may gain a much better sense of
how culture is intrinsic to cognition and informs some its
possibilities as well as being a condition of perhaps
inevitable cognitive failures.
