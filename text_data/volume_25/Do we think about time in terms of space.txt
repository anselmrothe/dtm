Abstract
The human capacity for abstract thought poses an unsolved
problem for the neural and cognitive sciences. How are people
able to think about things that they can never see or touch, like
ideas, mathematics, or time? A potential solution has emerged
independently from such diverse fields as evolutionary biology
and cognitive linguistics: the mind recruits old structures for
new uses. It has been proposed, for example, that sensory and
motor processes underlying spatial cognition are co-opted to
support our thinking about phenomena such as mathematics
and time. Empirical support for this proposal has been elusive.
Until recently, arguments have rested largely on patterns
observed in human language. Here we present a series of
psychophysical experiments that investigate mental
representations in the abstract domain of time and in the
perceptually richer domain of space. Results show that people
rely on spatial information to estimate time, but not the other
way around. These studies provide some of the first entirely
nonlinguistic evidence that spatial representations subserve
temporal representations, and suggest a new way to explore the
perceptual foundations of abstract thought.

Introduction
As humans, we have the unique capacity to think about
immaterial things that we can never experience through the
senses (e.g., courage, gravity, electrons), as well as
imaginary things that we can never experience at all (e.g.,
negative numbers, time travel). How do we do it? One
hypothesis is that we mentally represent abstract entities that
we cannot see or touch in terms of things that we can
perceive directly (Boroditsky, 2000; Boroditsky & Ramscar,
2002; Emmory, 2001; Gattis, 2001; Gibbs, 1994; Goldstone
& Barsalou, 1998; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, 1999; Pinker,
1989, 1997; Talmy, 1988). In support of this proposal,
linguists and psychologists have noted that we often talk
about the abstract in terms of the relatively concrete. For
example, people tend to talk about time in terms of space.
In English, we use expressions like ‘putting the past behind
us’, ‘proposing theories ahead of their time’, and ‘looking
forward to the future’. Spatial metaphors for time are
highly systematic within languages, and are pervasive
across languages (Alverson, 1994; Boroditsky, 2001; Clark,
1973; Gentner, 2001; Tversky, Kugelmass, & Winter,
1991). Do spatiotemporal metaphors reveal something
fundamental about the our temporal representations? It is
tempting to infer from these patterns in language that our

216

conception of time is somehow grounded in our conception
of space, but this would be scientifically imprudent. The
fact that we talk about time using spatial words does not
entail that we think about time using spatial representations.
Nonlinguistic evidence is needed to elucidate the
relationship between space and time in the human mind.
In the present study, we investigated spatial and
temporal representations using simple psychophysical tasks
with nonlinguistic stimuli and responses.
Subjects
estimated either the duration or the spatial displacement of
stimuli presented on a computer screen. In the first
experiment, subjects viewed lines that ‘grew’ horizontally
across the screen from left to right, and disappeared as soon
as they reached their maximum displacement.
Line
durations and displacements were varied orthogonally, so
there was no correlation between the spatial and temporal
components of the stimuli.
As such, one stimulus
dimension served as a distractor for the other: an irrelevant
bit of information that could potentially interfere with task
performance. Patterns of cross-dimensional interference
were analyzed to reveal relationships between our
representations of space and time.
Space and time are asymmetrically dependent in
linguistic metaphors: we tend to talk about time in terms of
space more than we talk about space in terms of time
(Boroditsky, 2000; Clark, 1973; Gentner, 2001). Are mental
representations of space and time also asymmetrically
dependent? In English, we often use words that quantify
spatial displacement (e.g., a long line, a short rope) in order
to talk about the duration of an event (e.g., a long meeting, a
short concert). Is it possible that people use representations
of spatial displacement in order to think about duration?
We hypothesized that if mental representations of time
depend on mental representations of space, but not the other
way around, then any cross-dimensional interference
observed during subjects’ behavioral responses would be
asymmetric: line displacement would affect estimates of line
duration more than line duration affected estimates of line
displacement.
Alternatively, if spatial and temporal
representations are mutually interdependent, then crossdimensional interference should be approximately
symmetric: line displacement should modulate subjects’
estimates of line duration, and vice-versa. If spatial and
temporal representations are independent, then no
significant cross-dimensional interference should be found.

Experiment 1: Growing Lines
Experiment 1 investigated whether cross-dimensional
interference would be detected in subjects’ estimates of the
duration or the displacement of moving stimuli, and whether
any observed interference of one domain on the other would
be symmetric or asymmetric.

Methods
Participants 9 native English speakers from the MIT
community participated in these studies in exchange for
payment.
Materials Lines were presented on a computer monitor
(resolution=1024x768 pixels, dpi=72). Durations ranged
from 1000 milliseconds to 5000 milliseconds in 500
millisecond increments. Displacements ranged from 200 to
800 pixels in 75 pixel increments. Nine durations were
fully crossed with nine displacements to produce 81 distinct
line types. Lines ‘grew’ horizontally across the screen one
pixel at a time, from left to right along the vertical midline,
at rates ranging from 40 pixels/second to 800 pixels/second.
Lines started growing 112 pixels from the left edge of the
monitor on average, but the starting point of each line was
jittered with respect to the average starting point (+/- up to
50 pixels), so that the monitor would not provide a reliable
spatial frame of reference. Each line remained on the screen
until its maximum displacement was reached.
Procedure Participants viewed 162 growing lines, one line
at a time. The word “ready” appeared in the center of an
otherwise blank screen for two seconds immediately before
each line was shown. Immediately after each line, a prompt
appeared in either the upper left or lower left corner of the
screen indicating that the subject should reproduce either the
line’s displacement (if an ‘X’ icon appeared), or its duration
(if an ‘hourglass’ icon appeared). Space trials and time
trials were randomly intermixed.
To estimate displacement, subjects clicked the mouse
once on the center of the X, moved the mouse in a straight
line to the right, and clicked the mouse a second time to
indicate they had traversed a distance equal to the maximum
displacement of the stimulus. Whereas stimuli grew from a
jittered starting point on the vertical midline of the screen,
responses were initiated at a fixed starting point in either the
upper or lower left corner. Thus, the response was
translated both vertically and horizontally with respect to
the stimulus. To estimate duration, subjects clicked the
mouse once on the center of the hourglass icon, waited the
appropriate amount of time, and clicked again in the same
spot, to indicate the time it took for the stimulus to reach its
maximum displacement.
All responses were self-paced. Importantly, for a given
trial, subjects reproduced either the displacement or the
duration of the stimulus, never both. Response data were
collected for both the trial-relevant and the trial-irrelevant

217

stimulus dimension, to ensure that subjects were following
instructions.

Results and Discussion
Results show a strong cross-dimensional effect of
displacement on duration estimation, but no significant
effect of duration on displacement estimation (figure 1a-b).
For stimuli of the same average duration, lines that traveled
a shorter distance were judged to take a shorter time, and
lines that traveled a longer distance were judged to take a
longer time.
Subjects incorporated irrelevant spatial
information in their temporal estimates, but not vice-versa.
This behavioral asymmetry was predicted based on the
asymmetric relationship between time and space in
linguistic metaphors.
Overall, subjects’ estimates of
duration and displacement were highly accurate, and about
equally accurate across the two domains (figure 1c-d). The
asymmetric cross-dimensional interference we observe
cannot be attributed to a difference between the accuracy of
subjects’ duration and displacement estimations, as no
significant difference was found.
Since speed and displacement were positively
correlated in our experimental design, it was important to
distinguish their effects on time estimation. A post-hoc
analysis showed that the effect of line displacement on
estimated duration remained highly significant when the
effects of line speed and target duration were controlled
(r=0.14; df=725; p<0.0001). In contrast, the effect of speed
on duration estimation was not significant when the effects
of target duration and target displacement were controlled
(r= -0.02; df=725; ns).

Experiment 2:
Growing Lines, Selective Attention
What was the source of this cross-dimensional confusion?
In Experiment 1, subjects did not know until immediately
after each line was presented whether they would need to
estimate displacement or duration. It was important for
them to attend to both spatial and temporal information, and
to update both types of information online throughout the
stimulus presentation. If subjects were told ahead of time
whether they would need to estimate a line’s displacement
or its duration, would the cross-dimensional interference
disappear?
Experiment 2 addressed this possibility.
Subjects were informed immediately before each line
appeared which stimulus dimension they would need to
estimate. Thus, subjects had the opportunity to selectively
attend to the trial-relevant stimulus dimension, and if
possible, to ignore the trial-irrelevant dimension.

Materials and Procedure
Stimulus materials were
identical to those used in Experiment 1. The procedure was
also identical, with one exception. In Experiment 1, the
word “ready” appeared in the middle of an otherwise blank
screen for two seconds immediately preceding each line
stimulus. In Experiment 2, the word “ready” was replaced
either by the word “space” next to an X icon, or by the word
“time” next to an hourglass icon. These words and symbols
indicated whether the subject would need to estimate the
displacement or the duration of the next line. Line stimuli,
prompts, and responses were exactly as in Experiment 1,
thus all stimuli and responses remained entirely
nonlinguistic.

Results and Discussion
Results of Experiment 2 replicate those of Experiment 1.
Subjects were able to disregard line duration when
estimating displacement. In contrast, subjects appeared
unable to ignore line displacement, even when they were
encouraged to selectively attend to duration (figure 2a-d).
The cross-dimensional effect of space on time in
Experiment 1 was not induced by a task-specific demand for
subjects to encode spatial and temporal information
simultaneously.
Response data collected for the trial-irrelevant dimension
confirm that subjects understood the task, and were not
explicitly confusing displacement with duration (i.e., Ss
were not giving a spatial response when they were supposed
to give a temporal response).

previous experiments, rather it was fixed at 6400
milliseconds. Stimuli were preceded and followed by a
delay period, which was proportional to spatial gap
separating the ends of the line stimuli from the left and right
edges of the monitor.

Results and Discussion
The cross-dimensional effects found in Experiments 1 and 2
remained qualitatively unchanged in Experiment 3 (figure
3c).

Experiment 4: Reverse Lines
In the first three experiments, lines grew from left to right,
consistent with the direction of reading and writing in
English, and the direction of increase in many graphs . Is it
possible that we learn an association between progress in
space and time through the habit of scanning across the
printed page, and that this association contributes to the
observed cross-dimensional interference? For Experiment
4, lines grew from right to left. If habitual reading/writing
direction were responsible for the positive association
between spatial input and temporal estimation in the
previous experiments, then a negative association between
stimulus displacement and estimated duration would be
expected in the present experiment.

Experiment 3:
Temporal Frame of Reference
Several follow-up experiments were conducted to
corroborate the results of Experiments 1 and 2, to assess
their generality, and to evaluate potential explanations. One
concern was that subjects may have relied on spatial
information to make temporal estimates because stimuli
were situated in a constant spatial frame of reference (i.e.,
the computer monitor). For experiment 3, stimuli were also
situated in a constant temporal frame of reference. Delay
periods were introduced preceding and following line
presentations, which were proportional to the gaps between
the ends of the stimulus lines and the edges of the monitor.

community participated in this study in exchange for

Materials and Procedure Stimulus materials and
procedures were identical to those used in experiment 2,
with the following exception. The interval between the
disappearance of the ready screen and the appearance of the
response prompt did not vary with stimulus duration as in

219

Materials and Procedure Stimulus materials and
procedures were identical to those used in experiment 2,
with the following exceptions. Whereas lines grew from
left to right in experiment 2, they grew from right to left in
experiment 4. Displacement estimations were made by
moving the mouse from right to left.

Results and Discussion
Results showed that as before, duration estimations varied
positively as a function of line displacement, whereas
displacement estimations did not vary significantly as a
function of line duration (figure 3d). Since the asymmetric
dependence of temporal estimation on spatial input can be
demonstrated whether lines grow from left to right or from
right to left, it is unlikely that this effect arises from our
experience of reading text or interpreting graphs.

Experiment 5: Moving Dot
Was the visual percept of a long line necessary to lengthen
subjects’ temporal estimates, or would a more abstract
experience of displacement suffice?
Experiment 5
addressed this question. Rather than viewing a growing
line, subjects viewed a moving dot. Whereas the spatial

extent of a line stimulus could be perceived directly, the
extent of a dot’s path had to be imagined. In order to
compute the distance that a dot traveled, subjects had to
retrieve the dot’s starting point from memory once its
ending point was reached.

Experiment 6: Stationary Lines

Materials and Procedure
Stimulus materials and
procedures were identical to those used in experiment 2,
with the following exceptions. Rather than viewing a
growing line, subjects viewed a dot which moved
horizontally across the midline of the screen from left to
right.

How might this relationship between distance and duration
arise? One possibility is that we are sensitive to the
correlation of displacement and duration in our everyday
experience with moving objects: any change in an object’s
position is necessarily accompanied by a change in time.
Spatial change may serve as an index of temporal change,
which we use because motion through space is more directly
perceptible than motion through time. Experiments 1-5
used moving stimuli. Would the asymmetric relationship
between space and time be found if static stimuli were used?
In Experiment 6, subjects viewed stationary lines of various
lengths, which remained on the screen for various durations,
according to the parameters used in the original growing
line experiments. It was predicted that the effect of
displacement on duration estimation would be mitigated,
since spatial and temporal changes are correlated in our
experience of moving objects, but not stationary objects.

Results and Discussion

Methods

Results showed a strong and asymmetric dependence of
time on space (figure 3e), suggesting that subjects’ abstract
representations of displacement were sufficient to modulate
temporal estimates.

Materials and Procedure Stimulus materials and
procedures were identical to those used in experiment
2, with the following exception. Rather than viewing
moving lines, subjects viewed stationary lines of
various lengths, which remained on the screen for
various durations, according to the parameters used in
experiment 2.
Results and Discussion
Results showed the same pattern of cross-dimensional
interference found in all previous experiments (figure 3f).
Subjects’ time estimates were asymmetrically dependent on
stimulus displacement, even in the absence of stimulus
motion. Notably, however, the effect of displacement on
time estimation was significantly weaker in Experiment 6
than in the comparable experiment that used moving lines
(difference of slopes=0.44; t= 4.00; df=14; p<0.002).

General Discussion and Conclusions
When Piaget (1927/1969) investigated kids’ reasoning about
space and time, he found that children often based their
judgments of duration on their experience of displacement.
For example, when asked to judge the relative duration of
two trains traveling along parallel tracks, kids often reported
(erroneously) that the train that went the longer distance
took the longer time. Piaget concluded that children could
not reliably distinguish the spatial and temporal components
of moving stimuli until about age nine. Like many
contemporary results in cognitive science, our findings
suggest that Piaget was right about the phenomenon he
observed, but wrong about the age at which kids resolve
their confusion: apparently MIT undergraduates cannot
reliably distinguish the spatial and temporal components of
their experience, either.
Together, Experiments 1- 6 demonstrate that we rely on
spatial information to make temporal estimates, particularly
when space and time are conflated in motion. Conversely,
these experiments provide no evidence that we use temporal
information to make spatial estimates.
This behavioral
asymmetry reflects the directionality of spatiotemporal
metaphors in language, and suggests that the metaphoric
relationship between time and space is not just linguistic, it
is also conceptual. Not only do we talk about time in terms
of space, we also think about time using spatial
representations. Time is only one of the domains that we
spatialize in language: musical pitches can be high or low,
numbers can be large or small, hopes and expectations can
rise or fall. Further experiments are needed to explore the
possibility that domains other than time are also
conceptually grounded in space, and to determine whether
spatial metaphors in language simply mirror underlying
conceptual structures, or whether language plays a role in
shaping relationships between spatial representations and
abstract thought.
