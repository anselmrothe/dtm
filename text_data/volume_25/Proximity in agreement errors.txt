                       Conclusion
A plausible conclusion from these experiments is that
proximity effects on number marking are restricted to
constructions where syntactic constraints are very weak.
Otherwise erroneous number marking appears to
depend on the dynamics of plural feature activation and
percolation and maybe late pragmatic processing stages.
