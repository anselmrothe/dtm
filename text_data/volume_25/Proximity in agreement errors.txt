the classical attraction error at least partially and at least
in English is caused by number marking on a close
interfering noun.

Abstract
Across languages subject-verb agreement errors have
been established when subjects are producing complex
(NP PP) noun-phrases (see Bock, 1995, for an overview).
Very recently, Haskell & MacDonalds (2002) proposed a
locality-based principle, the principle of proximity, to
explain a variety of agreement errors in production. They
base they argument partly on preferences in verb number
marking in sentences with disjunctive noun phrases (e.g.,
"the hat and the gloves" vs. "the gloves and the hat"),
where they found a preference for number marking that
matched the local noun. We will present a series of five
written production experiments on German constructions
with disjunctive Subjects, NP PP Subjects and SubjectObject-verb subordinate clauses. We will show that although comparable effects can be established for
German sentences with disjunctive Subjects - a
proximity based principle fails to cover major portions of
the results. We propose an account that highlights the
dynamics of plural-feature activation and percolation.

a. The hat or the gloves is/are red.
b. Is/are the hat or the gloves red?

We ran a series of five written production experiments
to test the proposed mechanisms in German. The logic
of the argument is that if we can replicate the mismatch
effect (Experiment I) as well as the effect of order in
disjunctions (Experiment II) a proximity based
explanation should work in German as in English.
However, proximity should also work in a case that is
special for German, i.e. verb final subordinate clauses
where the number marking on an object NP might
interfere with number marking on the Subject
(Experiments III, IV, and V). Since number marking on
the object cannot percolate to the Subject in any way,
no effect of an interfering object NP is expected from a
“feature-percolating”-approach.

Introduction
It is well known by now that occasionally subjects
erroneously produce plural verbs following a plural
modifier in constructions like (1; quoted form Bock &
Miller, 1991).
(1) The readiness of our conventional forces are at an
all-time low.
The mechanism underlying this error is attributed to the
marked plural feature percolating up the tree too far
(Vigliocco & Nicol, 1998). This account is
substantiated by the fact that no comparable
singular/plural mismatch effect for constructions with
marked plural heads has been established so far.
Very recently, Haskell and MacDonald (2002) proposed
a principle of proximity as an alternative explanation.
They showed that in disjunctions like (2), subjects have
a strong preference to match the number marking on the
verb with the more local noun. In addition to
distributional evidence, this was taken to indicate that

Experiment I
In Experiment I we tried to replicate the well-known
mismatch effect in NP PP constructions. Materials were
tested for plausibility (all four conditions were
approximately equally plausible).

Design
Two factors were varied in this first experiment: The
factor “Match”: matching (1,4) or mismatching (2,3)
number marking on head noun and local noun, and the
factors “Number of the head noun”: singular (1,2) or
plural (3,4) head noun.

considerably high number of agreement errors for plural
marked head nouns, presumably reflecting a tendency
to produce singular marked verb.

Materials
Sixteen sentence sets (four per condition) were
constructed following the pattern in (1) to (4). The
materials were pre-tested such that all four NP PP
combinations were equally plausible, since effects of
plausibility on production errors have been established
in earlier experiments (Branigan et al., 1995; Hölscher
& Hemforth, 2000; Vigliocco et al., 1995, 1996).

Experiment II closely follows the design by Haskell &
MacDonalds (2002), trying to replicate the effect of
number marking of a local noun on the (written)
production of German finite auxiliaries.

Design

In Experiments I to IV, 62 subjects (all native speakers
of German) received a booklet with constructions
missing an auxiliary which they had to fill in. All
materials were part of the same booklet. Materials were
individually randomized. Participants were paid a small
amount or received course credits for participation.

Results
Number marking on the head noun clearly affected the
percentage of agreement errors (Factor “Number of
head noun”: F1(1,61) = 22,5; p < 0.001). Neither the
factor “Match” nor the number * match interaction
reached significance. However, whereas no difference
in matching versus mismatching local nouns could be
established for sentences with plural marked head
nouns (F1, F2 < .5), planned comparisons showed a
marginal effect with singular marked head nouns
(F1(1,61) = 3.88, p < 0.06; F2(1, 14) = 3.71; p < 0.08).
Matching the literature, more agreement errors can be
found for singular-plural ordering than for plural
singular (e.g. Vigliocco & Nicol, 1998).

Discussion
In Experiment I we replicated the well-known
mismatch effect (e.g. Bock & Miller, 1991). In those
cases, where the local mismatching noun was marked
for plural, the number of agreement errors increased. In
line with earlier experiments on written production
(e.g., Branigan et al., 1995; Fayol, Largy, & Lemaire,
1994; Hölscher & Hemforth, 2000), we found a

In Experiment II, the two experimental factors were

plural (5,8), and “position of the auxiliary: auxiliary

(8) _________ die Handschuhe oder der Hut rot?
_________ the gloves or the hat red.

Materials
Twenty sentence sets following the pattern exemplified
in (5) to (8) were constructed.

Results
As can be seen from Figure 2, number marking on the
verb was strongly influenced by the number marking on
the local noun (F1(1, 61) = 60,88; p < 0.001; F2(1, 19)
= 42,3; p < 0.001). Moreover, more singular marked
verbs were produced when the auxiliary preceded the
disjunctive NP. However, this effect was mainly due to
the particularly high number of singular marked
auxiliaries preceding a singular local noun, which
shows up in a reliable interaction (local noun * position:
F1(1,61) = 19,79; p < 0.001; F2(1,19) = 37,38; p <
0.001).

Results

Experiment II clearly shows that proximity does have
an effect on verb number marking for sentences with
disjunctive Subjects. This is fully compatible with data
on English number marking presented by Haskell and
MacDonalds (2002). However, for disjunctive Subject
NPs, there does not exist a clear grammatical rule for
number marking. Intuitively, singular as well as plural
marking are acceptable when the local noun is singular
marked. Experiments III to V will investigate in how
far the proximity effect extends to more strongly
constrained domains.

Number marking on the Subject had a strong effect on
the number of agreement errors: more errors were
produced following a plural Subject (F1(1,61) = 17.04,
p < 0.001; F2(1,14) = 14,65; p < 0.001). For these
sentences, planned comparisons also showed a marginal
mismatch effect, in that more errors were produced
when the local Object-NP was singular marked
(F(1,61)=3.83; p < 0.06; (F2(1,14)=3,46, p < 0.09).

A proximity based explanation of the mismatch effect
should result in a comparable pattern of errors in
German subject-object-verb clauses. This was
investigated in Experiment III.

Materials
Sixteen sets of sentences were constructed, following
the pattern in (9) to (12). To be sure that the first noun
phrase was interpreted as the subject of the sentence,
either NP1 (9, 10) or NP2 (11) were unambiguously
case marked (nominative Subject in 9,10; accusative
Object in 11). Only the plural-Subject/plural-Object
condition (12) did not allow for unambiguous case
marking.

Discussion
With respect to the proximity principle, the results from
Experiment III are rather mixed and somewhat
surprising. The typical singular/plural mismatch effect
that we established in Experiment I for NP-PP-Subjects
did not show up here. However, a mismatch effect was
found for sentences with plural marked Subjects
followed by singular marked objects. Before we discuss
this result in more detail, we want to make sure, that in
particular the lack of a mismatch effect in sentences
with singular marked Subjects is not due to the use of
masculine NPs (9,10) as Subjects. Schriefers and van
Kempen (1993) only found agreement errors in German
in constructions with feminine head nouns.

Experiment IV
Experiment IV replicates Experiment III with the only
difference that subject-object ordering is marked by
semantic plausibility instead of case marking.

Design
As in Experiment III the two experimental factors
varied in this experiment were “Match”: matching
(13,16) or mismatching (14,15) number marking on
Subject NP and local object NP, and “Number”:
singular (13,14) or plural (15,16) Subject NP.

Materials
Twenty sentence sets following the pattern in (13) to
(16) were constructed. Whereas in Experiment III case
marking was applied to assure that NP1 was interpreted
as the Subject and NP2 as the Object of the sentence,
sentences in Experiment IV were disambiguated by
semantic plausibility.

Experiment V
One of the reasons why attraction errors occur in NP PP
verb constructions may be that the local noun is
erroneously taken as the Subject of the sentence
(Hartsuiker, pers. comm.). So maybe we did not find
object attraction in Experiments III and IV because
explicit case marking in Experiment III and semantic
plausibility in Experiment IV prevented the object from
being mistakenly interpreted as the Subject of the
sentence. We therefore ran a further study derived from
the materials in Experiment III, where case marking
could not be used to assign functional roles. Although
there is a very strong preference to interpret these
sentences as subject-object-verb orderings, they are,
strictly speaking, ambiguous. Therefore, we ran a pretest in order to take care that subjects understood the
first noun phrase as the Subject and the second noun
phrase as the object of the sentence.

Design
The design was identical to that in Experiment III:

(F1(1,61)=13,72; p < 0.001; F2(1,19)=14.84; p <
0.001). Again, we did not find a mismatch effect for
sentences with singular subjects (all Fs < 0.5).
However, the number of errors increased, when a plural
Subject was followed by a singular Object (F1(1,61) =
3.90; p < 0.06; F2(1,19) = 3,28; p < 0.09)

Experiments III and IV, there was no reliable mismatch
effect for sentences with plural head nouns. However –
though only across subjects – the interaction match by
Subject number marking was marginally reliable

Discussion
Although the results are not as clear as in the earlier
experiments with respect to the mismatch effects for
sentences with plural marked Subjects, the pattern is
very similar. Very clearly, the lack of a mismatch
effects for sentences with singular marked subjects is
not due to the fact that the Object-NP could not be
interpreted as the Subject in Experiments III and IV.

General Discussion
In Experiment I, we established the usual asymmetry
between singular and plural head nouns with a
mismatch effect showing up for singular head nouns but
not for plural head nouns (though only marginally).
Similar to Branigan (1995) and Hölscher & Hemforth
(2000), more errors were found following plural head
nouns but there was no effect of the number marking on
the modifier.
In Experiment II we could show that our subjects were
highly sensitive to the number marking on the local
noun in disjunctions, although there was a general
tendency for plural verbs. The proximity principle
assumed by Haskell and MacDonald clearly seems to
be at work in disjunctions in German as well. However,
this result stands in contrast to Experiment I, where we
found an asymmetry between singular and plural local
nouns: only plural local nouns modulate the number of
mismatch errors in Experiment I.
In Experiments III and IV, we wanted to find out in
how far the proximity effect extends to different
structures. In German sub-clauses the unmarked
ordering of constituents is subject < object < verb. We
presented our subjects with unambiguous orderings,
disambiguated by case marking in Experiment III and
by plausibility in Experiment IV. If a close plural
marked noun has an effect on number marking on the
verb, there should be an increased number of errors in
sentences like (10) or (14) where a singular subject is
followed by a plural object. However, no effect of the

561

number marking on the object is expected if the
“percolation-approach” is assumed. There is no way the
number marking on the Object could percolate to the
Subject of the sentence, which is a VP-external
argument.
The results of experiments III an IV rule out surface
proximity: No mismatch effect was established for
sentences with singular Subjects. This part of the data is
consistent with Vigliocco and Nicol’s approach as well
as with evidence for syntactic proximity effects shown
by Franck, Vigliocco, & Nicol, 2002).
However, in contrast to Experiment I, we found a
marginal locality effect for sentences with plural
subjects both in Experiment III, IV (and V). There were
more errors (incorrectly produced singular verbs)
following a singular object noun phrase than after a
plural object noun phrase. While this part of the data
appears to support proximity (more erroneous singular
verb productions with singular objects), the earlier half
of the results on singular Subjects does not; plural
Objects did not increase the number of erroneous plural
verb productions. Furthermore, Experiment I on NPPP-V constructions lacks a proximity effect with plural
Subjects, comprising a mirror image of the results
obtained on SOV constructions. Apart from Experiment
II, there is hence no consistent support for the proximity
hypothesis. A plausible conclusion from these
experiments is that proximity only shows (very strong)
effects on number marking if syntactic constraints are
very weak, as in the disjunctions employed in
Experiment II.
The question remaining is why we do find a mismatch
effect on singular Subjects in Experiment I, but on
plural Subjects in Experiments III, IV and V? There are
at least two possible explanations. Both presume a
general tendency to produce singular (unmarked) verbs.
1.

When Subjects in SOV constructions are
marked for plural, the plural feature becomes
activated, but its activation decays so that it
eventually gets lost by the time the agreeing
verb must be produced. More errors (singulars)
will hence be produced with plural Subjects
because the reason to depart from the base
tendency, the plural marking, gets lost in some
cases. This is true for both Subject-PP
(Experiment
1)
and
Subject-Object
constructions (Experiments 3, 4, 5) followed
by a verb. An intervening plural-Object,
however, can reactivate the plural feature, so
that it can be retrieved at the verb more easily.
Errors in plural-plural-verb constructions are
hence reduced compared to plural-singularverb constructions. We assume that the
reactivation of the plural feature is restricted to
verb arguments like Objects. Objects are

2.

directly integrated with the verb, so that its
features can interfere with those of other verb
arguments. In contrast, modifiers of Subject
NPs, like genitives or PPs, are not directly
integrated with the verb, hence no reactivation
of the plural marking of the head noun. The
only way to interfere with the head noun is by
percolation of the plural feature across the
head, increasing the number of erroneous
plural productions.
An alternative explanation is the use of a
rather late monitoring stage, where the basic
tendency to produce a singular verb even with
plural subjects is inhibited by the plural
marking on the object noun phrase. Because an
object is a more salient referent than a noun
modifier, it is more effective that the latter in
inhibiting the singular preference.

It must be noted that our results seem to stand in
contrast to those of Hartsuiker (2001), who did find an
object attraction effect in Dutch SOV constructions. His
study differs from ours in two important respects
though. Firstly, Hartsuiker employed a different
paradigm, a spoken production task, where subjects
were forced to respond very quickly, yielding a much
larger amount of overall errors. The increased cognitive
load in these experiments may have enhanced the
probability for agreement errors (for evidence on the
role of cognitive load see Fayol, Largy, & Lemaire,
1994). Secondly, there is evidence that mismatch errors
are generally much more frequent in Dutch than in
German (Schriefers & van Kempen, 1993). A reason
for this might be that German morphology is much
richer than Dutch morphology, so that morphological
cues are used more effectively in German. The lack of a
mismatch effect in experiments III, IV and V could thus
be due to a floor effect in those conditions where the
error frequency is already extremely low. However, the
floor explanation cannot be applied to experiment I,
since the error frequency with plural Subjects is much
higher than with singular Subjects and nevertheless no
mismatch effect for plurals was found.

Conclusion
A plausible conclusion from these experiments is that
proximity effects on number marking are restricted to
constructions where syntactic constraints are very weak.
Otherwise erroneous number marking appears to
depend on the dynamics of plural feature activation and
percolation and maybe late pragmatic processing stages.
