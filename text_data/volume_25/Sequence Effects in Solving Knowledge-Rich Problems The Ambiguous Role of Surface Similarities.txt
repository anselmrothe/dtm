   In the remainder of the paper these problems for which we
varied the problem-solving sequence will be referred to as
isomorphic problems, because they are structurally identical
(isomorphic) to examples participants had to study before
working on the test problems. In addition to these
isomorphic problems participants had to solve three transfer

known solution procedures. For the transfer problems order
