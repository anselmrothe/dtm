                         Abstract
   Epistemic actions are physical actions people take to                          Rotate
   simplify internal problem solving rather than to move
   closer to an external goal. When playing the video                                    Translate
   game Tetris, for instance, experts routinely rotate
   falling shapes more than is strictly needed to place
   the shapes. Maglio and Kirsh (Kirsh & Maglio, 1994;
   Maglio, 1995) proposed that such actions might serve                                           Drop

responses were given using the index finger of the ob-

In the keypress trials, the sequence of falling pieces
was terminated with an instruction to press either the
Z or / keys, with the specific key being chosen ran-

Tetris and keypress trials, participants were instructed
to emphasize both speed and accuracy.

Mean RT
Our first question was whether the presence of a pre-
view speeded responding relative to the absence of a
preview. Mean RT for the preview-present trials was
528 ms, and the mean RT for the preview-absent tri-
als was 673 ms, with this difference being reliable,
t = 5.09, p < .0001. Our initial examination of the
data from the preview-present trials indicated no main
effects or interactions associated with piece type. Con-
