Sharing Task Representations
The division of labor and the coordination of individual
actions to reach common goals seem to place special
demands on groups and the individuals that are part of
them. From the perspective of individual group
members – on which we will focus in the following - ,
the challenge is to form shared goal representations
with other group members that allow one to coordinate
distributed knowledge and tasks. In real-time
coordination, others’ actions or their effects must be
predicted in order to coordinate one’s own actions with         Figure 1: Setting in the joint go-nogo condition (top),
