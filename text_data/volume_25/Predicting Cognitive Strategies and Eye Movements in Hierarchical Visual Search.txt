  We recognize that cognitive modeling occurs in two
distinct modes: (1) explanatory and (2) predictive. In the
explanatory (or exploratory) mode, models are constructed to
explain empirical data that have already been collected and
analyzed. In the predictive mode, models are constructed to
make a priori predictions of user performance; that is,               Figure 1. A “6-group labeled” layout. The precue,
