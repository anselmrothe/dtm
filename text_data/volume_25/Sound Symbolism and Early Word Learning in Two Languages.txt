make arbitrary English words with no mimetic

symbolism is a universal aspect of language, one that
brings attention to the right properties of complex
events by building on natural perceptual cross-modal
similarities. And, the results indicate that children
learning two languages exploit these similarities
between sound and action when learning verbs.
  These facts raises profoundly important question. If
sound symbolism is naturally present in language use, if           Figure 1: Actions and stimuli used for Experiment 1.
particular sound words help children maping words to
referents, why is not language more iconic? Why aren’t
most words mimetic? The arbitrary symbolic nature of
most words seems likely to bring computational power
that iconic forms cannot. Specifying exactly why this is
so will be important contribution to cognitive sciences.
