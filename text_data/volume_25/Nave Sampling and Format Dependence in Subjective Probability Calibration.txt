limited knowledge in a domain, for example, of the popula-
tions in different world countries. One could, of course, ar-
gue that the experiment and the simulation presented in this
paper only tackles one knowledge domain (i.e. geographical
knowledge). We are, however, convinced that the rational
behind the model can be applied to all knowledge domains
containing continues quantities, for example, estimation of
interest-rate, blood-pressure, stock-values, distance, speed
etc. The basic ideas are further easily conjoined with exem-
plar architectures to predict probability judgments that also
take similarity into account (Juslin & Persson, 2002).
   According to the explanation proposed by the naïve sam-
pling model the overconfidence phenomenon with interval
production is not caused by biased cognitive processing in
any more straightforward or trivial sense (Kahneman, Slovic
& Tversky, 1982). There is no explicit information process-
ing bias, only limited knowledge. In other words, reliance
on small samples which are not corrected relative to popula-
tions generates the overconfidence in interval production.
This view is also inherently more consistent with the obser-
