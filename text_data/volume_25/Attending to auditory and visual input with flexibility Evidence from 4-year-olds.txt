important to note that this does not imply that labels are
unimportant. Rather, these results suggest the possibility
that 4-year-old children might not be particularly wedded
to labels as top-priority auditory information. That is, they
appear to be open to accept more general auditory
information under certain visual stimulus conditions.
Further research is currently examining the specific
quality of these conditions and the underlying
mechanism(s) that influences modality preference in
young children.
