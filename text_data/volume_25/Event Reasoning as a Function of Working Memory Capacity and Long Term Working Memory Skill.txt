local pilots were recruited to participate in the experiment.
Each local pilot was paid $20 per hour for his/her
participation in the two-session (2.5-hour) experiment.
During the first session, pilot WM capacity and LTWM skill
were assessed. In the second session, pilots completed a task
designed to measure SA. Each of the three different tasks is

STM, respectively. Because WM capacity is thought to be
temporary and limited in size, counting backwards by three
from a given number requires processing and storage that
would use WM processes, thus WM capacity could not
account for pilot ability to recall cockpit information.
Furthermore, because there are an infinite number of cockpit
situations, it is difficult to argue that a specific situation is
retrieved as a pattern stored in LTM.
SA Task. In the SA task, each trial consisted of a series of
four screens that depicted a desired flight status, a current
flight situation (cockpit 1), questions about methods to
achieve the desired status (control movement selection), a
future flight situation intermediate to the desired status
(cockpit 2), and one of two types of inquiries about a change
in flight status. Figure 4 depicts the names of each screen
and a schematic of a trial. The present paper focuses on the
consistency judgment that takes place after viewing cockpit
2. The task required for response to the fourth screen of
each trial and the data from those trials will not be discussed
further. What follows is a detailed description of the task as
it relates to the first three screens of each trial.
     The first screen contained text described as a desired
heading, altitude, and airspeed. It also depicted a flight
situation. Pilots were asked to assess the flight situation and
the desired flight status specified in the goal statement and
click “Next” when they felt they knew what flight control
movements would be required to reach the goal. For
example, Figure 4 shows an altitude of 3,530 feet and
airspeed of 95 knots. The goal is to get to an altitude of
3,430 feet and airspeed of 105 knots. To reach the goal, the
pilot would need to descend by moving the elevator
forward. Therefore, on the control movement selection
screen, the pilot would select “Forward pressure on
elevator.”
     After selecting a control movement(s), pilots clicked
“Next” to view the third screen (cockpit 2). The third screen
depicted a future flight situation that resulted from the
application of one or two control movements to the starting
situation (cockpit 1). Cockpit 2 was not affected by the
pilots’ control movement selection. The pilots’ task was to
determine if cockpit 2 accurately depicted a flight situation
that would reach the goal described in the first screen
(cockpit 1) within the next 5 to 10 seconds of mentally
simulated flight. Pilots pressed the keyboard key labeled
“C” if the flight situation was consistent with obtaining the
goal in the next 5 to 10 seconds. If the situation was
inconsistent with obtaining the goal within the next 5 to 10
