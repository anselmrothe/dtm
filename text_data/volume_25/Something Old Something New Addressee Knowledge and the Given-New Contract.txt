Participants. Twenty-four pairs of participants were

Items. For each experiment, we prepared two sets of
items. The DESCRIBER’s set consisted of 24 pairs of
experimental cards and 48 pairs of filler cards. The
pairs of cards included a scenario card which
introduced one entity (and hence making it GIVEN),
and a target card showing that entity and another entity

pairs the target card depicted a transitive action with an
inanimate agent and an animate patient. In the “target”
cards for the filler pairs, 12 pairs depicted an
