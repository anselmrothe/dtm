                                Conclusions
In qualitative terms, then, the SP model seems capable of
addressing some key phenomena from the serial recall
literature. There are clearly many more phenomena in this
domain to which the model must be applied before it can be
considered a serious contender as a model of short term
memory. In one sense, however, the SP account of short
