Discussion
As we predicted, people were able to map the verb onto the
depicted actions, and to use the visual role relations for
rapid online disambiguation of an initial role ambiguity.
Anticipatory inspections to the patient for the SVO
condition allow deducing that participants seem to have
interpreted the temporarily ambiguous character (the
princess) as agent. For the OVS condition, inspections to an
upcoming agent suggest that the initially ambiguous
character was assigned a patient role. We conclude that the                             Figure 3: Example for image with distractor items
