Materials The same center-embedded and right-
branching input sequences were used from Exper-
iments 1A and 1B except that each letter was
mapped onto a consonant-vowel-consonant syllable:
C = “biff”; Q = “rud”; M = “sig”; P = “vot”; X
= “mib”; S = “jux”; W = “nep”; Z = “dak”; K =
“tood”; H = “jic”; T = “cav”; L = “dup”. An
example of a 0-level center-embedded sequence is
“biff-nep”, a 1-level sequence is “biff-vot-cav-nep”,
and a 2-level sequence is “biff-vot-rud-sig-cav-nep”.
An example of a 0-level right-branching sequence is
“biff-nep”, a 1-level sequence is “biff-nep-vot-cav”,
and a 2-level sequence is “biff-nep-vot-cav-rud-sig”.
