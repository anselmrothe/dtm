information across several individuals (but see Ariely et
al., 2000, for an exception). While attention is thus paid
to multiple representations levels—including non-trivial
individual differences in this respect (Juslin et al., in
press), the issue of if and how social interaction affects
the knowledge representations that a person acquires
has not been systematically addressed.

Abstract
Most studies of multiple-cue judgment focus on learning
by individuals. In a multiple-cue judgment task we
examined if people acquire rule or exemplar knowledge
as a function of learning the task alone or in dyads. The
expectation was that learning in dyads should promote
explicit rule-based thinking as a consequence of
increased verbalization (a social abstraction effect) and
produce a larger joint exemplar knowledge base (an
exemplar pooling effect). The results suggest more
accurate judgments by dyads, an exemplar pooling effect,
but no evidence for a social abstraction effect. In contrast
to previous research, the social interaction had beneficial
effects that allowed participants working in dyads to
surpass their combined individual performance.

Social Interaction

Introduction
In research on multiple-cue judgment the explicit or
implicit cognitive interpretation has often been that
people abstract explicit knowledge of cue-criterion
relations that is retrieved and mentally integrated into a
judgment (Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz, 1979;
Juslin, H. Olsson, & A-C. Olsson, in press). Instead of
this explicit rule-based knowledge, research on category
learning has emphasized that judgments are based on
the similarity to memory representations, in particular,
to memory traces of exemplars (Nosofsky & Johansen,
2000). A developing insight is that a complete account
of categorization involves the interplay between
multiple qualitatively distinct representations, including
both explicit rule-based processes and more implicit
memory processes (Ashby, Alfonso-Reese, Turken, &
Waldron, 1998; Erickson & Kruschke, 1998; Juslin,
Jones, H. Olsson, & Winman, 2001; Juslin, et al., in
press; Logan, 1988). This mix, or quasi-rationality, is
also a key-point of cognitive continuum theory of
multiple cue judgment (Hammond, 1996).
Almost all research in category learning and
multiple-cue judgment involve individuals. These
paradigms ignore that judgment is often learned in the
context of social exchange, discussion, and collaboration and that judgments often benefit from pooling

880

It has been shown that members of dyads tend to inhibit
each other from reaching their maximal memory
potential (Andersson & Rönnberg, 1996; Basden,
Basden & Henry, 2000). Dyads thus outperform single
participants on cognitive tasks, but they do not reach
the base-line predicted by the combined performance by
the members of the dyad working alone. Explanations
involve the social loafing phenomenon, stating that a
social situation hampers individual productivity because
of the lack of personal relevance and motivation
(Harkins & Petty, 1982), or lack of co-operation
between group members (North, Linley, & Hargreaves,
2001). In contrast, the principle of nonsummativity (the
whole is greater than the sum of its parts: Zaleznik &
Moment, 1964) suggests that if a group functions under
“psychological independence” the productivity of the
group is more than the summed output of the individual
members. While the rate of convergence is sensitive to
violations of the conditional dyad wise independence,
the asymptotic properties are robust under a variety of
conditions (Johnson, Budescu & Wallsten, 2001).
The social context influences group communication
in different ways (Fleming & Darley, 1991). The
increased communication in dyads as compared to
individuals working alone suggests a shift to a more
analytic representation level, a social abstraction effect,
because verbal interaction is likely to promote explicit
identification of cues and relations between cues. On
the other hand, the availability of the exemplars stored
by two individuals allows more efficient exploitation of
exemplar memory, an exemplar pooling effect.
The present study attempts to investigate if people
making judgments in dyads develop other processes and
knowledge representations than individuals, and, more

generally the reasons for differences in performance
between dyads and individuals (if such exists).

example, after training the rule for cue C1 may specify
that C1=1 goes with a large increase in toxicity.

Figure 1: The continuous judgment task.

Judgment Task
The task requires participants to use four binary cues to
infer a continuous criterion (Juslin et al., in press). The
cover story involves judgments of the toxicity of
subspecies of the exotic (but fictitious) Death Bug. The
subspecies vary in concentration of poison from 50 to
60 ppm (a continuous criterion), where a concentration
below 55 ppm is harmless but a concentration above 55
ppm is lethal. Toxicity can be inferred from four cues of
the subspecies (e.g., length of their legs).
The task structure is summarized in Table 1. The
binary cues C1, C2, C3, and C4 take on values 1 or 0.
The toxicity c of a subspecies is a linear, additive
function of the cue values:
(1)
c = 50 + 4 ⋅ C1 + 3 ⋅ C 2 + 2 ⋅ C 3 + 1 ⋅ C 4 .
C1 is the most important cue with a coefficient of 4 (i.e.,
a relative weight .4), C2 is the second to most important
cue with a coefficient 3, and so forth. A subspecies with
feature vector (0, 0, 0, 0) thus has 50 ppm and is
harmless; a subspecies with feature vector (1, 1, 1, 1)
has 60 ppm and is dangerous. The 16 subspecies (i.e.,
possible cue configurations) are summarized in Table 1.
In a training phase, participants encounter 11
subspecies. In the Experiment, they make continuous
judgments about the toxicity of each subspecies (e.g.,
“The toxicity is 57 ppm”). The judgment task is
illustrated in Figure 1. In a test phase, the participants
make the same judgments as in the training phase, but
for all the 16 subspecies and without feedback. As
illustrated in Figure 1, the bugs were presented in an
analogue format, as pictures of the cue values.

When participants make judgments of the continuous
criterion the cue abstraction model suggests that they
perform a mental analogue of linear multiple
regression. For each cue, a weight ωi (i=1…4) is
retrieved and the estimate of c is adjusted accordingly:
4

cˆ R = k + ∑ ω i ⋅ C i ,

(2)

i =1

where k = 50 + .5 ⋅ (10 − ∑ ω i ) . If ω1=4, ω2=3, ω3=2, and
ω4=1, Equations 1 and 2 are identical and the model
produces perfectly accurate judgments. The intercept k
constrains the function relating judgments to criteria to
be regressive around the midpoint (55) of the interval
[50, 60] specified by the instructions. Note that Eq. 2
captures the core idea that is crucial to mental cue
abstraction: In training, the importance of each cue is
abstracted as a cue weight. At the time of judgment, the
cue weights are retrieved, applied to the cue values, and
integrated into a judgment. The exemplar model implies
that the participants make judgments by retrieving
similar exemplars (subspecies) from memory. When the
exemplar model is applied to judgments of a continuous
criterion variable, the estimate ĉ E of the criterion c is a
weighted average of the criteria cj stored for the J
exemplars, with the similarities S(p,xj) as the weights:

Cognitive Models
The cue abstraction model assumes that participants
abstract explicit cue-criterion relations during training
that become the objects of mental cue integration at the
time of judgment. When presented with a probe, the
participants thus retrieve rules connecting cues to the
criterion (e.g., “Green back goes with being
poisonous”). The rules specify the sign of the relation
and the importance of the cue with a cue weight. For

where p is the probe to be judged, xj is stored exemplar
j (j=1…J), S(p,xj) is the similiarity between probe p and

Schaffer, 1978) applied to a continuum (see, Delosh et
al., 1997; Juslin et al., in press, for similar applications).

where di is an index that takes value 1 if the cue values
on cue dimension i coincide (i.e., both are 0 or both are
1), and si if they deviate (i.e., one is 0, the other is 1). si
are four parameters in the interval [0, 1] that capture the
impact of deviating cues values (features) on the overall
perceived similarity S(p,xj). A value of si close to 1
implies that a deviating feature on this cue dimension
has no impact on the perceived similarity and is
considered irrelevant. A value of si close to 0 means
that the similarity S(p,xj) is close to 0 if this feature is
deviating, assigning crucial importance to the feature.
For low si, only identical exemplars have a profound
effect on the judgments. For example, with all si=.001
identical exemplars receive weight 1, but exemplars
with one deviating feature receive weight .001. With si
close to 1, all exemplars receive the same weight,
regardless of the number of deviating features.

individual participants rely on exemplar memory. When
co-operating in dyads they may continue to exploit
exemplar memory and together they can store more
exemplars in memory leading to improved performance
and superior fit for the exemplar model. The exemplar
pooling effect comes in a weaker statistical version and
a stronger synergetic version. The statistical version
refers to the mere aggregation effect when the exemplar
memories of two individuals are combined. The
synergetic version implies beneficial effects of working
in dyads over and above the mere aggregation effect,
for example, because of better encoding of exemplars
during training or more efficient retrieval at test.

Effects of Training Alone or in Dyads
In the context of the cue abstraction and exemplar
models of concern here, consideration of the task
suggested a number of alternative ways in which people
can adapt to the demand for learning to make judgments
in dyads. A first possibility is an exemplar pooling
effect. This effect is plausible in a task where the

The predictions are summarized in Figure 2. The
models produce similar predictions when the complete
set of exemplars are presented both in training and test
(the upper panels). Panels A and B illustrate that with
appropriate cue weights and low si both models predict
correct judgments. When the extreme exemplars (c= 50
& 60) and three intermediate exemplars (c=.55, 56, &
57) are withheld in training, the models produce distinct
predictions. In the lower panels the cue abstraction
model allows accurate extrapolation beyond the
distribution of criteria in the training set [51, 59].
Whenever the correct signs of the cue weights are
identified, the most extreme judgments are made for
exemplars 1 (c=60) and 16 (c=50). The exemplar model
that computes a weighted average of the observed
criteria can never produce a judgment outside the
observed range (Delosh et al., 1997). The most extreme
judgments are made for criteria c=51 and 59.
With the cue abstraction model there should be no
systematic difference between judgments for the “New”
and “Old” exemplars with c=55, 56, and 57: the process
is essentially the same in both cases. However, with the
exemplar model there is more accurate judgments for
Old exemplars: these judgments benefit from retrieval
of identical exemplars with the correct criterion.

A second way in which the process may be affected
by social interaction is in terms of a social abstraction
effect. One advantage of abstracting explicit
representations of the cue-criterion relations is that it
provides knowledge that is more easily communicated
by verbal means. While it is relatively easy to verbally
explain what specific cues go with high toxicity, it is
exceedingly difficult to communicate the entire content
of an extensive memory of exemplars. We therefore
hypothesized that social interaction, and specifically
verbal interchange, should promote a shift from
exemplar processes to processes of cue abstraction. The
social abstraction effect is evidenced if the data for
individual participants is best accounted for with an
exemplar model, but the data for dyads is best
accounted for with the cue abstraction model.

Method
Participants
Sixty persons participated in the experiment (29 women
and 31 men, with an average age of 23.5 years). The
participants were undergraduate students at Umeå
University and rewarded with 60 SEK with the chance
to win 200 SEK. In the experiment the dyads were
constructed by participants that already knew each other
to lessen the social loafing effect.

Materials and Procedure
The written instructions informed the participants that
there were different subspecies of a Death bug. The
subspecies differed in toxicity between 50 and 60 ppm.
The task was to directly estimate the toxicity of the
subspecies as a number between 50 and 60. The
question on the computer screen was “What is the
toxicity of this subspecies”. In a training phase the
participants received feedback (“This bug has toxicity
57 ppm”). The instructions also informed the
participants about the importance of communication to
make the judgments in dyads.
The subspecies varied in terms of four binary cues;
leg length (short or long), nose length (short or long),
spots or no spots on the fore back, and two patterns on
the buttock. The cues had the weights 4, 3, 2, and 1 (Eq.
1). The weights determine the portion of toxicity that
each cue adds to the total amount. The training phase
consisted of 220 trials, where the 11 training exemplars
in Table 1 were presented 20 times each. The remaining
five exemplars were omitted in the training phase. The
four cues were counterbalanced in continuous criteria
across the participants.
In the test phase, all participants judged all 16
exemplars, twice. The stimulus formats were presented
in two 2x16 blocks, the order of which was
counterbalanced across the participants. No feedback
was provided in the test phase. All participants were
trained and tested with analogue stimuli.

Dependent Measures
Performance is measured by Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) between judgment and criterion. Model
fit is measured by the coefficient of determination (r2)
and the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) between
predictions and data in the test phase.
The old-new difference is measured by the difference
∆ONc between the absolute deviations between
judgment and criterion (i.e., the absolute judgment
error) for the old and the new exemplars with matched
criterion c (i.e., c=55, c=.56, and c=57 in Table 1):
∆ON c = e(c ) Old − e(c ) New , (7)
where e(c) Old is the absolute error for the old exemplar
denoted “O” in Table 1 and e(c) New is the
corresponding absolute error for the new interpolation
exemplar denoted “N” in Table 1. The exemplar model

883

implies that the absolute error is smaller for old
exemplars. Cue-abstraction predicts no systematic
differences between old and new exemplars. ∆ONc is
negative when judgments for old rather than new
exemplars are more accurate. For example, if the
absolute error from the correct criterion of 57 is 1 for
the judgment of the old exemplar (e.g., Exemplar 4 in
Table 1) and 2 for the corresponding new exemplar
(i.e., Exemplar 5), the ∆ONc is -1 for criterion 57
supporting the exemplar model.
Extrapolation is measured by the observed deviation
from linear extrapolation ,

Extrap = 
 ( x − x ) − b , for
50
 51

x c = x 60 , ,

(5)

x c = x 50 .

where ( x 60 - x 59 ) and ( x50 - x 51 ), respectively, are the
slopes of the lines that relate the mean judgments for
exemplars with criteria 60 and 59, and 51 and 50 in the
additive task. b is the difference x 51 - x 50 (or
equivalently x 60 - x 59 ) predicted by a linear regression
relating mean judgments to criteria (see Figure 1). An
Extrap of 0 implies that the judgments for the extreme
exemplars are as extreme as one would expect from
regression-based extrapolation from the old exemplars.
Extrap is 0 when the judgments are correct and for all
linear transformations of the correct judgments. If the
index is negative, extreme exemplars do not receive as
extreme judgments as expected from extrapolation. For
example, if the slope b of a regression line when mean
judgment is plotted against the criterion is .5, but the
slope between x 59 and x 60 is -.5 Extrap is -1 for the
x 60 - x 59 comparison supporting the exemplar model
with its inability to extrapolate. If the slope for the
comparisons x 60 - x 59 equals the overall slope b=.5
Extrap is 0 suggesting appropriate extrapolation.
For ease of exposition of the data reported the two
indices are combined into a single exemplar index ∆E
for the effects predicted by the exemplar model:
(6
∆E =
∆ ON + Extrap ,

∑
T

where T refers to the overall number of new judgments
(both inter- and extrapolation) performed by each
participants. In each test block with all 16 exemplars in
Table 1, there are five new judgments (3 interpolations
and 2 extrapolations). Each participant performed two
test blocks so T is 10. ∆E is 0 for cue abstraction, but
negative in for exemplar memory. (see Juslin, A. C.
Olsson & H. Olsson, in press, for further details).

Results
RMSE was lowest for the condition that involved
training and test in dyads and highest for training and
test as individuals (see Figure 4). RMSE was entered
into a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
training (individual or dyad) and test (individual or
dyad) as between-subjects variables. There were
significant effects of both training, (F(1, 38) = 12.52,
MSE = .70, p = .00) and test (F(1, 38) = 6.45, MSE =

.70, p = .01), but no significant interaction (F(1, 38) =
.00, MSE = .70, p = .98).

Figure 4 presents RMSE for the statistical dyads
compared to other conditions. The statistical dyads
were constructed by forming all possible means based
on the judgments by two individuals in the condition
with individual training and test. In other words, every
judgment is the mean of the judgments made by two
individuals that were trained and tested individually.
Figure 4 illustrates that the individuals tested in dyads
reach the base-line provided by the statistical dyad (i.e.,
the mean of two participants that have both trained and
tested individually), and the individuals that have both
trained and been tested in dyads surpass the statistical
dyad. These results—together with the significant main
effects both of training and testing in dyads—suggest
that there is a synergetic exemplar pooling effect.
The exemplar index ∆E was entered into a two-ways
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with training (individual
or dyad) and test (individual or dyad). There were no
significant effects of training (F(1, 38) = .13, MSE =
2.49, p = .72) or test (F(1, 38) = .50, MSE = 2.49, p =
.48) and no significant interaction (F(1, 38) = .77, MSE
= 2.49, p = .38). The exemplar index ∆E is negative and
significantly different from zero in all conditions, with
the most negative value in individual training-dyad test
condition (-1.08). There is thus no support for the social
abstraction effect. The model fits indicate that the
exemplar model fits somewhat better for dyad training
and the cue abstraction model fits somewhat better for
individual training, as illustrated in Figure 5.

The results thus indicate that participants trained and

illustrated in Figure 3. This beneficial effect arises from
additive effects of both training in dyads—supporting
the synergetic version of the exemplar pooling effect, as
well as of testing in dyads—supporting the aggregation

The question addressed in this article is if different
processes and knowledge representation are developed
if people make judgments individually or in dyads and
how performance differs between participants working
alone or in dyads. We suggested that the effect of social
interaction is of importance for understanding our
judgments and we wanted to investigate if this factor
has an effect on which specific knowledge system that
is used in a multiple-cue judgment task. The results

showed clear differences in performance between
individuals and dyads and indicated that participants
that were trained and tested in dyads learned to make
judgments more accurately than participants that were
trained and tested individually. The ANOVA revealed
significant main effects of training and test conditions
but no significant interaction, suggesting that the
beneficial effect is a simple, additive function both of
training and testing in dyads. In Figure 4 the
participants trained and tested alone had the highest
value of RMSE, while the dyads constructed statistically
as the mean of two individual judgments have a higher
(poorer) RMSE than the condition with both dyad
training and test. The similar magnitude of the RMSE
for participants trained in dyads but tested as
individuals and the statistical dyads suggest that the
individuals tested in pairs were able to reach the baseline predicted by the combination of their individual
performance. Because the best fitting model for dyads
was the exemplar model (Fig. 5), this illustrates the
statistical exemplar pooling effect. The significant main
effect of training in dyads suggests additional benefits
of training together: a synergetic exemplar pooling
effect. An explanation for these results is that in
contrast to previous abstract memory tasks (e. g.,
remembering word lists), this task draws on
remembering in the more meaningful context of
problem solving. Another potential explanation is that
more efficient training allows a shift from cue
abstraction to exemplar memory (Logan, 1988).
Performance was different in dyads and individuals,
but we were unable to detect any clear differences in
the representations or processes. Our results suggest
that when co-operating in dyads in a task of the sort
addressed here we store more exemplars in memory
leading to a more efficient exploitation of memory with
exemplar-processes dominating the judgments. Another
possibility is that the communication between members
of a dyad makes them work with every exemplar more
carefully, resulting in a better storage of exemplars.
