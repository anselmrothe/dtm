  Hypothesis The hypothesis tested was that productive
failure will be more effective than direct instruction in
learning the concept of variance. That is, expecting to
replicate earlier work on productive failure (Kapur, 2008,                                                            Cumulative

the nature of problem representations and methods
generated by the students in the PF and DI conditions.
   In the PF condition, groups produced four major and

   Category 1: Central Tendencies. Groups started by using
mean, median, and in some cases, mode for data analysis.
This was not surprising because students had been taught
these concepts in the earlier grades. However, relying on
central tendencies alone, it was not possible to generate a
quantitative index for variance because the problem was
designed in a way to keep the central tendencies invariant.
   Category 2: Qualitative methods. Groups generated
graphical and tabular representations that organized the data
visually and were able to discern which player was more
consistent. The visual representations (see Figure 1)
afforded a qualitative comparative analysis between the                              Frequency of years within
