For the experiment we used an immersive virtual city envi-
ronment presented via a head-mounted display (HMD). In
the learning phase, participants experienced the virtual envi-
ronment by walking through it on an omnidirectional tread-
mill. They only walked the route in one direction. In the
testing phase, participants were teleported to different loca-
tions in the environment, without walking physically. They
were then asked to identify their location and heading and
were instructed to point towards multiple targets on the
route. Pointing order could be either towards their current
location or away from it. Direction biases were examined by
comparing pointing performance for pointing to targets lo-
cated route upwards (to the start) with pointing performance
for targets route downwards (to the end).
