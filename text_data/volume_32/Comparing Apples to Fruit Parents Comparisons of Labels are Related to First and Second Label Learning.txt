   Converging evidence from a variety of tasks supports the
idea that children prefer a single label per object. There is
also a great deal of variability from study to study in the
degree to which children reject second labels. Context
factors shown to influence this bias include: bilingual input
(Au & Glusman, 1990; Davidson & Tell, 2005; Merriman &
