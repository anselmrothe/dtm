Abstract
Young children often find it difficult to learn two labels for a
single object. However, there is a great deal of variability
across studies in children’s bias to reject second labels. In
this study, we investigated three possible factors affecting this
variability including age, task, and parental input in a crosssectional sample of children from 12- to 28-months-old. We
show that children reject second labels differently depending
on their age, task demands, and the amount and type of
parental input. Importantly, there is also a correlation
between the ways in which parent’s use second labels and
children’s acceptance of first and second labels for objects.
These results suggest that both previous experience and the
task at hand determine children’s learning of second labels.
Keywords: Word learning, language acquisition, vocabulary,
parental input

Introduction
Sometime after their first birthday, children begin to add
words to their vocabulary at an increasingly greater rate.
These words almost exclusively share a one-to-one
relationship with object categories. Learning more than one
label for the same object, like “banana” and “fruit”, can be
difficult, especially for younger children (Liittschwager &
Markman, 1994; Markman & Wachtel, 1988). The
propensity to reject second labels can be useful when it
comes to learning a new novel name. For example, when
shown two objects, one familiar and one unfamiliar, and
asked to hand the experimenter a “dax”, children can
correctly choose the unfamiliar object. But, this tendency
can sometimes make it hard to learn certain kinds of words
like adjectives (Hall, Waxman, & Hurwitz, 1993), part
labels (Hansen & Markman, 2009; Saylor, Sabbagh, &
Baldwin, 2002), proper names, (Gelman & Taylor, 1984)
and labels at different levels of specificity (Au & Glusman,
1990).
Converging evidence from a variety of tasks supports the
idea that children prefer a single label per object. There is
also a great deal of variability from study to study in the
degree to which children reject second labels. Context
factors shown to influence this bias include: bilingual input
(Au & Glusman, 1990; Davidson & Tell, 2005; Merriman &
Kutlesic, 1993), pragmatic information (Bloom, 2000; Clark
& Grossman, 1998; Diesendruck & Markson, 2001), and
parts of speech and relationship between words (e.g. part

versus a whole object or level of specificity) (Hall,
Waxman, & Hurwitz, 1993; Saylor, Sabbagh, & Baldwin,
2002; Waxman & Senghas, 1992). All of these influences
have in common that they depend on parental input. In this
study we investigate the impact that the relationships
between these different parental factors and how children
learn second labels. Though attempts have been made to
construct a unified explanation that includes all of these
factors (Hollich et al., 2000), few studies have directly
investigated the interaction between these input factors and
the resulting impact on the learning of second labels.
In this study, we investigate the relationship parent input
and the process of word learning.
Specifically, we
investigated the link between second label learning and the
context in which second labels are learned. Both task
differences and object properties may influence second label
learning. We investigate both context variables in relation
to parent’s use of second labels in a naturalistic task.

Second Label Learning Tasks
In general, tasks used to measure second label learning
can be separated into two groups (see Figure 1). They either
1) directly measure the child’s ability to learn two labels for
one object or they 2) require the child to infer by exclusion
to which object a second label applies. This difference in
task is often confounded with age such that older children
do better than younger children when learning by exclusion
(Markman, Wasow, & Hansen, 2003).
In direct learning, children are presented with a familiar
object (e.g. a ball) and told that it is a “dax”. They are then
asked to identify the “dax” among one or more distractors.
In this way, children are required to directly map the word

1356

“dax” to an object (Liittschwager & Markman, 1994;
Mervis, Golinkoff, & Bertrand, 1994). Tasks requiring
learning by exclusion, on the other hand, require that
children infer the referent of a second label. For example,
children may be shown two objects – one that they already
have a name for and one that is unfamiliar. They are then
simply asked to choose the “dax”. Experimenters never
directly label the unfamiliar object as “dax”. Thus, children
must infer that the novel word should refer to the unfamiliar
object (Hollich et al., 2000; Markman, Wasow, & Hansen,
2003).

Parental Input
Several papers have also suggested that parental input
influences second label learning. This is based on studies
showing that parents differ in the amount and type of second
labels they use for different age groups. This difference is
related to vocabulary size (Callanan & Sabbagh, 2004;
Masur, 1997). This conjecture is reasonable given that
parental input effects language development in several ways
(Girolametto, Weitzman, Wiigs, & Pearce, 1999; Hoff &
Naigles, 2002; Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Cymerman, &
Levine, 2002). The drawback to studies showing a
difference in parent input is that they do not investigate the
subsequent impact on children’s biases. Furthermore, these
studies have not investigated the interaction between
amount and type of parental input and the type of task used
to test children’s second label learning. Different types of
input may affect first and second label learning differently
and may interact with task.
In this study, we investigate the amount and type of
second labels that parents use and any to second label
learning across age. Five age groups, from 12- to 28months, were tested on their ability to learn first and second
labels directly and by exclusion. These same children were
also videotaped playing with one of their parents. This
allowed us to not only determine the amount and type of
second label use by parents but look at the interaction
between parental input and task type.

Method
Participants
One-hundred and twenty child-parent dyads were recruited
for the study, including 24 dyads per each of five age
groups, included 12-, 16-, 20-, 24, and 28-month-olds.
Equal numbers of males and females were included and
were distributed approximately equally across age groups.

in two different sessions. The two tasks were always
completed in the same order at each session. Tasks are
described separately below.
Label Learning Task Children were taught four new
labels (e.g. “lep”) for four new objects, counterbalanced
across two sessions. At one session they were taught two
new labels for two familiar objects (i.e. a ball and a spoon).
At the second session they were taught two different new
labels for two unfamiliar objects (i.e. a rubber pot holder
and a honey dipper). At each session, during training
children saw eight objects in the following order: three
objects that weren’t labeled, one object that was labeled
with a first new label, three more objects that weren’t
labeled, and a final object that was labeled with a second
new label.
Children were then tested on six types of trials. The first
two trial types were control trials: 1) known label trials
where they were asked to pick an object they knew (e.g.
doll) from two familiar objects and 2) no label trials where
they were asked to “pick one” of two objects – one target
and one non-target object. The remaining four trials tested
3) first labels (unfamiliar objects) directly and 4) by
exclusion and tested 5) second labels (familiar objects)
directly and 6) by exclusion (see Figure 2). The direct
learning questions tested children’s abilities to learn new
words for objects where the new word was either a second
label for a familiar object (i.e. ball) or a first label for an
unfamiliar object (i.e. pot holder). Learning by exclusion
trials were similar to the direct trials except that children
were now asked to identify a “toma”, a fifth new word that
they had not heard in training, such that the unlabeled
distractors from training now became the target objects.
Input Task This task consisted of a simple play session
in which children and one of their parents (the primary
caregiver when possible) played with four separate sets of
toys for four minutes each. They played with two sets
during one session and the other two sets at a second
session, counterbalanced within and across sessions. The
four sets included a sea animals set, a construction vehicles
set, a fruit and vegetables set, and a kitchen utensils set.
Each set consisted of 14 objects including 12 objects from
the relevant category (roughly half familiar and half
unfamiliar to the 20-month-olds according to MCDI
percentages), one thematically related object, and one
taxonomically related object. For example, the fruits and

Materials
Parents completed a vocabulary checklist of words their
child says using the MacArthur Communicative
Development Inventories (MCDI) (Fenson et al., 1994).
Total vocabulary size was determined using the number of
items that parents indicated their child knew. In addition,
parents and children completed two tasks twice, once each

1357

Results
vegetables set included 12 related food toys (an orange, an
apple, a banana, asparagus, a bean, an onion, a tomato, a
slice of watermelon, a radish, an eggplant, a carrot, and a
pepper), one thematic toy (a cutting board), and one
taxonomic toy (an egg). Parents were told to sit on a large
floor mat and play with their children as if they were at
home. Audio and video was recorded.

Procedure
Parent/child dyads attended two sessions within two weeks
of each other. Parents completed the MCDI vocabulary
checklist on or close to the first session. At each session,
the dyads completed the input task first and the label
learning task second. Parents did not participate, but were
present, for the label learning task.

Coding
Following data collection, all videos of child-parent dyads
were reviewed. Coding of the videos consisted of two
phases; one to identify instances of labeling and one to
identify the types of relations used between first and second
labels.
Label Identification First, all instances of the parent
labeling an object were identified. Children’s labeling
instances were not considered. Specifically, the number of
times that parents labeled the object was recorded separately
for each different label used for each object. For example, a
parent might label the orange object “orange” twice and
“ball” three times. Four separate measures were calculated
using this information including: 1) the proportion of
objects that were labeled, 2) the proportion of labeled
objects that were given two or more labels, 3) the number of
times an object was labeled, and 4) the proportion of
labeling instances that were applied to objects given two or
more labels. Each measure was calculated separately for
familiar and unfamiliar objects, giving us a total of eight
input measures. Familiarity was determined separately for
each child based on parent report.
Second Label Relations After all instances of second
labeling had been identified, the videos were reviewed a
second time and the relationship between each label pair
was coded into one of eight categories: 1) no relation or
labels separated in time (NR), 2) parent indicated that one
label was “not” correct (NT), 3) parents stated that one label
was not correct but that the object looked like another object
(LK), 4) parent used one label as a proper name and one as a
common name (PP), 5) parent used one label as a shortened
version of the other (e.g. “crab” and “crabby”) (SV), 6)
parent stated that an object could be named using one label
“or” another label (OR), 7) parent indicated that they didn’t
know which of two labels were correct (DK), and 8) parent
stated that an object could be named using one label “and”
another label (AND).

Vocabulary
Both children’s total vocabulary and their knowledge of the
56 items in the play sets was assessed using parental report.
Overall, although children’s total vocabulary scores did
increase with age, F(4,115)=92.94, p<.001, their average
vocabulary percentile rank did not, F(4,115)=1.21, p=.31.
On average, children knew 23.65 (SD=12.42) of the 56 test
objects. This average increased with age, F(4,115)=25.24,
p<.001.

Label Learning Task
For each of the six trial types, the average number of times
that each child chose the target object was recorded. The
known and no label trials were analyzed separately from the
four label learning trials.
Known and No Label Trials An analysis of the known
label trials showed that overall children were able to
correctly identify the known objects above chance,
t(113)=21.45, p<.001, with older children doing better,
F(4,109)=11.94, p<.001. In addition, all five age groups
separately identified the target object greater than chance,
all p’s<.05. A similar analysis of the no label trials showed
that, overall, children continued to choose the target object
greater than chance, t(119)=3.44, p<.01. This did not vary
by age, F(4,115)=.80, p=.53.
Label Learning Trials An initial 2 (learning type: direct
or by exclusion) x 2 (label type: first or second labels) x 5
(age group) was conducted (see Table 1 for means and
comparisons to chance). Results showed a main effect of
age, F(1,115)=25.52,p<.001, such that older age groups
learned labels more easily. A main effect of label type,
F(4,115)=16.05,p<.001, showed that children learned first
labels better than second labels overall. This interacted with
learning type, F(4,115)=4.81,p<.01, such that this difference
was greater when children had to learn labels by exclusion
rather than by direct means. Finally, a significant 3-way
interaction suggested that the greater difference between
first and second label learning for exclusion than by direct

means was more pronounced for older than younger kids
and somewhat reversed for 20-month-olds. No other main
effects or interactions were significant.
Correlations Correlation analyses showed a significant
correlation between learning a first label directly and age,
r(120)=.22, p<.05, and a marginal correlation between
learning a second label directly and age, r(120)=.16, p=.08.
No correlations for leaning by exclusion were found.

Input Task
A series of one-way ANOVAs with age group as a betweensubjects factor were conducted on each of the eight input
measures. Results showed that all eight measures changed
with age, all p’s<.05, with the exception of the proportion of
unfamiliar objects labeled (See table 2 for means and SDs),
p>.05. A series of correlations were also computed for each
of the eight measures with age and vocabulary. Age was
correlated with all eight measure, all p’s<.05, with the
exception of the proportion of unfamiliar objects labeled,
p>.05. Vocabulary was correlated with all measures except
for the proportion of familiar and unfamiliar objects labeled,
p>.05.
Generally speaking, the percent of familiar objects
named, but not unfamiliar objects named, increased with
age. The percent of both familiar and unfamiliar labeled
objects that were given two or more labels also increased
with age. The total number of labels used for familiar
objects increased with age, whereas the total number of
labels used for unfamiliar objects decreased. Finally, the
percent of labeling instances that were second labels
increased for both familiar and unfamiliar objects.
Factor Analysis on Relations between Labels A series
of one-way ANOVAs with age were also conducted on the
percentage of each of the eight label relations (NT, NR,
etc…) used of the total relations used per participant. None
of these types of relations changed with age, all F<.01, with
the exception of the PP code, which decreased with age,
F(4,115)=3.92, p<.01. Only one relationship type, NT, was
correlated with age and vocabulary, r(120)=.19, p<.05 and
r(120)=.18, p<.05, respectively.
Because it was likely that the seven codes in which
parents provided relations for two or more labels (all but the
NR code) were heavily interrelated, a factor analysis was
conducted using PCA (principal components analysis) to
look for relation types that loaded onto similar factors or
components. The factor analysis passed several common

criteria for use. First, with over 17 cases per factor, the
factor analysis was reliable. Second, the Kaiser-MeyerOlkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was .53,
above the cutoff of .5. Third, Bartlett’s test of sphericity was
significant, χ2(21)=46.28, p<.01. Finally, the diagonals of
the anti-image matrix and the commonalities between the
relations were all at or above .5.
The principal components analysis produced three
components with Eigen values above 1.0 that were retained
in the model. The first component explained 23.79% of the
variance, the second 17.30%, and the third 14.77%, for a
total variance explained of 55.85%. Four other components
had Eigen values less than 1.0 and were excluded from the
model. Rotation of the solution was utilized to facilitate
interpretation of the three components. For this rotation, the
verimax solution was used, though no difference in
interpretation was obtained using an oblimin solution. None
of the relation types were eliminated from the analysis as all
seven had loadings or cross-loadings of .6 or higher on one
of the three components (see Table 3).
Upon inspection, using values at or greater than .6, it was
clear that the first component (henceforth called Contrast
Relations) represented greater use of the NT and LK
relations as opposed to the AND relation. A higher score on
this component is consistent with input that rejects second
labels while a lower score is consistent with acceptance of
second labels. The DK and OR codes loaded onto the
second component (called Ambivalent Relations) with a
higher score indicating a greater use of relations that are
ambivalent towards rejecting or accepting second labels.
The PP and SV codes loaded onto the third component
(called Elaborative Relations) with a higher score indicated
a greater use of relations in which one label is an elaboration

that adding age and vocabulary to the model did not change
the qualitative conclusions except that a fourth component
reached an Eigen value above 1.0 on which age and
vocabulary, but none of the relations, loaded. Further
analyses showed that none of these three components were
significantly different by age group, nor were they
correlated with age or vocabulary, all p’s>.05.

Relationship between Tasks
In order to evaluate any relationship between the input
task and language learning task, a series of correlations were
computed between the four language learning measures, the
eight measures of label use by parents in the input task, and
the three components identified for the label type relations.
Label Use and Label Learning The number of times that
parents labeled unfamiliar objects was negatively correlated
with children’s ability to learn first labels directly, r(120)=
-.22, p<.05, whereas the ability to learn first labels by
exclusion was positively correlated with the proportion of
unfamiliar objects given two or more labels, r(120)=.19,
p<.05.The ability to learn second labels directly was
negatively correlated with the number of times that parents
labeled unfamiliar objects, r(120)=-.22, p<.05. None of the
input measures were related to second label learning by
exclusion.
If the two second label learning measures are pooled
together to get an overall measure of second label learning,
there is a significant negative correlation with the number of
labels used for unfamiliar objects, r(120)=-.16, p<.05, and a
positive correlation with the proportion of familiar objects
given two or more labels, r(120)=.16, p<.05.
Multiple-labels Relations and Label Learning Parents
use of contrast relations, the first component, was positively
correlated with the ability to learn second labels by
exclusion, r(120)=.19, p<.05, such that the more likely
parents were to state that one label was correct and one was
not, the more likely children were to learn second labels by
exclusion. The second component, ambivalent relations,
was negatively correlated with direct learning of second
labels, r(120)=-.18, p=.05), such that the more ambivalent
relations that parents use, the less likely children were to
learn second labels directly. Finally, the elaborative
relations component was related to the learning of first
labels. It was positively correlated with learning by
exclusion, r(120)=.15, p=.10, and negatively correlated with
direct learning, r(120)=-.25, p<.01.

Discussion
At the outset of this paper, we asked whether parent use of
second labels was related to second label learning. Several
interesting relationships between parents’ use of second
labels and children’s learning of first and second labels were
found. In particular, parents who labeled unfamiliar objects
more had children who were less likely to learn first labels
directly. This suggests that direct learning of first labels is
hindered by parents labeling unfamiliar objects. On the

other hand, parents who gave unfamiliar objects two or
more labels, had children that learned first labels by
exclusion more easily. This suggests that while labeling
unfamiliar objects in general disrupts first label learning, if
those same unfamiliar objects are given more than one label,
it helps children make inferences about first labels. In
addition, the more likely parents were to give two or more
labels to familiar objects, the easier it was for children to
learn second labels (either directly or by exclusion),
providing some evidence for a link between amount of
second label use by parents and second label learning in
children.
Further support for this relationship was found when
looking at the types of relations that parents used to connect
multiple labels. Parents who use less elaborative relations
have children who learn first labels easier when learning is
direct, possibly because input is less muddled. However,
more elaborative relations are associated with better
learning by exclusion, possibly because they support more
complex language relations. Additionally, children learned
second labels directly when input relations were less
ambivalent. This relationship seems, intuitively, to suggest
that using ambivalent relations such as stating that you don’t
know which label is correct hinders second label learning by
direct means. On the other hand, parents who made clear
contrasts between the two labels, stating that one of the two
labels was correct and the other not, had children who found
it easier to learn second labels by exclusion. Though this
may seem unintuitive at first glance, it can be explained by
thinking of learning labels by exclusion as needing to
clearly understand which object should not have a new
label. Parental input that rejects one label in favor of
another helps children do the same when they reject a new
label for an already familiar object in favor of an unfamiliar
object.
Overall, these results suggest that learning both first and
second labels is related to the contrasts that parents make
between labels. First labels are easier to learn directly when
the input is simple and less ambivalent, but easier to learn
by inference with complex input. Second labels are easier
to learn either directly or by exclusion when input is heavy
on clear, less ambivalent, contrasts between labels.
In addition to the relationship between input and second
label learning, we were also able to characterize both the
input and the process of second label learning separately.
First, in regards to second label learning, children easily
learned first labels regardless of whether learning was direct
or by exclusion. However, they had a much more difficult
time when learning second labels by exclusion than by
direct means, and this difference was greater as children got
older. In other words, children rejected second labels more
as they got older, which is consistent with previous
literature (Merriman, Bowman, & MacWhinney, 1989).
Second, we asked whether the amount and type of
parental input in regards to second labels varies and whether
this was related to age. Parents gave both familiar and
unfamiliar objects a higher percentage of second labels as

1360

children got older. In addition, a higher percentage of labels
were used as a second label as children got older. More
interesting, however, is the finding that, although the
percent of second labeling changed with age, the types of
relations that parents made between the two labels did not.
Together these results suggest that the manner in which
parents label objects, not merely the amount, is related to
children’s processing of words. In particular, the types of
contrasts that parents make can support or hurt children’s
word learning. However, it is not the case that providing
children with more label contrasts will boost their word
learning skills. Rather, whether elaborative contrasts with
similar words or concrete contrasts of different words are
better depends on the status of the word as a first or second
label and the task demands.
In sum, not only does input relate to overall language
variables such as vocabulary size, but it is also related to the
way that children process language when presented with a
new word.
Several contextual influences, including
previous experience, task and label type work together to
determine children’s responses at a given moment. More
generally, these results suggest that parental input influences
language biases in highly complex ways, something that
should be carefully controlled and accounted for in future
studies on linguistic biases.
