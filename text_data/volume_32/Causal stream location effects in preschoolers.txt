                               Abstract
   Based on the predictions of a computational model, we test
   preschoolers’ ability to reason about stream location effects:
   reasoning that interventions that occur on a common part of
   a causal process should be more likely to affect multiple rela-
   tions, than interventions which occur on independent parts of
   a causal process. In two experiments, we show that 3- and 4-
   year-olds both show a stream location effect. Children show
   this effect for both familiar and unfamiliar interventions.
