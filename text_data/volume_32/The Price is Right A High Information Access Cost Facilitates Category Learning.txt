people attended to only one of them. The idea of attentional
optimization as a cost-benefit tradeoff explains this result
quite well: the benefit of viewing one feature far outweighs
the cost of accessing it, while the second feature provides no
additional information to offset its access cost and is thus
ignored.
   If attentional optimization is indeed based partially on
cost-benefit considerations, then the degree to which people
optimize their attention should depend on the additional cost
incurred in attending to irrelevant features. A high
information access cost should provide more motivation to
avoid the waste of time or resources associated with
attending to irrelevant information, increasing the rate of
attentional optimization. In contrast, optimizing one’s
attention would provide only a minimal benefit in a
situation in which accessing information is nearly or entirely
free, and as such may be less of a priority for those who are        Figure 1: A sample microorganism stimulus with response
