                           Abstract
   We measure the ability of people to estimate the price
   of familiar household items in a variety of contexts. We
   manipulate whether estimation is done alone or with
   others, whether it is done independently or with the
   knowledge of the estimates of others, and whether it
   is done in a cooperative or competitive environment.
   From these basic estimation data, we construct a series
   of aggregated group estimates, exploring the conditions
   under which a small group of three people provide the
   most accurate information. We compare the performance
   of various small-group estimates to standard Wisdom of
   Crowds analysis, and find that priming people, or placing
   them in a cooperative group setting, is less effective than
   averaging the independent estimates of individuals. We
   also find, however, that it is possible to extract relatively
   more information from the decisions people make in
   a competitive group setting, using cognitive models of
   their decision-making.
