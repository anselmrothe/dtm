Abstract: When producing line drawings of common objects with an intrinsic front, directional biases are observed
in starting location, stroke direction, and figure orientation, Previous studies of drawing directionality have predom-
inantly examined right handers and/or have considered dominant hand drawing performance only. By contrast, the
present study compared drawing directionality of right vs. left handers drawing objects with their dominant and
non-dominant hands. Object facing direction was found to differ significantly as a function of handedness and hand
used. Whereas right handersâ€™ orientation preference was generally unaffected by hand used to draw, left handers
tended to show a stronger right-facing bias when drawing with their left hand than when drawing with their right
hand. The latter finding is consistent with a biomechanical account in terms of hand movement asymmetries. Ad-
ditional accounts of drawing asymmetries are addressed and their implications explored for current views on the
relationship between perception, cognition, and action.
