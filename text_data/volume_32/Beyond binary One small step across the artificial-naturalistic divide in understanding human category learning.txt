Abstract: The foundational six types problem (Shepard, Hovland, & Jenkins, 1961) offers a limited view of human
category learning due to minimal ecological validity. The SHJ types actually do address the explanatory constructs
historically proposed to explain natural categories (rules, exemplars, family resemblance), but do so in an impover-
ished manner due to binary-valued dimensions. We studied the SHJ types using stimuli with four values on each
dimension. The SHJ types become more like natural concepts with more robust intension (internal structure) and
extension (category size). This allows for richer evaluation of the representations and processes underlying learner
performance. Results depart from the traditional ease of learning order (I&gt;II&gt;III,IV,V&gt;VI) since Type
IV (family resemblance structure) shows higher accuracy than Type II early in learning. Transfer to novel items
and typicality ratings reveal graded structure even in rule-described categories and show distinct signatures of the
categorization basis used by each learner.
