indicated that overall memory accuracy was lower in 3-

importantly however, there was no effect of condition and
no age-by-condition interaction, both Fs < 1, ns. Therefore,
results of the memory check indicate that if any significant
differences in object tracking accuracy are observed
between the All Same and the All Different Distracters
conditions, these differences are unlikely to stem from
differential demands on working memory.                                  Figure 2. Tracking accuracy scores in Experiment 1.
