This will be particularly important with regard to X4, where
we can explore how an increase in the exposure to the one
context for X4 (and potentially a perceived increase also in
the gaps at the non-occurring contexts for X4) affects how
learners generalize their knowledge of the category X1- X3.
If the category X1- X3 is strongly defined (as in Experiment
1), we would expect that a very large increase in frequency
of the one context of X4 (and perceived increase in exposure
to gaps for X4) might be required before there is a decrease
in generalization and a lessening of X4 membership in the
X-word category. However, if the X-category is weakly
defined as in Experiment 3, the small increase in the number
of repetitions in Experiment 4 might be enough to make
learners conservative in their generalizations.                        Figure 1: Experiment 1-4 difference scores of ratings of
