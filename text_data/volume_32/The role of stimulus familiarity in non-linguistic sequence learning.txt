Abstract: Recent experiments suggest that the mechanisms employed in language learning are also involved in
sequential learning of non-linguistic stimuli and are therefore domain-general. However, the non-linguistic materials
typically used in these experiments (e.g. Kirkham, Slemmer & Johnson, 2002) do not adequately replicate the internal
complexity of words in language. Furthermore, stimulus familiarity appears to play a crucial role (Saffran, 2007).
We explore both factors, investigating the acquisition of non-adjacencies (ubiquitous in language) in non-linguistic
sequences. Crucially, the black and white matrix patterns we use are orthographically matched with an artificial
language, replicating the componential re-use of elements in language or speech (Sturm & Smith, 2009). Prior to
the sequence learning experiment, participants were familiarized with individual patterns. The results show that
although participants became familiarized with the patterns, they were unable to identify the grammar underlying
sequences of those patterns. These findings allude to an important role of domain-specific expectations.
