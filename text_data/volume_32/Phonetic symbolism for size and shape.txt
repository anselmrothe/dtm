Abstract: Many previous studies of phonetic symbolism, wherein the sounds of a word convey the referentâ€™s
attributes, have confounded multiple attributes such as size and shape. In the current study, participants viewed
novel objects of varying size and shape and were asked to rate the appropriateness of a spoken non-word as a name
for the object. Size and shape interacted (e.g., higher ratings were given for names with front vowels like /i/ when
the object was small and spiky), and both spiky and round objects were phonetically marked. However, participants
tended to use phonemes to mark size only when the object is large. This suggests that marking via phonemes should
not be assumed to simultaneously mark all physical properties of the object (i.e., both size and shape). Consequently,
phonetic symbolism of physical properties may not correlate as neatly with gesture as has previously been thought.
