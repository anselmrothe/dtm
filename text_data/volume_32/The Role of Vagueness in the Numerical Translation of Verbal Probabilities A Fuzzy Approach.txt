presented words. The minimal and maximal estimates, that
indicate the borders of the semantic meaning of the
linguistic terms, were necessary for modelling the MFs.
   Results show that the probability words are distributed all
over the numerical probability scale with varying distances.
The standard deviation and kurtosis show a systematic
pattern: probability words near to the borders of the
numerical probability scale (e.g. impossible and certain)
have small standard deviations but high values of kurtosis.
And probability words in the middle (e.g. thinkable and
possible) offer a larger spread but smaller kurtosis values.
Also systematic differences exist for the skew indicating
that probability expressions with means smaller than P=0.5
are skewed to the right whereas words with means higher
than P=0.5 are asymmetric to the left. These findings are               Figure 2: Membership functions of the 13 verbal

   Large overlaps of the functions (see Figure 2) indicate
