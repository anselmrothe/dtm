Clore, & Collins, 1988; Russell, 2003; Stein & Levine,
1991). While these theories convey general links between
cognition and emotions, they do not directly explain and
predict the sort of emotions that occur during complex
learning, such as attempts to master physics, biology, or
computer literacy. Researchers in many different fields are
familiar with Ekman’s work on the detection of emotions
from facial expressions (Ekman, 1984). However, the
emotions that Ekman intensely investigated (e.g., sadness,
happiness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise) have minimal
relevance to learning in typical academic settings (D'Mello,
