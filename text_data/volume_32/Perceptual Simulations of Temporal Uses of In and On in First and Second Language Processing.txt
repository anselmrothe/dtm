   To summarize, the main goal of Experiments 1 and 2 was
to investigate the influence of language on the activation of
image schematic perceptual simulations. Perceptual
simulation was operationally defined as the process of
selecting a visually presented object, a calendar, congruent
with a conventionally accepted response to a target question
(date or month of birth). There were two experimental
