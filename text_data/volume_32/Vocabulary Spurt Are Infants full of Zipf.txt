Abstract

1993), word retrieval capacities (Dapretto & Bjork, 2000),
improvements in social cognition (Ninio, 1995) or changes in
hemispheric specialisation (Mills, Coffey-Corina, & Neville,
1993). All of these hypotheses share the assumption that the
vocabulary spurt reflects endogenous changes in the infant.
A second, contrasting, hypothesis has recently been introduced by McMurray (2007). He argued that under the reasonable assumptions that (i) words are learnt in parallel and
(ii) some words are easier to learn than most words, a vocabulary spurt is inevitable and that “this distribution in difficulty derives from many factors, including frequency, phonology, syntax, the child’s capabilities, and the contexts where
words appear.”(McMurray, 2007, p.631). Invoking the central limit theorem, he suggested that the individual contributions of the different factors sum to a Gaussian distribution of
word difficulty. Later, using the logarithm of utterance statistics as a proxy for word difficulty, he showed that a time-toacquisition growth curve yields a pattern of vocabulary development typical of infants during their second year. On
the basis of this finding, he claimed that “acceleration in vocabulary growth could arise from occurrence statistics alone”
(McMurray, 2007, p.631).
Our aim is to clarify the origin of this non-linear increase
in the speed of lexical acquisition; whether this transition is
the result of a change in the infant’s mental representations or
brain organisation (endogenous factors), or caused by the statistical nature of the input, such as phonological complexity
or the frequency of word usage (exogenous factors). We show
mathematically that word frequency cannot alone explain the
acceleration in vocabulary growth. This demonstration also
fits well with empirical findings that word frequency is not
an entirely reliable proxy for word difficulty (Huttenlocher,
1991; Goodman, Dale, & Li, 2008). Instead, we suggest that
changes in the infant’s learning capacity are required to display the non-linear growth in the speed of word acquisition.
These changes, such as the emergence of fast mapping (Carey
& Bartlett, 1978), provide the basis for the unique learning
capacities displayed late in the second year of human life.

Infants do not learn words at a constant rate. During the
second year of life, a dramatic increase in the speed of
word learning is observed. Different mechanisms explaining
this vocabulary spurt have been proposed, either through
endogenous factors such as learning capacity or exogenous
factors, such as frequency of word usage. We demonstrate
that occurrence statistics alone is not sufficient to explain the
acceleration in vocabulary growth, discuss other potential
exogenous contributions such as phonological complexity and
suggest that a change in word learning capacities is necessary.
A model implementing an increased ease of learning is introduced and illustrates this endogenous approach by replicating
the non-linear vocabulary growth characteristics of language
acquisition.

Introduction
Around their first birthday infants utter their first word and by
their second birthday they learn on average one new word every waking hour. Between 18 and 24 months of age, an abrupt
change in the speed of word acquisition is observed, called
the vocabulary spurt or naming explosion (Bloom, 1973)1 .
Two types of theories have been offered to explain the vocabulary spurt. One suggests that the vocabulary spurt corresponds to representational and/or maturational changes in
the infant’s brain. For example, researchers have suggested
that infants start acquiring words at a faster pace when they
understand that words refer to things and/or that things have
names. On this view, the vocabulary spurt corresponds to
a naming insight (Dore, Franklin, Miller, & Ramer, 1976;
Reznick & Goldfield, 1992; McShane, 1979; Kamhi, 1986).
Alternatively, word learning occurs at a faster pace when
object concepts and categories become more detailed and
refined (Bates, Benigni, Bretherton, Camaioni, & Volterra,
1979; Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1987; Nazzi & Bertoncini, 2003).
Other researchers have proposed that the spurt corresponds to
linguistic refinements such as word segmentation (Plunkett,
1 We will use the terminology “vocabulary spurt” throughout the
manuscript in the sense of a supra-linear lexical growth, characterised by slow learning in early development, followed by an increase in the speed of word learning later on. Even though an increase in the speed of word learning in the first years of human life
is not questioned, its mathematical description is debated; should
it possess a clear inflection point or is there a more gradual increase throughout early development, as suggested by Ganger and
Brent (2004)? For the scope of the present manuscript, we use the
term “vocabulary spurt” in its general – and milder – interpretation,
whereby infants display slow initial learning followed by a faster
rate of word learning, contrasting with a linear increase in which the
rate of word learning would be constant during life.

Statement of the problem
For expository purposes, we make three simplifying assumptions; (i) infants only learn words when hearing them, (ii)
word occurrence statistics follows Zipf’s law and (iii) all
words are equally difficult to learn. If these three criteria are
satisfied, we demonstrate that vocabulary growth will be linear, unless a change in learning capacity takes place (as a
function of time or as a function of the number of words al-

836

ready present in the lexicon2 ). In other words, a change in
learning capacity is a necessary pre-requisite to drive a nonlinearity in vocabulary growth. We justify this claim by both
analytical considerations and through simulations. Later, we
will show that (i) the assumption of online learning can be
relaxed, (ii) that speech corpora used with real infants follow
the same behaviour as Zipf’s law and we will suggest that
(iii) phonological complexity of early words do not seem to
play a prominent role in shaping the vocabulary spurt. We
will suggest, therefore, that a change in the infants’ learning
capacities is driving the naming explosion.
Let us first justify our initial assumptions. First, we argue
that infants learn words when they are confronted with them
and not by processing words off-line after accumulating evidence. Carey and Bartlett (1978) introduced the idea that
infants are able to “fast map”, whereby infants demonstrate
rapid mastery of the appropriate use of labels after a limited
number of learning opportunities. Evidence of the infant’s
ability to learn a new word after limited exposure was also
explored by Woodward, Markman, and Fitzsimmons (1994),
suggesting that novel words can be retained at least 24 hours
after the infants have been exposed to them only 9 times,
even for infants as young as 13 months of age. More recent
evidence based on infant-caregiver interactions showed that
the naming event needs to occur at the right moment in time
when the infant is attending to the named object to be successful (Yu, Smith, & Pereira, 2008)3 . These findings provide
strong support for the claim that infants perform on-line word
learning when exposed to them. Consequently, if infants only
engage in online word learning, the raw statistics of word usage should be exploited and not, as in McMurray (2007), a
logarithmic transformation of the word frequencies (a further
comparison of our approach to McMurray, 2007, is discussed
later). Moreover, we will show that even a relaxation of the
assumption of online learning cannot explain an accelerated
vocabulary growth.
Second, we adopt the perspective that infants are exposed
to a distribution of word frequencies approaching Zipf’s law
(Zipf, 1949), which states that, from any substantial corpus,
the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank.
For example, the most frequent word is used twice as much
as the second most frequent word and three times more often than the third most frequent word. A broad range of evidence suggests that spoken language essentially follows a
Zipf distribution of word usage (Miller & Chomsky, 1963;
Zipf, 1935; Beier, 1965; Dahl, 1979; Altmann, 2002). We
will show, in a model with constant learning capacity and exposed to a corpus of speech used with real infants, that lexical growth fails to exhibit the characteristics of a vocabulary

spurt, even when the utterance statistics deviate slightly from
Zipf’s law.

Analytical considerations
On average, an infant hears a word i having a frequency f (i)
within a time window t(i) = 1/ f (i). For example, a word
uttered twice an hour will be heard on average every 30 minutes and a word uttered 4 times a month will be uttered every
week or so. As a consequence, and to a first approximation,
the time T (i) to acquire a word i is inversely proportional to
its frequency T (i) ∝ 1/ f (i). The constant of proportionality
depends on the number of times a word needs to be heard
with respect to the threshold for learning it. Zipf’s law states
that, from any substantial corpus, the frequency of a word is
inversely proportional to its rank: f (i) ∝ 1/i. This predicts
a linear distribution of time to acquisition; T (i) ∝ i, which in
turn predicts a linear increase in the size of the lexicon. The
(constant) speed at which infants increment their lexicon size
would then be proportional to their (fixed) learning capacity,
as defined by the number of times they need to hear a word
in order to add it to their lexicon. In real word learning situations, words do not follow Zipf’s law deterministically. However, the fluctuations in everyday interactions can be modelled by drawing words probabilistically from Zipf’s distribution. Since analytical calculations become increasingly complex, we simulate this process in a stochastic model.

Simulation results
Fig. 1 displays simulations using raw frequencies of word
usage from Zipf’s distribution. As in McMurray (2007), a
knowledge level is associated with each word and is incremented with each presentation. When this crosses a threshold, the word is learnt. The model reveals a regular increase
of word acquisition, the absence of an early, slow learning
phase and no inflection point in word learning; in other words,
the absence of a vocabulary spurt. The different curves on

and McMurray (2009) have shown that leveraged
learning—the fact that knowledge of some words helps with the
learning of others—does not create acceleration in word learning.
3 In a recent experiment, Smith and Yu (2008) showed that infants
were able to use cross-situational statistics to learn novel words. It
remains to be shown, however, if these effects extend to longer time
windows than used in the experiment, consisting of multiple presentations of each word-referent pair over the course of 4 minutes.

Fig. 1 correspond to different (constant) learning capacities,
i.e., the number of presentations needed to acquire the word
in the lexicon. Steeper curves correspond to better learning
capacities. Note that, in the model, the absolute number of
words uttered in an epoch of exposure also modulates the
slope of the learning curves. Similar curves may correspond
either to a proficient learner confronted to a low number of
words or to a slower learner presented with a higher number
of words in any time window. All combinations of learning
capacities and absolute number of words uttered per epoch
lead to linear increases in the lexicon size.
As a further control we ran simulations with actual word
frequencies extracted from the CHILDES Parental Corpus,
made out of the following 27 corpora; Bates, Belfast,
Bernstei, Bliss, Bloom, Brown, Clark, Cornell, Demetras,
Fletcher, Gatherco, Hall, Higginso, Howe, Kuczaj, Macboys
(MacWhinney), Macros (MacWhinney), Peters, Post, Sachs,
Snow, Suppes, Valian, Vanhout, Vankleec, Warren, and
Wells. The Parental Corpus consists of 2.6 million word tokens (about 24,000 word types), and is a representative sample of the speech to which children are typically exposed
(MacWhinney, 1991; Li & Shirai, 2000). Fig. 2 shows that for
differing numbers of presentations needed to acquire a word
(different learning capacities), vocabulary growth lacks both
the long latent period of slow learning and subsequent rapid
increase characteristics of the vocabulary spurt. Instead, the
speed of acquisition is reduced after having learnt about 100
words, and converges to a constant rate of acquisition thereafter. The number of epochs used in this simulation is greater
due to the large size of the corpus. We conclude that word

that a change in learning capacity is required in order to display an accelerated increase in word learning.

Relaxation of the assumption of ‘online’ learning
We have demonstrated that an acceleration in vocabulary
growth cannot be expected when presented with word distributions following Zipf’s law, unless a change in learning
capacity is implemented in the model or further variations in
word difficulties are present. We have also shown that when
the occurrence statistics deviates moderately from Zipf’s law,
as exemplified through simulations using the Parental Corpus,
a vocabulary spurt is still absent in the model. We now show
that the assumption of online learning can also be relaxed.
Let assume that upon presentation of a word, a ‘memory
trace’ is initiated. This memory trace would modulate over
time the value of the knowledge variable associated with that
given word. Let us discuss the potential behaviour of this
memory trace. We have already discussed the case for which
the memory trace remains constant: It corresponds to the case
in which each presentation of a word leads to an increment
in the knowledge variable associated with that word, until it
crosses a threshold. We have demonstrated earlier that no
acceleration in vocabulary growth is observed unless an improvement of learning capacity is implemented in the model.
Moreover, frequent words are learnt very early on, thereby
failing to reproduce the long latency period observed in early
childhood. Alternatively, the memory trace could increase
over time (Vlach, Sandhofer, & Kornell, 2008), mimicking
consolidation of the word form or meaning during sleep (Dumay & Gaskell, 2007) or through rehearsal of that word.
However, high frequency words would be learnt even more
rapidly under these conditions than with the constant memory
trace, resulting, again, in the absence of the long latency period observed early in life. This account would fail to exhibit
the characteristic contrast observed in infancy between a slow
initial learning followed by an acceleration in lexical growth.
Finally, the memory trace could decay over time, reflecting
the degradation in the representations of words in absence of
a new utterance, as described by Horst and Samuelson (2008).
In this case, low frequency words whose memory trace decays faster than the typical interval between successive word
presentations would never be learnt. Although we do not suggest that no learning take place beyond the actual presentation
of a word, dynamic memory traces associated with individual presentations of the word are not the ingredient needed to
explain the supra-linear vocabulary growth. Decaying memory traces as in Horst and Samuelson (2008) or reinforcement
(Vlach et al., 2008; Dumay & Gaskell, 2007) would merely
modulate the vocabulary spurt, not create this acceleration.

Relationship to McMurray’s account

statistics alone cannot be responsible for the vocabulary spurt
observed at the end of the second year of life. Rather, as many
researchers have suggested, the vocabulary spurt is driven by
underlying changes in learning capacity arising from changes
in mental representations and/or brain organisation. We next
offer a conceptual implementation of this alternative view;

Our approach shares a similar goal to that of McMurray
(2007): understanding the cause of the sudden increase in
the speed of word learning observed during the second half
of the second year of life. However, our approach differs
in some important respects to both the original paper (Mc-

838

Murray, 2007) and subsequent implementations (Mitchell &
McMurray, 2008, 2009). First, if infants only engage in online word learning, the raw statistics of word usage should
be exploited and not, as in McMurray (2007), a logarithmic
transformation of the word frequencies. In addition to a lack
of psychological validity, such a transformation suffers from
mathematical instability: depending of the lexicon size, the
sum of log-frequencies may become negative, and/or words
with a very low usage (frequency smaller than 1 in the timescale used) would have a negative log-frequency, resulting
in negative probability of occurrence. Thus, the vocabulary
spurt described in McMurray (2007) is driven by a distribution of word frequencies that, due to its log-sampling, do not
reflect the true nature of the statistics of word occurrences.
Second, Mitchell and McMurray (2008) introduce a stochastic adaptation of the original model and show that a wide
range of distributions can lead to a spurt-like behaviour. Crucially, Zipf’s law belongs to the class of distributions that do
not lead to a vocabulary spurt.
Finally, Mitchell and McMurray (2009) study leveraged
learning in word learning. They explore different metrics for
relating word difficulty to word frequency. In a first case,
they scale difficulty as an additive function of frequency. In
order to avoid the problem of very high frequency words having negative difficulty values, they add a constant value to the
difficulty score. The second case, in which word difficulty
is scaled to the inverse of frequency is the approach we have
chosen: For example, a word that is heard twice as often is
deemed to be exactly twice as easy to learn. However, words
follow Zipf’s law only at a stochastic level. Our analysis,
beyond initial analytical considerations, provides a stochastic account of word learning, when infants hear words drawn
either from Zipf’s distribution or from a corpus consisting
of speech to which infants are typically exposed. Mitchell
and McMurray (2009) provide a non-stochastic implementation of Zipf’s distribution and Mitchell and McMurray (2008)
provide a stochastic implemetation of non-Zipfian distributions. The critical combination of a Zipfian distribution with
a stochastic implementation is absent from their account.4

a 40,000 word lexicon distributed with Zipf’s law. Words
that were presented on average less than once per day, were
sampled according to their probability of occurrence within
a day. The developmental time course of this probability is
implemented as a non-linear function of time, in order to
mimic the emergence of fast mapping and increased learning capacity, observed during the second year of life. In the
model, the probability of learning a word increases with time;
p(t) = (t/20000)3 . Any non-linear increase in the probability
of learning a word would result in a non-linear developmental
trajectory of word learning. Such a change in the parameters
would only result in a quantitatively different path to word
learning, not a qualitative change6 . Note that this model is
equivalent to a modified version of McMurray’s model, in
which increment size increases with time. From this perspective, many presentations of a word are needed for successful learning early in development whereas later in the second
year, just a single presentation may be sufficient for learning
that word, due to the emergence of fast mapping. Fig. 3 depicts the developmental trajectory simulated with the model.
The curve of vocabulary acquisition possesses a clear nonlinearity separating the early slow learning and the late fast
learning regimes, similar to the naming explosion.

An alternative account
Since a Zipf distribution of word usage is insufficient to capture the vocabulary spurt, we simulate an alternative account
where the capacity of learning a word is not kept constant
during early life. As infants only learn words on the basis
of raw exposure, the model is presented with words drawn
from a Zipf distribution and, for each presentation, the model
has an increasing probability of learning that word. We presented 10,000 words per “day” in the simulation5 , out of

Discussion
Two contrasting hypotheses have been proposed in order to
explain the rapid increase in the speed of word learning occurring in the second year of life. On the one hand, researchers
have argued that the vocabulary spurt is driven by changes
in the infant’s learning capacities, such as the emergence of
a naming insight or via maturational changes in the brain.
We refer to this view as the endogenous hypothesis. In con-

4 “[...] it is important to remember that frequency is not a property
of the word [...], it is an estimate of how often it occurs (stochastically) in the child’s environment. Thus, our model may be limited in
its ability to handle frequency, and a stochastic model may be a better approach for dealing with it (e.g., Mitchell & McMurray, 2008)”
(Mitchell & McMurray, 2009, p.1519)
5 Hart and Risley (1992) reported that, on average, 10- to 18month-old infants hear 1275 words per hour. Assuming that this

level of exposure is maintained for 8 hours per day, then infants hear
about 10,000 words a day.
6 Since in the present simulations we did not simulate the system
for more than 20000 epochs, the probability is always smaller than
1. One could alternatively choose a non-linear function of time that
saturates at 1 (or close to 1) for increasing time, so as to mimic a
smooth and continuous improvement in learning capacities.

839

trast, a second hypothesis highlights environmentally-based
factors that contribute to the difficulty in learning words, such
as frequency, phonological complexity, etc. On this view, the
vocabulary explosion is a by-product of variability in word
difficulty. We refer to this hypothesis as the exogenous hypothesis.
We have argued that simple analytical considerations
demonstrate that a linear increase in the size of the lexicon
is expected when presented with word frequencies distributed
with Zipf’s law. Moreover, simulations with a stochastic sampling of words following Zipf’s law, as well as with samples
of speech to which infants are exposed, confirmed that the
type of distribution of word frequencies found in natural language would fail to induce a naming explosion. Mitchell and
McMurray (2008) have shown that a wide range of mathematical distributions of word difficulties predict a non-linear
growth of the infant lexicon. We have demonstrated that word
occurrences following Zipf’s law and speech typically heard
by infants does not belong to this family of mathematical distributions.7
Since we have demonstrated that word frequency cannot account for the vocabulary spurt, it is reasonable to ask
whether other exogenous factors that influence word difficulty could be the source of the non-linear vocabulary growth.
For example, McMurray (2007) points out that phonological
complexity contributes to word difficulty. It is not straightforward to measure the impact of phonological complexity during early word learning since the basis of infant’s
lexico-phonological representations is not yet well understood. However, as a first approximation, we might consider word length as a proxy for phonological complexity
and hence word difficulty. In a recent review, Juhasz (2005)
identified contributing factors in picture naming tasks. All
reviewed studies (13) showed a correlation between age of
acquisition and latency measures, suggesting that latency in
picture naming tasks is a reliable way of determining when
the word was acquired. In contrast, word length was found to
be a significant variable in only 3 studies, whereas 9 studies found it to be non-significant. Phonological complexity, therefore, like frequency may not be a suitable candidate
for predicting vocabulary acceleration as “an unavoidable byproduct of variation in difficulty”. Whereas many factors can
impact the distribution of difficulty in learning a word, such
as word length or word frequency, it remains to be proven
that they play a primary role in determining the shape of the
vocabulary spurt. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight
that other exogenous factors are likely to contribute to differences in word difficulties. Many researchers would argue that
words are not learnt in isolation, and the context in which they

appear may affect directly the set of potential interpretations
of the words, through referential uncertainty. Computational
models have shown that word learning in a sentential context
can display a spurt-like pattern in the learning curve (Siskind,
1996; Fazly, Alishahi, & Stevenson, 2008) and experimental
studies have shown that context diversity and within-context
ambiguity can override the role of word frequency (Kachergis, Yu, & Shiffrin, 2009). Nevertheless, Hayes and Ahrens
(1988) have shown that there is a positive correlation between
a caregiver’s mean length of utterance and the age of the infant. As a consequence, young infant are exposed frequently
to words in isolation or in short motherese.
We propose, instead, that endogenous factors are primarily
responsible for the vocabulary spurt. Among them, the emergence of fast mapping can explain the increase in the ease of
acquisition late in the second year of life (Carey & Bartlett,
1978). Further evidence for a change in learning capacity is
that word familiarity impacts the distribution of brain regions
involved in word learning, reflecting an increased efficiency
in the manner in which infants process familiar and novel
words across the vocabulary spurt (Mills, Plunkett, Pratt, &
Schafer, 2005). It is, however, important to note that neither maturational changes in the brain, nor the application
of innate or domain-specific constraints are required to explain a change in learning capacity. For example, Mayor and
Plunkett (2008) showed that no specialised mechanisms are
needed to explain the vocabulary spurt, as a simple general
learning mechanism can lead to the spontaneous emergence
of fast mapping. A change in learning capacities, not mechanisms, drives the rapid onset of vocabulary acquisition observed late in the second year of life. Hence, a word that
seems difficult for a 15-month-old may be acquired almost
instantaneously by a 21-month-old. Is the vocabulary spurt
compatible with Zipf’s law? The answer is clearly “yes” provided we allow the listener to develop her learning capacities.

anonymous reviewer pointed out that a caregiver’s word usage may vary over time, despite following Zipf’s law at a global
scale. As a result, fragments of a caregiver’s speech may deviate
from Zipf’s law, resulting in a vocabulary spurt. The analysis of a
biased stochastic sampling of words from a Zipf distribution would
be an interesting avenue for further research. However, a random
sampling from a Zipf distribution failed to display a spurt-like pattern of word learning.
