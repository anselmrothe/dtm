Abstract: This study investigates whether 9-month-olds use action information to make predictions about the
hidden structure of an object. Two groups saw an actor repeatedly raise and lower a box. In one group, the box
was moved with a hidden handle. In the other group, a box with no handle was grasped along the hidden back face
and repeatedly raised and lowered. Following this familiarization, the box was rotated 90 degrees either to reveal a
structure consistent or to reveal a structure inconsistent with that suggested by the initial action. Patterns of looking
between familiarization and test trials differed for the two familiarization groups, suggesting that 9-month-old infants
can infer certain details of an objectâ€™s structure from human action.
