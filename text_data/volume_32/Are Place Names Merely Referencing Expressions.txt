Abstract: Previous research found cross-modality priming for the names of well-known people and landmarks, but
not for nouns or country names (Hollis & Valentine, 2001). Hollis and Valentine argue that country names were
processed like nouns because they have sense (i.e. they can act as adjectives) and are therefore not pure referencing
expressions. However, it could be argued that the participants processed country names like nouns because they
possessed richer knowledge about countries (e.g. culture, climate, political structure) than about landmarks. The
current study used locality names that cannot act as adjectives to test this interpretation. No cross-modality priming
was found for locality names, indicating that they are processed like nouns. One possible interpretation of these
findings is that the richness of the mental representation associated with a given place name determines whether it
will be processed as a noun. c Crown Copyright 2010 Reproduced by permission of Ordnance Survey.
