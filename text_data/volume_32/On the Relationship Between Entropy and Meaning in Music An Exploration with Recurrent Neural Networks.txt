contrapuntal dimensions. A study of entropy as a correlate
of tension should address more than just single melodic lines,
since harmony and counterpoint are critical dimensions along
which music can meaningfully vary.
   The present study investigates the extent to which entropy
can serve as a general measure of tension–and thus meaning–
in music. To that end, I present a recurrent neural network as
a predictive model of polyphonic (multiple-part) music and
compare entropy measures derived from the model with tra-
ditional music theoretical analysis. I show that features of the
traditional analysis related to subjective tension have partic-
ular signatures in the model’s entropy measures, supporting
the hypothesis that entropy underlies musical meaning.
