 Box 1: Simulations.
 The economic (stock market) simulations begin (Frame A) with the 420 agents evenly divided between owning the stock (dark; red in the original simulation)
 and not owning the stock (white). A bar on the right side of the screen indicates the proportion of the agents currently owning the stock. While the simulation is
 running, each agent will buy or sell the stock with some specified probability. In the Positive Feedback version of the simulation, the probability of buying rather
 than selling is a positive function of the overall ownership of the stock. As more agents own the stock, the likelihood of new agents purchasing the stock
 increases. Conversely, as fewer agents own the stock, the likelihood of other agents selling the stock increases. Because of this, random initial fluctuations in
 stock ownership tend to be amplified over time, and the system quickly moves toward the extremes, resulting in either ownership by all agents or ownership by
 no agents (Frame B). In the Negative Feedback version, the probability of an agent buying the stock is a negative function of overall ownership. Therefore,
 increased overall ownership makes agents more likely to sell the stock, while decreased overall ownership makes agents more likely to buy. This tends to create
 homeostasis in the system. As the ownership of the stock begins to increase or decrease, the market quickly “corrects” itself and maintains an even proportion of
 owners and non-owners (as in Frame A).
    In the course of the simulation, students are instructed to force a proportion of the agents to buy or sell the stock. This is accomplished by selecting the
 appropriate button on the left side of the screen, then clicking and dragging across the agents. These interactions serve to highlight the way that the system
 responds to small imbalances, by either amplifying them (positive feedback) or reducing them (negative feedback). Additionally, students are explicitly reminded
 at one point during the simulation that it is an example of a positive or negative feedback system. For instance, those in the Negative Feedback version were told:
 “Observe how this system is a negative feedback loop. People buying the stock leads to other people selling it, and people selling the stock leads to other people
 buying it. This tends to keep the system in balance, without allowing too many people to own or not own the stock at once.”
    The biological (slime mold) simulations begin with 27 agents (mold cells) randomly distributed on the screen. While the simulation is running, each cell
 moves about the screen probabilistically, and secretes a chemical that remains for a short period of time in its current location. In the Positive Feedback version,
 cells are attracted this chemical, and their likelihood of moving toward a location increases with the quantity of the chemical there. Over time, this results in the
 cells grouping into a small number of clusters (Frame C), since more cells in a given location leads to a greater amount of the chemical there, attracting even
 more individuals. (Chemical density is reflected by the brightness of a location). In the Negative Feedback version, cells tend to be repelled by the chemical, and
 are therefore more likely to move to locations where less of the substance is present. This results in the cells attempting to maintain a maximal distance from one
 another, leading to a relatively homogenous distribution across the field (Frame D).
 During the simulation, users are instructed to add additional mold cells to the system, by selecting the “Add slime mold” button and clicking in the desired
 location on the screen. They are asked at various points to observe the relative effects of clustering these new cells close together versus spreading them out in
 the space. They are also reminded at one point that the simulation is an example of positive or negative feedback, and why. For example, users in the Positive
 Feedback version were told: “Observe how this system is a positive feedback loop. Cells produce the chemical in a certain location, which brings other cells to
 that location, which leads to even more of the chemical there. This tends to bring the cells together into large clusters.
