color chips, comprised of 40 equally spaced Munsell hues at 8
levels of lightness and achromatic chips at 10 levels of light-

were asked to name each color chip, and also to point out the
most representative chip for each color term. Later analysis of

Methods
Participants Participants were 390 members of the com-
munity at the University of California, Berkeley, receiving
either course credit or approximately $10/hr for taking part in
the experiment.
Stimuli Each participant learned a system of color terms
by being provided with examples of colors and the terms that
were associated with them, and then generalized those terms
to new colors. The color stimuli were presented on an Ap-
ple iMac computer by a Java program, and the monitor was
calibrated using a ColorVision Spyder2 colorimeter/color cal-
ibrator on regular basis. A total of 330 colors were used as
stimuli, corresponding to the computer screen analogues of
the 330 Munsell color chips used in the WCS. Each term was           Figure 3: Representative examples of the data produced by
