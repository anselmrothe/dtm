Abstract: Verb-body part association data were obtained from 36 adults using English (a second language), and
Telugu and Hindi (as first languages). A set of 100 action verbs in English (same as those used in Maouene et
al, 2008) and their equivalents in Telugu and Hindi served as target stimuli. Three groups of young adults (12 per
language) provided written responses to action verbs printed in each language. There was greater agreement for verbs
involving actions of hand, mouth and leg compared to the other body parts across all three languages. However,
there were some language specific findings with respect to number of unique body parts specified, and the number
of body parts required to cover 80
