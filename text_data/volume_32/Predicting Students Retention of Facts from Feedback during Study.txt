                               Data
Our data are from an unpublished experiment by Pashler,
Mozer, and Wixted (unpublished) in which 56 undergradu-
ates tried to learn the disciplines of 60 relatively obscure No-
bel prize winners. In an initial pass through the material, sub-
jects were shown the names of the prize-winners paired with
their disciplines. Each winner-discipline pair was displayed
for five seconds. For each prize winner’s name, subjects were
given either three or six study opportunities during which they
could guess the discipline. For each guess, they received au-
ditory feedback that signaled whether or not the guess was
correct. If it was incorrect, the correct answer was displayed
on the screen. For these study trials, subjects responded by
pressing one of four keys on a keyboard (the experiment in-
volved only three disciplines, and a fourth key indicated “no
guess”). During study, both the accuracies and latencies of            Figure 1: The grid used by the histogram classifier for
