Abstract: How does visual attention operate in social contexts? Most research exploring this question has used
picture or video paradigms that contain social stimuli but do not provide any opportunity for social interaction with
the participant. In our study, we monitored participants’ eye movements as they sat in a waiting room. Participants
waited while either a confederate quietly completed a questionnaire, or while a video of the same confederate filling
out the questionnaire was displayed on a nearby computer. Participants’ fixation patterns of real vs. videotaped
confederates indicated that participants actively avoided looking at the real person, while they looked more and
for longer at the videotaped confederate. These results demonstrate the importance of social presence on visual
attention and suggest that video- or picture-based studies of social attention are measuring performance and drawing
conclusions that do not accurately reflect the real effect of social presence on visual attention.
