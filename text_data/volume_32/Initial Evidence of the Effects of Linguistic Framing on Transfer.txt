the Transfer of Principles
To measure degree of transfer for principles, we divided
each principle into a set of propositions that could be
included in student responses to analogous questions at each
testing occasion. There were 12 codeable propositions
relevant to the differential pressure principle and 11
codeable propositions relevant to the surface area principle
(91% agreement; Kappa = .82).
