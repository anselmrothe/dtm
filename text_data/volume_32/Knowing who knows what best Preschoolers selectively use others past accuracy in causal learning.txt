Abstract: Knowing who knows what best: Preschoolers selectively use others’ past accuracy in causal learning
   Authors: Christopher Vredenburgh, Lauren Schneider, Andy Hsia, and Tamar Kushnir
   Preschoolers use a person’s past accuracy labeling common objects as a cue to their ”trustworthiness” when
learning new words. These studies investigate how children use past accuracy to differentially trust people for causal
learning. Across two studies, we found that children (Mean age = 4 years, 3 months; SD = 4 months) would
differentially trust an accurate (versus inaccurate or ignorant) labeler for learning a novel causal function but not for
learning a novel causal mechanism. However, when an accurate labeler was pitted against a causal expert, children
trusted the expert with both causal mechanism and causal function. These studies demonstrate that children show
selective trust of accurate labelers depending on the availability of sources with causal expertise. Thus, children are
sensitive to domains of knowledge and can use them to request information from the most appropriate source.
