•   Mental simulation. Before committing to implementing
    an idea as an action, agents can use the fitness function
    to assess how fit the action would be if it were
    implemented.
•   Broadcasting. Broadcasting allows the action of a
    leader, or broadcaster, to be visible to not just immediate
    neighbors, but all agents, thereby simulating the effects
    of media such as public performances, television, radio,
    or the internet, on patterns of cultural change. Each
    agent adds the leader as a possible source of actions it
    can imitate. The leader itself is thus the only agent that
    can only acquire actions from its immediate neighbors.
    The leader can be specified by the user or chosen at
