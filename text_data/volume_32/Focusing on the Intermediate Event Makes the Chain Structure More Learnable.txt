Abstract: The chain structure has not been easily inferred when three events are causally related like a chain (A
causes B, and B in turn causes C). We hypothesized that focusing on the intermediate event make the chain structure
more learnable, if the causal structure is locally computed (Fernbach & Sloman, 2009). In Experiment 1, focusing
is manipulated by informing which event is important. Participants who were informed that the intermediate event
(B) is important inferred the chain structure (61
