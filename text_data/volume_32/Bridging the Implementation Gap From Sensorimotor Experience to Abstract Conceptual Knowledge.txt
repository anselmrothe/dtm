Abstract: We develop a sensorimotor perspective on conceptual knowledge, paying particular attention to the
imperatives of an artificial system. Motivated by the gap between low-level sensorimotor experience and humanlevel conceptual knowledge, we contrast experiential knowledge with the classical notion of concepts. We discuss
three ways in which experience and classical concepts differ: experience is dynamic rather than static, subjective
rather than objective, and composed of minutiae rather than compact abstractions. We present a mechanism for
abstracting from experience and show how it might recover some of the benefits of concepts while addressing some
of the difficulties of classical theory. Finally, we implement a simple example which illustrates first steps towards
bridging the gap between sensorimotor experience and high-level concepts.
