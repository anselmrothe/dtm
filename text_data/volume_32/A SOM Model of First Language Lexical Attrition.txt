produce a SOM model: (1) to replicate the sustained gradual
erosion of L1 lexical knowledge in both production and
comprehension, (2) to compare the respective rates of

plausible time course for long-term L1 lexical attrition, and
(4) to reveal age of onset effects in L1 lexical attrition.

comprehension after 100 epochs was 96.6% (112 out of 116
L1 words) for all models (un-averaged) with an AoO greater
than 100. After AoO began, L1 comprehension decreased
monotonically. Figure 2 shows the L1 comprehension
curves for all eight AoO conditions. At the onset of L2
training, L1 comprehension seems to approximate an
exponential decay for each AoO condition. Differences
between L1 curves are described below (see section Age of
Onset Effects).

L1 production declined severely and immediately for all
AoO conditions.         All models across all conditions
performed below 5% correct productions within four epochs
of the AoO and remained low throughout L2 training. Due
