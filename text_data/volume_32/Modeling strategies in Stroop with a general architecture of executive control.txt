matched by the rule “target”. Rule “others” matches any sti-
mulus. Memory chunks associate stimuli with proper res-
ponses. We skip other details of chunks’ description.
   Though the rule “target” has a low utility, it is fully asso-
ciated with the goal (Atarget = 1.0). The rule “trained” has
goal association much lower than Atarget, but still significant-
ly above 0 (here, Atrained = .2), as it is somehow related to
what happens during the task (e.g., when congruent stimuli
are frequent, it may be beneficial to use sometimes the
dominant rule). Thus, in every congruent and incongruent
trial there is a competition between useful rule “trained” and
goal-relevant rule “target”. This is modulated by the
strength of control (G): the stronger control is the higher is

Gratton effect The original Gratton et al.’s (1992) effect in
flanker task is often replicated within Stroop paradigm (e.g.,
Kerns et al., 2004). However, for comparision with other
models, we aimed to replicate the original effect (see Figure
1, left panel). In the first simulation study, 5000 runs of the
model were administered with 50/50 proportion of congrent
vs. incongruent trials. The ordering of trials was random.

Proportion of incongruent stimuli, facilitation, and
individual differences in Stroop performance Kane and
Engle (2003; Experiment 4) observed decrease in Stroop
interference as a result of decreasing proportion of congru-
ent simuli, when neutral stimuli were absent. Moreover, it
appeared that this proportion influenced the difference in
accuracy in incongruent trials between low- and high-work-
ing memory capacity (WMC) participants, screened with

gruent), both WMC groups scored around six percent of
errors, with no significant advantage of WMC-high group.               Figure 4: Left panel: data adapted from Kane and Engle
