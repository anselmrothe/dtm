  The instructions asked the subject to imagine oneself in
the distant future, arriving on an unknown planet (called
Terra Enigmatica) and discovering the remains of an Earth
colony that was established by speakers of both English and
Wilkipaengo (the language name was invented, so as to
avoid the influence of knowledge regarding non-English
phonotactics). The rest of the story, shown in (3), explained
the importance of matching names to creatures and stressed
that the lists ‘inadvertently’ included non-English names
that should not be assigned to creatures.

                  Results and Discussion
The effect of phonotactic legality is shown in Figure 2.
Phonotactically legal words were significantly more likely
to be assigned to creatures than the corresponding
phonotactically illegal words (by items, t(71)=8.05,
p<1/1011; by subjects, t(39) = 5.57, p<1/105).
   The legal/illegal pairs in which the illegal pseudoword
was (unexpecdtedly) used less often than the legal one are
drVC/dgVC (n=4), dwæʃ/dgæʃ, fneɪk/freɪk, kwum/kpum,
and twis/tnis.
