not occur. Yet, some form of matching must have occurred
despite the perceptual mismatch because the overall
discrimination performance (in the distinct articulation
condition) was good, average d' = 1.09.
   Values of d' between 1 and 2 usually represent good yes-
no recognition performance (Neath & Surprenant, 2003, p.
202). To further justify that this was good performance, we
conducted three planned comparisons on the d' data. The
first and second comparisons established that the data sets
between Experiments 1 and 2 were comparable:
Performance in the same-articulation conditions, as well as
performance in the similar-articulation conditions, across
both experiments did not differ, ts < 1.28, ps > .21. The
third comparison used performance in Experiment 1’s
distinct articulation condition as baseline, and revealed that
performance in Experiment 2’s distinct-articulation
condition reliably exceeded performance in this baseline
condition, t(109) = 3.44, p < .01, implicating good
discrimination performance in this case.
   Thus, the logical inference is that whether matching
would occur is likely to be contingent on the absolute
physical quantity of match between the memory trace and
the recognition probe per se, rather than the perception of         Figure 4: An example of Navon’s (1977) type hierarchical
