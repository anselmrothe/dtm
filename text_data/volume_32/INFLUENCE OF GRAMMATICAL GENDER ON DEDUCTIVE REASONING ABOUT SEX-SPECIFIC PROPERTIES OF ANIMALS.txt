   Results and Discussion
     We report the results separately for each condition.
   Generic Animal Condition Here, we only analyze the
error responses (i.e., Yes responses, see Figure 1). Response
times were not submitted to the analysis because of the high
error rates in German speakers. As expected, there was a

when the sex in the premise and the grammatical gender of
the target were consistent (53.4%) than when they were
inconsistent (29.9%), t1(16) = 3.133, d = .626, p = .006,
t2(35) = 13.447, d = 2.898, p < .000. No such difference was
found in Japanese participants (17.0% vs. 17.2%), t1(15) = -
.102, p = .920, t2(35) = -.166, p = .869. However, the
performance in German speakers in the Control condition
showed that they were in general no poorer in deductive
reasoning than Japanese speakers (German:92.5%;
Japanese:83.5%) , t1(31) = 1.821, p = .078; t2(70) = 4.597, d
= .969, p < .000 . These results suggest that the grammatical
gender effect seen in the Generic Animal condition was not
a reflection of generally poor deductive inference on the part
of German speakers.
