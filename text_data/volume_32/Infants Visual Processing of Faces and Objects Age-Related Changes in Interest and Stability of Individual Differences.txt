Participants
   Forty healthy infants (18 girls, 22 boys) were recruited
between three to four months of age to participate
longitudinally at six months (mean age = 188 days), seven
months (mean age = 219 days), eight months (mean age =
249 days), and nine months (mean age = 278 days). Each
monthly visit was scheduled within a 10-day window
based on the child’s birthday. Infants were recruited            Figure 2: Example of habituation and novel object stimuli
through announcements and flyers at local hospitals, and
visits and flyers at mother-infant recreational groups and
infant play groups in San Diego, CA. Infants and parents
were of middle-class socioeconomic level; 88% were white
and 12% were of African American, Asian American or
Hispanic descent. Parents’ mean age was 32.4 years and
mean education was 16.6 years. Recruitment and testing
procedures were approved by the UCSD Human Research
Participants Protection committee.
Stimulus and Apparatus
