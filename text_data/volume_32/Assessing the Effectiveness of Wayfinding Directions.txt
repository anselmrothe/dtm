Abstract: Our goal was to assess peopleâ€™s responses to wayfinding directions. Ninety college students rated the
effectiveness of route descriptions through the basement of a university building. They also provide open-ended responses regarding wayfinding preferences and completed wayfinding anxiety, wayfinding strategy, and environmental
familiarity self-report measures and a sense of direction exercise. The primary goal was to specify the descriptive
features contained in effective and ineffective wayfinding descriptions. The best-rated route descriptions included
more cardinal features, landmarks, left-right, distance, number, straight, and miscellaneous information than did
the worst-rated route descriptions. Moreover, positive mentions of landmarks and negative mentions of cardinal
directions were very frequent. As expected, women reported significantly higher spatial anxiety than did men. Men
preferred orientation strategies more than did women, whereas women preferred route strategies more than did men.
Women also reported poorer sense of direction and made larger sense of direction errors than did men.
