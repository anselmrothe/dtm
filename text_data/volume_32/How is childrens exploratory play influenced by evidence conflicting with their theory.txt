Abstract: Bonawitz, Lim, and Schulz (2007) demonstrated that children’s exploratory play is affected by the
interaction of their naı̈ve theories and the evidence they observe. 6- and 7-year-olds were more likely to play with a
balance toy when they observed evidence inconsistent with their balancing theory than when they observed evidence
consistent with their balancing theory. The present study was set up to investigate how children’s exploratory play
is influenced by evidence that conflicts with their theory. Do children who observe inconsistent evidence play more
systematically and make more informative comparisons than children who observe consistent evidence? 4- to 6-yearolds’ naı̈ve theories on shadow size were assessed with the shadow task (Siegler, 1981). 52 children with one specific
naı̈ve theory were selected and shown evidence consistent or inconsistent with their theory. Preliminary results show
that the inconsistent group made more informative comparisons during free exploratory play than the consistent
group.
