Abstract
We explore the relationship between the lexical structure
and the syntactical structure of numerical expressions in
number transcoding from the oral verbal format to the
Arabic digital format. The experimental setup included
asking six to eight-year old Spanish-speaking children
attending elementary school to write in Arabic format a set
of dictated numerals. The method of analysis includes the
construction of a relational representation of children's
production and the use of clustering techniques to identify
patterns. The model relates children and dictated numerals
by children's accomplishment and generates a subsidiary
similitude relation between dictated numerals with patterns
that show differentiated structures. We find that the
presence or absence of a verbal expression for the Hundred
position digit in the dictated numeral marks one of the
structures. The second structure comes from the role of two
digit numbers (e.g. 20 or 34): homogeneous in the Decade
position and heterogeneous in the Thousand position. We
interpret these results as consistent with the semantic-lexical
internal number representation model by R.J.D. Power and
M.F. Dal Martello, The dictation of Italian numerals,
Language and Cognitive Processes, 5, 237-254; 1990.

Introduction
McCloskey, Caramazza and Basili made in 1985
(McCloskey, Caramazza, & Basili, 1985) a pioneering
proposal in adult neuropsychology of cognitive mechanisms
in number processing and calculation. They posted the
existence of a number comprehension mechanism, a number
production mechanism and a calculation system with a
numerical
internal
representation.
The
number
comprehension mechanism translates a numerical input into
the internal representation and the number production
mechanism translates from the internal representation into
the output format required. Comprehension and production
mechanisms process both verbal and Arabic numerals and
distinguish lexical-processing and syntactic-processing
components. Lexical processing involves comprehension or
production of individual elements in a number. Syntactic
processing involves the relations among numerical elements

in order to comprehend or to produce a number as a whole.
The number internal representation in this model is
semantic-abstract, with numbers expressed in basic
quantities associated to abstract forms of the base-10
representation (e.g. 2x101 and 5x100 for twenty five). The
model specifies that the internal representation activates the
syntactical production mechanism and that the highest
power of ten in the central representation generates a
syntactic frame with the appropriate number of slots or
positions for the production of the Arabic numeral. This
representation is independent of the structure of verbal
representation. The semantic base-10 representation implies
that the peculiarities of verbal stimulus do not exert any
influence on the Arabic production mechanisms.
Number transcoding, defined as translating a numeral
from one code to another one, has been used to explore
number processing in impaired subjects and adolescents
with mild retardation (Barrouillet, Camos, Perruchet &
Seron, 2004; Granà, Lochy, Girelli, Seron, & Semenza,
2003; McCloskey, 1991; McCloskey & Caramazza, 1987;
McCloskey et al., 1985; McCloskey & Macaruso, 1995;
Seron & Noël, 1995) and in groups of children (Barrouillet
et al., 2004; Power & Dal Martello, 1990; 1997; Seron &
Fayol, 1994). From these works two main explanatory
models for number processing in children arise: One
proposes the existence of a semantic representation of
numerical quantities, which can be either semantic-abstract
(Macaruso, McCloskey & Aliminosa, 1993; McCloskey,
1991; McCloskey et al., 1985) or semantic-lexical (Power &
Dal Martello, 1990); the other perspective proposes an
asemantic model where number processing results from
assembling rules or algorithms (Deloche & Seron, 1982,
1987; Barrouillet et al., 2004). Some models propose both
routes.
In the semantic-lexical model posted by Power and Dal
Martello (1990) working with children “the form of the
representation reflects the structure of the subject’s verbal
numeral system.”. To these authors the internal
representation is due to the interpretation of the verbal
numeral and its internal structure tied to the verbal code.
They propose sum and product structures as the main
relationships between numerical concepts and, from the
subject perspective, an overwriting rule for the sum operator
and a concatenation rule for the product in Arabic

2212

production. In this model a product relation produces
numerals as 200 and 2000 from primitive numerical
concepts as Ones, Teens, Tens and Hundred, and a sum
relation to obtain composed numerals as 220, 2020, 20220.
For Power and Dal Martello (1990) “Every non-primitive
number is represented as the sum or product of two unequal
numbers”. They show that syntactic errors, related to the
numeral structure (e.g. 20045 for two hundred forty five),
are more frequent than lexical errors related to the exchange
of digits (e.g.. 255 for two hundred forty five).
An asemantic model that predicts children production was
developed by Barrouillet et al., (2004), “ADAPT: A
Developmental, Asemantic and Procedural Model for
Transcoding from Verbal to Arabic Numerals”, with two
BASIC
versions: the basic (ADAPT
) and the advanced
ADV
(ADAPT
). The first version describes the transcoding
process for numerals up to 99 and the second up to six digit
BASIC
numbers. The main proposal of the ADAPT
model is
that when a verbal string for transcoding corresponds to a
representational unit stored in Long Term Memory (LTM),
this string is processed as such, whereas its transcription is
the result of the direct memory retrieval of its digital form.
ADV
In the ADAPT
version, an algorithm is used to explain
transcoding from the verbal numeral format to the Arabic
digital format. For writing numerals the model assumes that
the verbal expression is coded in a phonological code and
analyzed by a parser. The results of the analysis are
processing units that can be either elements whose digital
transcription can be directly retrieved from LTM or
separators, as Hundred and Thousand. These processing
units trigger the transcoding rules that in a serial process
generate either slots, digits or digit chains. (Barrouillet et
al., 2004)
The present work heads number processing by identifying
patterns of relationship between the lexical (phonetic)
structure of verbal expressions and one syntactical structure
of the Arabic expressions in children’s production
transcoding numbers from the oral verbal to the Arabic
digital format. Our model includes a positional analysis
using similarity, structural equivalence (Borgatti, Everet,
Freeman, 2002; Johnson, 1967; Wasserman & Faust, 1994)
and betweenness (Freeman, 1979; Girvan & Newman,
2002). The novelty of this analysis is the use of a relational
representation children’s production. The most relevant
findings are two syntactic structures: One pined to the
presence or absence of a verbal expression in the Hundred
position of the dictated numeral, and other one which
differentiates Decade forms (e.g. 20 or 70) and Decade-Unit
forms (e.g. 34 or 76) when they are at Thousand position
(e.g. 30.432 or 37.432).

Method
In this section we present the experimental setup and the
model of analysis used in this study.

Participants
The experimental setup included the dictation of numerals
to 207 children attending first, second and third grades of
elementary school in Colombia. First grade children (65)
were 6 years and 8.3 months old with standard deviation
SD=2.9 months, second grade children (74) were 7 years
and 7.0 months old (SD=3.0 months) and third grade
children (68) were 8 years and 7.8 months old (SD=3.0
months).

Experimental procedure
The experiment consisted of asking children to transcode a
set of dictated numerals from the oral verbal format to the
Arabic one. Numerals were dictated in Spanish in a 20minute testing session to each child. Dictated numbers were
of a higher order than those traditionally taught at the
corresponding school grade. Four dictation lists with the
same set of numbers were generated randomly in each grade
and assigned randomly to each child. The set of numbers
included all lexical and syntactic forms for three, for and
five digit numerals in Arabic code. The notation used to
classify numerals is: a, b, c, d and e letters which represent
the digital forms different from zero and correspond to the
basic quantities of the numeral in the Arabic format (ex.
3789 is abcd). In all of the cases a represents the highest
order quantity of the Arabic format. The 0 digit represents a
null quantity. We use x to represent either a basic or a null
quantity.

Method of analysis
Network analysis perspective uses graphs to represent and
study complex systems in terms of relations between
elements or parts. It gives a detailed account of structural
and dynamical properties of systems by identifying patterns
at the microscopic level and macroscopic phenomena.
(Freeman, 2004; Wasserman & Faust, 1994)
Our model of analysis defines ties between numerals in
terms of correlations in children’s production: Two
numerals are tied with a strength equal to the number of
children with production syntactically and lexically correct
or incorrect for both numerals. The relation defined in this
way does not have internal structure and therefore it is
suitable for exploring elementary structures and patterns. As
the relation expresses similarity, we use graph visual
representations (Freeman, 2005), Johnson’s hierarchical
clustering (Johnson, 1967), structural equivalence (Breiger,
Boorman, & Arabie, 1975; Burt, 1976) and tie betweenness
for cohesive subgroups (Girvan & Newman, 2002). These
techniques have been implemented in computer codes as
Netdraw (Borgatti, 2002) and UCINET (Borgatti, Everett &
Freeman, 2002).
Visual exploration: Low dimensional graph representations
of networks are often used to organize nodes and ties in
landscapes where the location of a node is related to its
actual location in the network. We use a spring embedded
model with node repulsion, equal edge length and similitude

2213

by geodesic distances. (Borgatti, 2002; Freeman, 2005;
Wasserman & Faust, 1994)
Proximity clustering: Johnson's hierarchical clustering
identifies clusters from correlations. (Borgatti, Everett, &
Freeman, 2002; Johnson, 1967; Wasserman & Faust, 1994)
It uses similarities or dissimilarities to find a series of nested
partitions by departing from N partitions, each one with a
node, and joining partitions in successive steps according to
their relative distance from adding individual distances to
other nodes.
Structural equivalence: Nodes with structurally equivalent
positions in the network have identical relational profiles
and are tied to the same nodes. We use two techniques to
identify structural equivalence: Convergence of iterated
correlations between profile vectors (CONCOR), based on
Pearson’s correlation (Borgatti, Everett, & Freeman, 2002;
Breiger, Boorman, & Arabie, 1975; Lerner, 2005;
Wasserman & Faust, 1994), and the Euclidean distance
from each node to all other nodes (Borgatti, Everett, &
Freeman, 2002; Burt, 1976; Wasserman & Faust, 1994).
Clustering by tie betweenness: Freeman (1979) defined
betweenness centrality for a vertex or node as the number of
shortest paths between any other two nodes passing by the
node. Girvan and Newman (2002) extended this concept in
order to identify cohesive subgroups by removing ties or
links with the highest values of betweenness. This method
relies on the fact that a tie linking two non-overlapping
clusters must have the highest betweenness in the graph. In
our analysis we combine successive weak strength and high
betweenness ties removal to identify clusters.

(SD 3.2), for ab0d 19.8 (SD 4.1), for a0c0 17.8 (SD 1.8)
and for a0cd numerals 15.7 (SD 3.1). Numbers with verbal
expressions in the Hundred position (abxx) have 38.2% of
correct answers and numbers without verbal expression in
the Hundred position (a0xx) have 31.4%. For abxx numerals
the mean of correct answers per child is 24.8 (SD 4.5) and
for a0cx numerals 16.4 (SD 2.5).

Results
The results from applying the selected analysis techniques
to children’s production are presented for each grade
including frequency analysis, visual exploration, proximity
clustering, structural equivalence and tie betweenness.
First grade children’s production included 1.047 (44.7%)
correct answers from 2.340 dictated numerals (36 numerals
to 65 children). The highest frequency of correct answers
was for naught numerals (40%), then for a0c (25%), ab0
(18%) and abc (17%) numerals. Table 1. The mean of
correct answers for child is 29 (SD 11); for naught numerals
47 (SD 6.5), a0c 29 (SD 2.5), ab0 21 (SD 2.6), and abc
numerals 20 (SD 2.7). All clustering techniques confirm the
existence of three subgroups: 1) a00; 2) a0c; 3) ab0 and
abc. Figure 1 shows the graph obtained with Netdraw
(Borgatti, 2002). The ties between numerals in the graph
have at least 53 children each. Shapes of nodes indicate
numeral classification: abc, ab0, a0c, a00.
Second grade children’s production included 1.613
correct answers from 4.366 dictated numerals (37.0%). The
highest percentage of correct answers was for naught
numerals (a000) (78.8%), then for a00d (49.9%), ab00
(45.8%), abc0 (39.7%), abcd (34.0%), a0c0 (27.4%) and
a0cd numerals (24.2%). See Table 1. The mean and
standard deviation (SD) of correct answers per child are: for
naught numerals 51.2 (SD 4.2), for a00d 32.4 (SD 3.8), for

Frequency analysis, Johnson's hierarchical clustering,
structural equivalence from Euclidean distances and tie
bewteenness indicates the existence of four main subgroups:
Naught numerals, a00d, a0cx; and abxx numerals. However,
structural equivalence from CONCOR gives four
subgroups: two for naught numerals (one containing 3000,
6000, 8000 and 9000), one for a0xx and one for abxx
numerals. Results from CONCOR have to be considered
because the main ability of this technique is to recognize

2214

patterns. Figure 2 shows the graph obtained with Netdraw
(Borgatti, 2002). The ties between numerals in the graph
have at least 55 children each. Shapes of nodes indicate
numeral classification: abcd, abc0, ab0d, ab00, a0cd, a0c0,
a00d, a000.

24731; and 35246 (See Table 2). This classification is
consistent with a differentiation between axcxx and ax0xx
numerals.

grade children’s productions.

Figure 3: Graph for the relation between numerals in third
grade children’s productions.

Third grade children’s production included 1.992 correct
answers from 3.672 dictated numerals (54.3%). The highest
achievement was for naught numerals (a0000) (73.8%).
Numerals with verbal expression in the Hundred position
(axcxx) are more frequently correct (55.8%) than numerals
without verbal expression on this position (ax0xx) (39.7%),
excluding naught numerals. The mean of correct answers
per child for axcxx numerals is 38.2 with SD 3.8 and for
ax0xx is 27.9 with SD 3.3. (See Table 1)

Discussion
First grade results show the existence of three subgroups of
numerals in children’s production: naught numerals, a0c
and abx numerals. None of the analysis techniques shows
any internal structure in the subgroups indicating that each
one is homogeneous. Power & Dal Martello (1990) also

2215

found differences in children’s production between
numerals ending in 00 (a00), numerals with internal zero
(a0c), and numerals without internal zero (ab0, abc). Seron
and Fayol (1994) predicted the following order of
acquisition a00 > a0c > abc = ab0. They did not find other
significant difference between the proposed forms. Their
results are consistent with a higher frequency of errors for
ab0 and abc numerals than for a0c numerals. For Barrouillet
et al., (2004) the Decade-Unit form (bc) in abc numerals
and the Decade form (b0) in ab0 numerals are retrieved
from LTM as representational units and the error rate did
not present any significant difference between the two forms
in three and four digit numbers. In our results ab0 and abc
numerals are both similar and equivalent.
For second grade, results indicate the existence of four
main subgroups: 1) naught numerals, 2) a00d, 3) a0cx, and
4) abxx. One clustering technique, CONCOR, indicates that
a00c and a0cx numerals should belong to the same
subgroup, in agreement with Figure 2. Additionally, in our
study the a00d numeral with the highest rate of correct
answers was 2008, which has the same structure as the
number of the year when the experimental testing was done.
We consider that this fact might have influenced the
production of a00d numerals.
We interpret these results as that the presence or absence
of a verbal expression in the Hundred position of the
dictated numeral determines the digital production. In the
case of Spanish, three types of expressions are assigned to
the Hundred verbal expression: cien for one hundred,
quinientos for five hundred and cientos accompanied by a
prefix in all other cases as in trecientos for three hundred.
Note that a1xx numerals were more frequently correct than
abxx ones (Table 1.).
An important difference between our results and
Barrouillet et al., (2004) is that they found higher rates of
errors for the Unit form 0d in ax0d than for the Decade form
c0 in axc0 and the Decade-Unit for cd in axcd. Our results
indicate the opposite situation in agreement with Power and
Dal Martello (1990) and Seron and Fayol (1994).
In third grade production frequency analysis, visual
exploration, Johnson’s hierarchical clustering, structural
equivalence and tie betweenness indicate the existence of
three main subgroups: Naught numerals, ax0xx excluding
naught numerals, and axcxx numerals. Note that ax1xx
numerals were more frequently correct than axbxx ones
(Table 1.). Additionally, ab00e numerals obtained the
lowest frequency of correct answers, in contrast with a00d
numerals that obtained a high frequency in second grade
children’s production.
However, CONCOR neatly differentiates between abcxx
and a0cxx numerals. This result is not consistent with
Barrouillet et al., (2004) proposal for Decade-Unit and
Decade forms as being retrieved directly from LTM.
Instead, it might be explained by considering that the
difference between these forms is the number of operations
for their construction (one product for Decade forms and
one product and one sum for Decade-Unit forms), as

proposed by Barrouillet et al., (2004) for complex Decade
forms in French (e.g. soixante-dix for seventy and quatrevingt-dix for ninety) or by Power and Dal Martello (1990).

Conclusions
First, the presence or absence of a verbal expression in the
Hundred position of dictated four and five digit numerals
generate differentiated structures in children’s written
production. This result indicates that the lexical (phonetic)
structure in the oral verbal format interacts with the
syntactic structure of Arabic digits in children’s production
in number transcoding.
Secondly, the difference found between abcxx and a0cxx
numerals in children’s production calls for new explicative
efforts.
Finally, the method of analysis used gives valuable
information that can not be obtained from frequency
analysis or simple statistics.
