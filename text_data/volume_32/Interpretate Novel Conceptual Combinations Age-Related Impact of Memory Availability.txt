Abstract: This study looks at how combinations of two French nouns (”Incendie Brûlure”/”Fire Burn” ; ”Voiture
Tortue”/”Turtle Car”) are interpreted. The order of occurrence of the constituents of two types of conceptual
combinations, Relation and Property, was manipulated in view of determining how property-based and relationbased interpretations evolve with age. Three groups of French-speaking children (ages 6, 8, and 10) and a group of
adults performed an interpretation-selection task. The results for the children indicated that while property-based
interpretations increased with age, relation-based interpretations were in the majority for both combination types,
whereas for the adults, relation-based interpretations were in the minority for property combinations. For the children
and adults alike, the most frequent interpretations were ones in which the head noun came first and was followed by
the modifier (the opposite of the order observed for English).
