IFORs may exist updating those representations must be
prioritized somehow. If priority of updating between IFORs
goes according to salience, as Wang et al. (2005) found for
updating target priority within one IFOR, then response time
should vary with the targeted IFOR’s relative salience. That
is, when two IFORs conflict the conflict should be resolved
most easily in favor of the more salient IFOR. Furthermore,

effect for the conditions in which a switch of attended IFOR
was likely hints that the establishment of an IFOR is able to
take advantage of spatial representations already in working
memory. IFORs, therefore, may be limited to one
instantiation at a time as a function of human working
memory capacity, but they may be disbanded and
instantiated dynamically, taking advantage of whatever
spatial representation may be available at the time to be
incorporated into the IFOR to support task performance as
necessary
   It is clear that attention plays a central role in mediating
IFOR representational conflicts and in modulating salience.
