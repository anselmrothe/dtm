Abstract: This study addresses the interaction between stimulus encoding and learning. Specifically I address the
acquisition of arithmetic principle knowledge and its relation to learners arithmetic equation encoding. Arithmetic
principle knowledge has been shown to be a key aspect of early mathematical development. Behavioral results
suggest that children with experience encoding relevant characteristics show a change in their principle knowledge.
Computational results mirror this finding. Model instantiations in which the same equation encoding is used show
similar behavior. I take this as preliminary evidence of a direct connection between the encoding of arithmetic
equations and knowledge in the arithmetic domain. This has clear applications to both developmental theory and
educational practice.
