individual differences in adjacency learning is then used to

After a participant had responded to the last nonword, the

   An intended consequence of this design is that, for any
given trial, the first element of a string cannot be anticipated
in advance of hearing the auditory target. However, all
subsequent string transitions might be reliably anticipated
using statistical knowledge of the bigram structure. Thus, as
participants become sensitive to the bigrams, they should be
able to anticipate the string transitions, which should be
evidenced by faster response times (following standard SRT
rationale). Accordingly, our dependent measure on each trial
was the reaction time (RT) for a predictive target, subtracted
from the RT for the non-predictive initial-column target
