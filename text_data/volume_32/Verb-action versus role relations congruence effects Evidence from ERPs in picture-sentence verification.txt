with early (200-400ms) mismatch effects observed by Vis-
sers et al., we also measured ERPs from 200-400 ms at the
first noun. Analyses revealed more negative going ERPs to
role mismatches than matches (p < 0.01). Following the an-
terior negativity, a relative positivity for mismatches was ob-
served, largest over posterior scalp, beginning around 400ms
after noun onset and continuing beyond the onset of the sub-
sequent verb. This effect was reliable from 0-100 ms and
100-300 ms following the verb (p < 0.01). These role con-
gruence effects were also reliable when analyzed relative to a
pre-noun baseline. They did, however, not last into the later
portion of the verb (300-500 ms).
