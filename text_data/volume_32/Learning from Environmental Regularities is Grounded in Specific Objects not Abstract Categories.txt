same stimulus timing (short durations and long inter-
stimulus-intervals) as employed by Brady and Oliva (2008)
which will likely tap into the fast, gist-based recognition of
the pictures. Finally, the stream has fewer pairs of categories
than objects (see Figure 1). Thus, category level learning is,
in some sense, easier than object-based learning.
   Using the same methodology as Brady and Oliva (2008)
as described above, pilot testing confirmed that when
categorical regularities are predictive of picture order but
individual objects or exemplars are not participants can
learn based on categorical regularities: mean = 62.6%, t(13)
= 2.80, p < 0.05. These results confirm that if object-based
regularities are not present, category-level statistical
learning is possible using the current stimuli and categories.
   Finally, in order to more closely examine how learning
proceeds at the categorical level of information, we
manipulated the typicality of the exemplars that participants
viewed: roughly half the participants were familiarized with
typical exemplars of the categories and the rest were                   Figure 1: A sample familiarization stream. Pictures were

categorical knowledge, when less abstract regularities are
present. This is an important avenue for future study to
clarify this lexical result. An alternative possibility is that
the lexical access is a byproduct of the participant strategy
of using mental labels for the familiar objects and scenes as
they are being presented. Previous statistical learning
studies have been careful to avoid recognizable visual
objects for this reason (Conway & Christiansen, 2005; Fiser

   Despite our findings that adults did not learn from
abstract, category level regularities when object-based
regularities were present, it is nevertheless clear that in a
natural environment we do acquire knowledge of higher
order regularities. Thus, our results may simply point to a
direction of how this learning occurs: learning starts in the
