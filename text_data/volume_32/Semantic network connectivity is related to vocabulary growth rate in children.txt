            Words connected to other words
   Words exist in a sea of other words. The semantic
relations among these words play an explanatory role in
language comprehension and processing (e.g., Lund &
Burgess, 1996; Jones & Mewhort, 2007). These relations are
often studied in terms of semantic networks (Collins &
Quillian, 1969; Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005). Recent
advances in graph theory reveal that adult semantic networks
have properties that may be important to language
processing, and potentially also to word learning.
