Abstract: Abstract: We examined the influence of the perspective during exploration on the ability of subjects to
point correctly to memorized targets in a virtual 3D environment. This environment consisted of a two-storied factory
building with 32 machines on the ground floor. Four machines were marked as targets. Eight trials were conducted
in each of the four different perspectives: map view from above, four different views from the corners, perceiving
the environment as a person walking through it, and following an avatar through the environment. Subsequently,
participants were asked to point to the four targets from the upper floor.
We expected the best performance in the map view as all information is given in a single reference frame and a
rotation suffices for pointing. Surprisingly, eleven of the nineteen participants performed best in conditions different
from the most straightforward. This finding indicates that different memorization strategies were used by different
persons.
