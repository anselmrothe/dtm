   The present research aims to further explore the influence
of anxiety on analogical mapping by exploiting the anxiety-

anxiety impedes relational choices in this task rather than
facilitate them, as shown under negative mood (Hristova,
2009), then it would be relatively safe to conclude that the
diverse negative emotions (to be more specific, anxiety
compared to negative mood) exert different effects on
analogy-making. If the opposite trend is observed then the
picture of influence of anxiety on analogical mapping is                                           B

The main idea of this experiment is to test whether an
induced state of anxiety will change the type of relational                     T1                               T2

or lower than in a non-anxiety state.
