Abstract: A major challenge in category learning research is designing novel stimuli that are functionally meaningful,
then presenting them in an environment that is sufficiently controlled while remaining true to the dynamic nature of
the real world. The interactive online environment Second Life represents an interesting methodological setting for
such work, offering sophisticated stimulus design software, a powerful scripting language, and a fully editable physics
engine. Two well-documented phenomena of category learning are ”compression” (where objects classified together
appear more similar) and ”expansion” (where objects classified differently appear more different). Our studies using
Second Life have thus far demonstrated its utility as a research tool by 1) successfully creating a compression effect
”in world,” 2) showing that this effect did not require verbal labels, and 3) revealing that a more interactive version
of the task with much more complex and naturalistic stimuli produced learning without compression or expansion
effects.
