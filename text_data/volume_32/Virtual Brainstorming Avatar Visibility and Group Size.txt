Abstract: Dyads and triads of college students brainstormed via computer based text chat rather than face-toface. In one condition, participants were represented as 3D avatars in a virtual space. In another, no avatars were
visible. It was hypothesized that triads would outperform dyads due to facilitation from a third perspective, and
that having avatars visible would increase participants’ sense of presence and task involvement, resulting in better
performance. Participants were given standard brainstorming instructions that emphasized withholding criticism,
generating unusual ideas, generating as many ideas as possible, and piggybacking on others’ ideas. The task was
to generate ideas as for how to improve the university. Participants were surveyed after the problem solving task
regarding their sense of presence and task involvement. Triads outperformed dyads but there was no facilitation of
presence or idea generation from having visible avatar representations. Implications for the believability of virtual
environments are discussed.
