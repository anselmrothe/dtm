Abstract: A reversal of the hindsight bias, termed the propensity effect, has been found with dynamic stimuli when
likelihood estimates of an event are lower among people with outcome knowledge than among those without outcome
knowledge (Roese, Fessel, Summerville, Kruger, & Dilich, 2006). One hundred sixty-two participants were shown a
vehicular accident depicted either by diagrams or by an animation. Some participants saw information leading up
to the accident and were asked to predict the likelihood of an accident occurring. Others saw the accident and were
instructed to disregard this outcome knowledge before providing a likelihood estimate. Results contradicted previous
findings; the propensity effect occurred with diagrams and the hindsight bias occurred with the animation. Evidence
for the propensity effect appears to depend on how stimuli are constructed and the point at which participants are
asked to disregard outcome information. The present findings indicate that different presentation modes influence
decision making.
