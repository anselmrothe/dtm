would have the same expectation as ABCABCABC. In the
second model, we treated the events A, B, and C as transitions
(or bigrams): for each object, we created a separate MDM for
events that happen next. This model represents three separate
MDMs that capture the transitions between events.
   Both of these forms of the MDM provide an estimate of
what an ideal observer would infer about the structure of the
world. However, a model of infant’s beliefs alone is not suf-
ficient to predict their behavior: what is needed additionally
is a set of linking assumptions that relate beliefs to actions.
Here, we assume that the infant’s looking behavior is at least
partially determined by the information-theoretic properties
of the model. Specifically, we test whether the predictabil-
ity of a stimulus according to an idealized learning model
influences infants’ looking behavior. Formally, we use the
negative log probability of the current event according to the
model, conditioned on observing all the previous events. As
this negative log probability increases, the current event is
more surprising: for instance, after seeing a long sequence
of As, a B would have a high negative log probability. Neg-
ative log probability is a convenient measure because it cor-
responds to the number of bits of information conveyed by
the stimulus. Thus, negative log probability provides a mea-
surement at each point in time of the unpredictability of an
event, using a measure that is typically used as a measure
of information content. Because of the form of the MDM,
the model roughly predicts that events in the future will tend
to occur with their already-observed probability. However,
the model essentially adds a small amount of smoothing—
parameterized by alpha—that prevents unseen events from                  Figure 1: Infant look-away probabilities as a function of non-
