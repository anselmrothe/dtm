 The results of the surprise recognition test were analyzed
in order to compare between conditions (attending pictures         A.

Overall, recognition performance was significantly better
after attending to the words when compared with after
attending to the pictures (59.4%, SE=1.08 vs. 46.7%,

after attending to the words was significantly better than
