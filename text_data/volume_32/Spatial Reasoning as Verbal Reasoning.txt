   Overall, we were able to present some evidence for our
assumption that the process of constructing a “verbal men-
tal model” from premises influences deductive spatial rea-
soning. The chosen interpretation for the implicit direction
of the queue has consequences on what kind of conclusions
can be easily made. And, most importantly, for indeterminate
problems, we can predict which model is preferred over the
other and and which model is more difficult to consider as a
possible interpretation of the premises. While our model can
not necessarily be generalized to other domains of reasoning
we feel that it can describe some aspects of human reason-
ing with spatial relations and that it demonstrates that spatial
reasoning can also be conceived as verbal reasoning.
