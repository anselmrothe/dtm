Abstract: Recent research indicates that fluency in more than one language has consequences for fundamental
aspects of the cognitive system beyond that of speaking two languages. Specifically, a now growing body of research
shows speakers of two languages can allocate their attention more efficiently than speakers of one language in
nonlinguistic tasks (e.g., Bialystok, Klein, Craik, & Viswanathan, 2004). In addition, bilingualism has also been
shown to promote abilities in the linguistic domain, such as the ability to learn novel words better than monolinguals
(Kaushanskaya and Marian, 2009). In the present study, we investigated how the efficiency of attentional allocation
and the ability to learn novel words may interact and affect performance in Yu and Smith’s (2007) cross-situational
word learning paradigm. Monolingual and bilingual adults’ learning of 18 novel words using this paradigm were
examined, and results help to better understand the effects of bilingualism on cognition.
