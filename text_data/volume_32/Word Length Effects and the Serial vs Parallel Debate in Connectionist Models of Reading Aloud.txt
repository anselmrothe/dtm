Abstract: In reading aloud, naming latency (i.e., reaction time) increases linearly as the number of written symbols
in a word increases (e.g., Rastle, Havelka, Wydell, Coltheart, & Besner, 2009). Advocates of dual-route models have
argued that these effects can be accounted for by connectionist models that have a serial processing component,
but not by models that are completely parallel when a single fixation is assumed. However, this conclusion is valid
only for the specific assumptions made in parallel models implemented to date, and is not valid more generally. As
Townsend and colleagues (Snodgrass & Townsend, 1980; Townsend, 1972) have argued, parallel models can mimic
linearly increasing RTs as the number of items to be processed increases if stochastic processing times, limited
processing capacity (i.e., attention), and a self-terminating stopping rule (i.e., the criterion to initiate articulation
corresponding to the segment) are considered.
