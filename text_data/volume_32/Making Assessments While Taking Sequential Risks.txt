in studies 1 and 2, respectively. The average baseline inter-
pump time in both studies was 181.38 ms (SD = 58.4) and
178.47 ms (SD = 54.22). The average within-subject
standard deviation of inter-pump times on the baseline task
was 53.91 ms (SD = 32.14) and 55.38 ms (SD = 40.66).
   Recall we defined an assessment as any pump during the
BART for which its respective inter-pump time exceeded 3
standard deviations above the baseline inter-pump time.
With that definition, 11.1% of the pump opportunities from
study 1 and 16.35% from study 2 would be classified as
assessments. This yields an average assessment rate of 4.3
and 5.6 assessments per trial respectively. A plot of inter-
pump times from a single subject and balloon trial is shown          Figure 2: Change in Assessment Rate by Trial Number
