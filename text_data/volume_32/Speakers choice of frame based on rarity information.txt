                         Study 2-B
In Study 2-B, we examined belief of rarity about what posi-
tive and negative words describe. We predicted that people
generally have the belief that what positive words describe
is rarer than what negative words describe.
Method:
Participants. The participants were 116 Aoyama Gakuin
University students, who received partial course credit.
Task and materials. Participants were asked about their
belief of rarity on what positive and negative words describe
using a questionnaire. The question was as follows:                   Figure 2. P-Bias index for 26 pairs in Study 2-A.
        There are 26 pairs in this booklet. Two words
        in each of pairs have opposite meanings. Im-
        agine “people,” “things,” or “outcomes” that
        are described by each of the words in a pair.
        Then which do you think is more unusual to
        become such people, to make such things, or
        to achieve such outcomes?
For this question, participants were required to choose either
a positive or negative word from a pair. We used the same
26 pairs that were used in Study 2-A. If it is unusual to be-
come, make, or achieve what a word describes, what the
word describes must be rare. Hence we assume that a se-
lected word in a pair is judged to refer to something rarer
than the reference of the other word in the pair.

conditions were the same as those in Study 1 with the ex-
ception of the labels of dies. In place of the black-white
labels, we used winning-losing2 labels, which have positive
and negative meanings. In one of the 9 conditions, partici-
pants read the following story:
        There is a die that is described “winning” on one
        side and described “losing” on the other five sides.
        You have rolled this die 6 times, and results are as
        follows:

        sults, “The die came up winning 1 out of 6 times” or
        “The die came up losing 5 out of 6 times”?
As in the Study 1, participants were required to choose one
of two frames (i.e., “winning” frame or “losing” frame) to
describe the outcomes.
      For this task, there were 9 experimental conditions as
in Study 1. Three dies differed in the description (i.e., win-
ning rare, losing rare, winning-losing equal), and there were
three patterns of outcomes from roll of die. These three dies
