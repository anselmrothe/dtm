Measures
Eye movements were recorded using an SMI iView X™
RED eye tracker at a temporal resolution of 60 Hz. It tracks
the corneal reflection of the pupils and allows relatively free
movement of the head when seated approximately 60 cm
from the tracking device. As it allows eye tracking with
glasses and contact lenses, a wide range of participants
could be included.
Expertise was assessed with multiple questions: whether
participants’ had experience in actively playing soccer in a
club or not, how often they watched soccer on television
(never, seldom, several times a year, several times a month),
and how they evaluate their own soccer knowledge in
comparison to a famous soccer player on a rating scale.
   Participants who actively played soccer in a club, watched
soccer more frequently by trend (t = -1.98, df = 16, p < .1)
and had higher knowledge (t = 3.12, df = 16, p < .01).
Therefore, a differentiation based on experience in playing
soccer seems to be a valid measure of expertise.
