consistency explains 38% of the overall variance on
inference acceptance rates, whereas real-world plausibility
only accounts for 5% of the variance. However, analogical
rigor is also influenced by particular content. Specifically,
participants were more likely to reject structurally consistent
inferences when they were implausible. If individuals had

   In short, the results so far suggest that people are able to
