    The same pattern would be predicted by Ariel’s (1990)
accessibility hierarchy: less informative anaphora are predicted to
prefer more salient antecedents. The zero anaphor in the infinitival
construction in French, prefers the subject as the most salient
antecedent. Using a full pronoun can thus be interpreted as a cue to
search for a less salient antecedent which would be the object in
sentences such as (1).                                                        Figure 1: Example of the visual stimulus material
