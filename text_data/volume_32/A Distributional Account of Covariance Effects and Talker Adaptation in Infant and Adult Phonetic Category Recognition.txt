Figure 1: Four Possible Speech Perception Models: M 1 treats all features as linguistic, M 2 distinguishes the true and false
linguistic features, M 3 models individual talkers and treats some features as indexical, and M 4 models talkers where the
indexical features are absent or obscured. The variables are defined as follows: c is the speech sound category, t is the talker, x
is a linguistic feature, y is an indexical feature, and the other variables are distributional parameters, defining talker and category
specific distributions. C is the set of categories, T is the set of talkers, and S is the set of all speech sound tokens.
