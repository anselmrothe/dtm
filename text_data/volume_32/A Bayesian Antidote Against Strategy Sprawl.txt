Fortunately, a closed-form mathematical solution, is not
mandatory to estimate marginal likelihood because all that
is needed is a representative sample from the integral of
Equation 1 that is large enough to draw reliable conclusions
on the shape of the distribution. Such a sample may be
obtained by means of Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
methods for which statistical packages are readily available
(Gilks, Richardson, & Spiegelhalter, 1996). For the present
analysis, we utilized utilized the OpenBugs software
implemented in the BRugs package, version 0.51, that can
be integrated into the statistics software R.
   Similar to the mathematical solution outlined above, the
implementation in BRugs requires the specification of prior
distributions and likelihood functions. Provided it is
properly implemented, the software returns the evidence as
