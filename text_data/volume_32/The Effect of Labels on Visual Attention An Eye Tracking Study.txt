Results and Discussion
All participants correctly identified the novel stimuli on
every test trial; therefore, no one was excluded from the
current study. Primary analyses presented below focused on
adults’ attention to common and unique features during
familiarization.
   Unfiltered gaze data were exported from the computer
using Tobii Studio gaze analysis software. A point of gaze
was recorded if a participant made a fixation to pre-
determined areas of interests (AOIs). Four AOIs were
defined as a rectangle surrounding the four parts of each
stimulus image. Gaze data were combined for the two                      Figure 2: Adults’ mean preference for unique features by

measure of looking to unique or common features per
refresh rate. These data were used to calculate unique and
common feature preference scores based on the proportion
of looking time to either unique or common features as
compared to the total time looking to all features combined.
Effect of Unique Labels           To determine if unique labels
pushed adults’ attention to unique features, we compared
preference for unique features in the unique label condition
to preference for unique features in the silent condition.
   Gaze data were analyzed using a moving average of
participants’ attention across time to smooth out temporary
fluctuations within a given trial (i.e., 3 trials were averaged
per time point such that time point 1 averaged trials 1 to 3,
time point 2 averaged trials 2 to 4, and so on). A repeated-
