Experiment 1 investigated whether human foragers are
sensitive to the distribution of resources in the environment

keyboard. Translation speed was set to 4m/s and turning
velocity was set to 75°/s. The motion model allowed for
either forward translations or rotations but did not allow
combining translations and rotations. Thus, the resulting
trajectories resembled segmented paths (see Figure 4).
Participants collected resource items simply by moving
closer than .75m to an item. This pick-up distance was just
below half of the minimal distance between any two
resource items and therefore assured that participants
gathered only one item at any time. The collection of a
resource item was signaled by an auditory cue. Once an item
had been collected it was removed from the environment.

task was to navigate through the environment and to collect
resource items. Each participant was given 5 trials. Each
trial was carried out in a different environment with the
same type of resource distribution (dispersed or patched). At
the beginning of each trial, participants were placed in the            Fig. 4: Example trajectories in the dispersed
