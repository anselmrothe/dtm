Materials
Two featureless, rigid brown barriers (92 cm x 58 cm) were
placed side-by-side 1.2 m apart. Two 2D foam shapes (10.2
cm x 10.2 cm) were used as target stimuli. The control
target was a red circle and the experimental target was a red
duck. A researcher (“cue-giver” or CG) interacted directly
with the infant in a quiet, controlled testing room (4.0 m by
3.6 m). A second researcher (“observer” or OB) monitored
and recorded the infant’s behavioral responses from an
adjacent room. Target cues and locations were given by the
OB to CG using a two-way radio and earpiece. A
metronome was used to accurately time cue-length and
inter-trial intervals. To control the visual scene, the CG
