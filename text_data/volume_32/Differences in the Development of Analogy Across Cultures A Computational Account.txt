accretion approach seems insufficient to explain the
results of the Scene Analogy task (see Richland et al.,

relational representations that must be added by the
modeler. Neither model makes any claims where these
representations, which both models require in order to
reason relationally—and that provide the explanatory
mechanism in the knowledge accretion case—come from

objects attached to random sets of features (chosen from a
pool of 100). We then defined 4 relations (chase, reach-
for, angry-with, and hang-from). Each relation consisted
of two roles, each with three semantic features (e.g., for
the chase relation, both the roles chaser and chased were
each defined by three specific semantic units). Each of the
100 objects was attached to the features of between 1 and
3 relational roles chosen at random. For example, object1
