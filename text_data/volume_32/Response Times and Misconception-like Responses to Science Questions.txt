   Experiment 1 was designed to achieve three goals. The

second was to determine whether this pattern was due to
students’ fundamental inability to compare the slopes of
points on a line, or if it was instead a function of familiarity
with the question context. Finally the third goal was to
compare the response times of students answering correctly
vs. those answering incorrectly to determine if there was a
pattern in response times corresponding to answer choice.                       Electric Potential Graph Condition
   Experiment 1 used a between-subjects design employing
three conditions: math graphs, kinematic graphs, and
electric potential graphs (see Figure 1). Each condition
presented a series of graphs and participants were asked to                                                   At which point is

   In addition to the fact that the series of graphs in the three
conditions were identical (except for the labels on the axes),
the questions posed for each graph are also conceptually
analogous. In particular, the math graph condition asked for
a comparison of the slopes at two points (magnitude of                     Figure 1. Examples of the graphs and questions used in

  Participants were randomly chosen to be placed in each
condition. For the math graphs condition, 28 participants
were chosen from the mechanics course and 49 were chosen
from the electromagnetism course, for a total of 77
participants. For the kinematics graphs condition, 94
participants were chosen from the mechanics class. For the
electric potential graphs condition, 38 students were chosen
from the electromagnetism course.
  Procedure, materials and design All testing was
presented to individual participants on a computer screen in
a quiet room. They proceeded through testing at their own
pace, and their response choices and response times were
electronically recorded.

types were placed in a fixed random order, and this
sequence was presented to all participants in all conditions.
Thus the graphs were mixed such that the correct response
was not always “A”, and not always the lower or higher
point. Our previous pilots studies did not reveal any
significant effects of order of graph type on answering.
Furthermore, Experiment 3 uses a design to counterbalance
for order, with similar results to Experiment 1. Therefore we
are confident that the results here are not an artifact of
question order.
