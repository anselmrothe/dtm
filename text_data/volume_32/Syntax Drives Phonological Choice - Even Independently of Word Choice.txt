                           Introduction
Speakers in all age categories adapt their speech to their
linguistic environment. They order coffee with milk as
‘caffè latte’, ‘cappuccino’ or ‘café au lait’, depending on
what they perceive to be the addressee’s choice and they do
so even if their personal preference would be to use a
different expression (Garrod & Anderson, 1987; Metzing &
Brennan, 2003; Branigan et al., in press). Speakers are also
likely to copy the syntactic structure previously used by
their interlocutor (Levelt & Kelter, 1982; Bock, 1986;
Pickering & Branigan, 1999). Even babies only a few
months old have been observed to use a higher pitch when
interacting with their mother and lower pitch when
interacting with their father (Liberman, 1967) and also older
children appear to adopt the intonation patterns (low/high
boundary tone) when naming pictures, depending on the
tone they previously heard from their dialogue partner                            Figure 1: The Interactive Alignment

Methodology In the baseline condition, twelve drawings
depicting a ditransitive event were presented to 17 Dutch
speakers who were asked to describe the picture using a
monoclausal sentence and a verb they would invent on the
spot. In the experimental conditions, the participants again
engaged in a confederate-steered task during which they
were describing 24 drawings (same as in experiment I and
II) with an invented verb, following a syntactic prime by the
confederate which also involved an invented but Dutch-
sounding verb (with correct morphology). The participants
were being primed alternatively by a monotransitive
construction or a structure with a direct object followed by a
prepositional indirect object, or a structure with a non-
prepositonal indirect object followed by a direct object. The
phonological primes (i.e., the invented verbs) were
