representations, which should result in a high proportion of
mouse stops near landmark values and an overall linear
representation.
   The children, on the other hand, are less likely to be
familiar with landmark values and may struggle to integrate
them into the estimation task. Therefore we suspect that
linear representations will be rare. Although these students,
mostly in fourth grade, should clearly maintain a linear
representation on the number line, we expect that, given the
novelty of this task, they are likely to adopt a logarithmic
representation. Furthermore, we expect there to be clear
differences between adults and children in overall accuracy.
