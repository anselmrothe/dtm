Semantics in the wild: Context-sensitive inferences about mammals

Abstract: Several accounts of semantic representation have relied on a contextually insensitive similarity space,
including recent structured probabilistic approaches (Kemp & Tenenbaum, 2009). However, evidence for these
models relies on participantsâ€™ inferences about a particular kind of property, namely, biological properties. We
show that the training set used to extract a single tree structure by Kemp and Tenenbaum (2009) in fact contains
additional structure in the relations between properties of different types. Moreover, participants who are asked to
make inferences about different kinds of properties (biology, diet, habitat) show generalization differences that reflect
this additional structure. We suggest that models of semantic representation must be able to dynamically adjust
their representations in a context-sensitive manner, and we will present simulation results using a model that can do
so.
