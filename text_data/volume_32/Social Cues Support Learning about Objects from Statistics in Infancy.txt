experiment. Three infants were excluded from final analyses
due to fussiness (i.e., completing only two out of four
blocks). Thirteen infants completed all four blocks; the
remaining 5 infants completed 3 blocks. Infants were
recruited via local-area advertisements and given t-shirts or
bibs to thank them for their participation.
Apparatus Infants’ looks were monitored using a Tobii
1750 eye-tracker (www.tobii.com), and events were
presented on a 17” monitor attached to the eye-tracking unit.
Stimuli were displayed using Tobii’s ClearView AVI
presentation software, and sounds were played through
stereo external speakers. An external video camera on top of
the screen allowed the experimenter to determine whether
the infant was looking at the display. The shape events were
created using Macromedia Director MX 2004, and the
movie clips were assembled using Final Cut Express HD 3                  Figure 1: Shape cluster stimuli and patterns during

trials (consistent or inconsistent) that lasted 12 seconds per
trial (3 splitting events per trial, one event per pattern).
During each familiarization trial, the three shape clusters in
a given pattern were presented sequentially. The training
sequence (Sequence 1 or 2) and presentation side were
counterbalanced across infants. For each infant, the clusters
in the test trials were presented in four orders, which were
counterbalanced with a Latin Square across all infants.
Whether the first test trial displayed an inconsistent or
consistent pattern also was counterbalanced across infants.
Blocks 3 and 4 repeated all familiarization and test trials
from Blocks 1 and 2. Attention getters (still kaleidoscopic
circles or squares with either a “bling” or “boing” sound)
spliced the familiarization and test trials. The 1-second clip
looped until the infants returned their gaze to the screen for
approximately 1500 ms.
Coding The Areas of Interest (AOIs) encompassed slightly
larger areas than those of the frames to account for noisy
infant saccades. For the familiarization trials, total looking
time to the AOI containing the target event was calculated
with Tobii’s ClearView analysis software. For the test trials,
a proportional looking time difference score was calculated
by subtracting the percentage of looking to the inconsistent
events (total looking time to the inconsistent divided by the
total looking time to both test stimuli) from that of the
consistent. A negative score reflected a preference for the
