The results in the hold-out set suggest that the performance
differences in the training set are partly due to a slow initial
learning process of the associative models. Figures 1 (linear
environment) and 2 (multiplicative environment) show that
the linear additive model and the mapping model learn
rather quickly even with as little as 20 learning trials.
However, the two associative models that performed worse
with less than 50 learning trials caught up with the other two
models after extensive learning of 150 trials or more.
   The environment crucially influenced the performance of
the models. Unsurprisingly, in the linear environment, the
linear additive model performed best regardless of the
amount of training. With fewer than 50 learning trials, the             Figure 2: Model performance (RMSD) in the hold-out set
