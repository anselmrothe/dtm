Abstract: Farmer et al. (2006) found that how typical a word’s phonology is of other words in its lexical category
influences the reading times of nouns and verbs in predictive contexts. When a preceding context generated a strong
expectation for a noun, target noun-like nouns were read faster than verb-like nouns, along with a similar effect for
verbs. Further, Dikker et al. (2010) found that the magnitude of the M100 response (sensitive to category-expectation
violations) was modulated by phonological typicality: when a mismatch existed between whether context predicted
a noun and the noun’s degree of typicality, a heightened M100 response occurred in visual cortex. Here, using lexical
decision and a self-paced reading, we examine whether these word-form effects occur in all cases where a noun or verb
is possible, or whether they are more robust when expectations are strong, and thus visual word-form information
may be enough to facilitate categorization.
