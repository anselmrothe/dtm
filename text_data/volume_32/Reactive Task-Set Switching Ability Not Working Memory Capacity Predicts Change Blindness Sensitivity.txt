Reactive Task-Set Switching Ability, Not Working Memory Capacity,
Predicts Change Blindness Sensitivity
Robert Youmans
California State University, Northridge
Abstract: Individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) have long been shown to predict how well
people perform tasks that require directed attention, but other individual differences responsible for task-set switching
and noticing behaviors are less well understood. In this study, students from California State University, Northridge
completed a measure of WMC, a measure of cognitive flexibility, and attempted to identify disappearing objects in
change blindness slides. WMC had no relationship with the other measures, but measures of cognitive flexibility
were directly correlated with the ability to notice change, and no relationships were established. The author argues
that these findings support: 1) new ways of thinking about task-set switching behaviors, and 2) the existence of
individual differences in the ability to notice changes in an environment that are independent of WMC.
