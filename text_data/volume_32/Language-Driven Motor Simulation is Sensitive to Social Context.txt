recipients who were of lower status or close peers, (like
younger siblings, nieces, friends, etc.). Second, the
sentences about transfer to people of high status were
accompanied by grammatical/lexical markers called
honorifics, which indicated that the status of the recipient is
higher than the status of the subject (you). These markers
are present on the recipient noun, the dative case marker,

the most natural and proper way to describe an object

honorific markers and their implications in more detail in
the Discussion section below.) All critical sentences had you
