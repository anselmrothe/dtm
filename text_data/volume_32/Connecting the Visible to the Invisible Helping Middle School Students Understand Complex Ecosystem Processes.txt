behavior function (SBF) approach is useful to explain
dynamic systems with multiple components and levels
(Goel et al., 2009; Liu & Hmelo-Silver, 2009). We view
SBF theory as providing a conceptual representation with
canonical explanations in biological systems, as well as,
being consistent with expert understanding (Bechtel &
Abrahamson, 2005; Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007). In addition
to helping students organize their system knowledge the
SBF representation also provides a scaffold for overall
knowledge organization. The approach helps the learner to
breakdown and distinguish individual parts of the complex
system.
   In a biological system, structure refers to components of
an ecosystem that have form. Structures can be macro (e.g
Fish, plants) or micro (e.g bacteria, fungi) in nature.
Behavior represents the process of how structures achieve
their functions, and, finally, functions are roles the
structures play in an ecosystem.

   It is difficult for learners to understand many aspects of
ecosystems because they have not had opportunities to
engage with those processes that are dynamic and outside
their perceptual understanding. In addition to helping
students organize their system knowledge, the SBF
representation also provides a scaffold for overall
knowledge organization because it helps learners consider
the relationships among form and function as well as the
causal behaviors. We make SBF explicit through the use of
hypermedia, organized in terms of SBF, and through the
Aquarium Construction Toolkit (ACT) (Figure 1a and 1b).
