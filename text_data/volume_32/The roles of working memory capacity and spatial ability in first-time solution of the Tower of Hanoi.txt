Abstract: Decades of research have highlighted the important role of working memory capacity (WMC) in higher
cognition and problem solving. Strangely, the relationship between WMC and the Tower of Hanoi task, a classic
problem in Cognitive Psychology, has yet to be firmly established. Many studies have failed to find the suspected
relationship and those that have identified a relationship have almost universally used spatial-modality measures
of WMC. These results fail to differentiate between whether it was an individualâ€™s WMC or spatial ability that
predicted performance. As such, the goal of the current research was to investigate the complex relationship between
WMC, spatial ability, and the Tower of Hanoi. Results suggest different roles for WMC and spatial ability in the
first-time solution of the Tower of Hanoi.
