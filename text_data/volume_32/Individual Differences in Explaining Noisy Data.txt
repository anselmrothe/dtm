Abstract: In science, we design our inference approaches to trade off fit to observed data (models are good that fit
well) and complexity (models or explanations that fit or explain everything are bad). Here, we examine how observers
balance fit and complexity by asking observers to estimate causal models for noisy data. Specifically, participants are
shown a number of scatterplots that vary in the number of data points shown, the noise added to the true function
and the complexity of the true function. For each set of noisy data points, participants estimate a function which best
captures their guess at the causal explanation between the input and the output. A generative psychological model
combining Bayesian model selection and Gaussian process regression is used to examine individual differences in
biases toward simple explanations. Our results indicate that some participants prefer simple polynomial, rule-based
explanations and others prefer distance-based, similarity explanations.
