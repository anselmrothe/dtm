Behavioral Results
Number comparison is typically characterized by effects of
distance and size on speed and accuracy of judgments
(Moyer & Landauer, 1967). We obtained similar results for
judgments of number line placements. Consistent with
distance effects, log-linear trials, which were closer to the
correct (linear) placements than logarithmic ones, required
more time to solve and resulted in the lowest accuracy rates.
Consistent with size effects, judging the location of large
numbers (i.e. larger than 500) on the number line required
more time than judging the location of small numbers (i.e.
smaller than 500), with accuracy also being lower for
placement of large numbers compared to small numbers.                    Figure 1: Mean d prime values for each numeral (+ SE).
