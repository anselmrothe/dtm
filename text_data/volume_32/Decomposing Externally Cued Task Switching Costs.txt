In Figure 2, the larger circles represent the latent variables,
and the rectangles represent the scores on the individual
indicator tasks that were used to measure each of the latent
variables. The smaller circles represent the residual
variances of the indictor tasks.
   A third factor, task switch, was then introduced to
determine if a task switching process, in addition to
encoding baseline and cue switching, could better explain
individual differences in switch costs. This third factor was
equal to the residual common variance of task switch trials
only. The 3-factor model (please see Figure 3) provided an
excellent fit to the data, χ2(9) = 12.62, p = .181, TLI = .991,
CFI = .998, RMSEA = .040. At first glance, this suggests
that there is an effect of task switching, over and beyond the
processes of cue encoding and cue switching.
   Because the 2-factor and 3-factor models are not nested,
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Expected
Cross-Validation Index (ECVI) were used to compare
overall model fit (Note: unlike the chi-square difference test,
these indices do not provide a statistical comparison of
competing models). In general, a model that has the lowest
AIC and ECVI values is judged to fit the data better than the
alternative model(s) tested (Brown, 2006). For the 2-factor
model, AIC = 106.76 and ECVI = 0.429; for the 3-factor
model, AIC = 102.62 and ECVI = 0.412. In terms of the
AIC and ECVI indices, the 3-factor model best fits the data,        Figure 2: 2-Factor latent variable model to account for
however, the 3-factor model was deemed unacceptable due             switch costs
to non-interpretable and ill-fitting parameter estimates of the
task switch factor. The variance of the task switch factor
was not significant, p = 0.272. Only the path loading for the
task switch trials in the Shapes task to the task switch factor
was significant (β = 0.18, p = 0.015); the path loadings for
the Digits and Verbal tasks were not significant.
   Therefore, the 2-factor model was accepted. The lower
(i.e., better fitting) AIC and ECVI values for the 3-factor
model seem to simply reflect adjustment for model
complexity compared to the 2-factor model, so that the 3-
factor model does not account for any additional systematic
differences in switch costs. The act of task switching does
not provide reliable information that was not already
available from cue switching.
Using Cognitive Measures to Explain Individual
Differences in Task Switching
Further support for this claim comes from additional
modeling of possible cognitive predictors (inhibition and
long-term memory) that might serve to explain some of the
systematic differences in each of the latent factors. Please
see Table 2 for standardized effects and model fits. It should
be noted that because only single indicator predictors are
being employed, the following effects are small, but
significant. Individual differences in inhibition significantly     Figure 3: 3-Factor latent variable model to account for
