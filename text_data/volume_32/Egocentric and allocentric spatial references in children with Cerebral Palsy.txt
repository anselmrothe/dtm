Experimental task
A Distance Judgment Task, adapted from Iachini et al.
(Iachini et al., 2006; Iachini et al., 2009), has been used.
Children were presented with triads of 3D objects in peri-
personal space (within arm reach) and were asked to give
egocentric and allocentric judgments. Materials comprised
eighteen graspable objects divided in triads. They were
geometrical shapes with different colors (e.g., cube,
pyramid, and wheel), animals (e.g., duck, rabbit, and horse),
vehicles (e.g., car, helicopter, and airplane) and everyday
objects (i.e., key, cork and clothes-peg). Objects within
triads had similar size. Each triad was spatially arranged so
that distance between objects was clearly discriminable, and
the amount of metric difficulty was the same for egocentric
and allocentric judgments. Participants sat at 30 cm from the
edge of the desk. Each triad was placed centrally on the
desk and with respect to the participants’ mid-sagittal plane.
A white cardboard measuring 50 x 50 cm was used to                 Overall, both groups of children made few errors in
