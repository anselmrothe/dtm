   Eyetracker calibration was critical for the gaze contingent
aspects of the procedure, as well as to ensure accurate
dependent measures (fixation locations). For this reason,
calibration was checked at 9 locations evenly distributed
across the screen after each search block; fixation position
had to be within 0.75° of visual angle for all points, the
experiment halted and the observer was recalibrated.
Eye movement analysis. Fixations were identified on
smoothed eye position data, averaging the raw data over a
moving window of eight data points (33 ms). Beginning and
end positions of saccades were detected using an algorithm
implementing an acceleration criterion (Araujo, Kowler, &
Pavel, 2001). Specifically, the velocity was calculated for
two overlapping 17 ms intervals; the onset of the second
interval was 4.17 ms after the first. The acceleration
threshold was a velocity change of 6 deg/s between the two
intervals. Saccade onset was defined as the time when
acceleration exceeded threshold and the saccade terminated
when acceleration dropped below threshold. Fixations were
defined as the periods between saccades. Saccades within 50
ms of each other were considered continuous.
Comparative map analysis. Forty eight scenes were
searched by equal numbers of participants in the novel and
repeated conditions. Search trials in the learning and probe
phases, excluding block 1, were combined to yield a
maximum of 7 repeated trials for each observer. The
following experiment conditions correspond to each
