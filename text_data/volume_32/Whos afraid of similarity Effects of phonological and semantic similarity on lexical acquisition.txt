exemplars of a single category, cannot individually define a
category. Nor can a specific set of necessary and sufficient
features define any category, there are always exceptions.
However, the features that consistently co-occur, though not
necessarily in every instance of a category, can define a
category. For example, birds tend to fly, and have feathers,
wings, and beaks. While these features do not always co-
occur (penguins have wings but cannot fly) they frequently
do and are said to coherently covary with one another. As
infants interact in and explore their world they are naturally
exposed to these correlations and regularities. Infants are
sensitive to the coherent covariation and can use these
