the slope of the wall, the length of the route, as well as on
the number, kind, and arrangement of the climbing holds.
Usually climbers, both during their training and during
competitions, spend some time in “studying” climbing
routes before climbing them, especially when they have to
climb a route for the first time. Then, they can mentally
simulate which holds to take, which movements to do,
which rest positions they can find, etc. In some cases, they
also overtly mimic the hand (and foot) movements that they
expect to perform while climbing (see fig. 1).                     Aims and objectives of the study
