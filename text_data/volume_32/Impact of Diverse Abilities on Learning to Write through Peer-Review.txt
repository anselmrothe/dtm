Abstract: Theoretically, there are advantages to working with students of the same ability and different ability (Lou
et al., 1996). In order to determine how students’ ability affects the peer-review process, students’ writing ability
(e.g., high-ability versus low-ability) was first determined. Then students’ were randomly assigned to review either
four high-ability peers’ papers or four low-ability peer’s papers. In return, they received feedback from either four
high-ability peers or four low-ability peers. The quality of students’ second draft of their first paper and the quality of
the first draft of a second paper were analyzed to determine whether students’ learning was affected by the feedback
they provided to high-ability versus low-ability students and by the feedback they received from high-ability versus
low-ability students. In addition, several mediators (e.g., motivation, amount and type of feedback) were examined
to explain the learning differences.
