                  Overview of Design
   The learning environment was simplified by presenting
each subject with an array of 16 novel shapes on a touch
screen display. We selected a touch-screen monitor rather
than a computer mouse because it lends itself to ease of use
for children or other special populations who have limited
mouse experience. Subjects are instructed that they should
learn the names of the shapes by touching them and hearing
that shape’s name. They are told that they can touch shapes
in any order and that they have 64 touches per block. After
each block, they will be tested for their knowledge of shape
names by hearing a name and completing a 16-AFC task.
This alternation of training blocks and testing blocks allows                        Figure 1: An example screen

Task
Training and testing were alternated in a session, with 6
blocks of each, for a total of 12 blocks. Participants were
told to select the items (i.e., touch a shape) in any order they
desired to learn the words that named each of the 16 images
on the screen. They were not told that they would be trained
on the same 16 images and corresponding words in future
blocks. Rather, they were told that each testing block would
correspond to the preceding training block. During each
training block, an on-screen counter marked off the number
of remaining training trials the subject had, from 64 to 0,
until a test block would begin. If the subject had evenly
distributed their touches in a block, they would hear each
word 4 times, which was deemed sufficient for a minimal
level of familiarity but not full mastery after the initial
block. The location of each image was randomized four                       Figure 2: Training selections of high density items

as possible. If they correctly selected an image, the image
turned green. If they selected an incorrect image, the image
turned red; they were not informed of the correct image.
Thus feedback provided the subject with only minimal
information about each decision—whether it was correct—
but not information as to which image was the correct item
if they made an error. Allowing the participant to start each
trial provided the opportunity for short rests as needed
during the testing blocks.
