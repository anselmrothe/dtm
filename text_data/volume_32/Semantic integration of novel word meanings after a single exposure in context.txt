Behavioral performance:
Participants made lexical decisions for words that were
identical, related, or unrelated in meaning to a prime word.
Mean accuracy and RTs are shown in Table 2. We did not
statistically analyze accuracy since accuracy was near
ceiling, with the lowest accuracy in any condition being
93%. For RT, A three factor repeated measures ANOVA on
RT was carried out with factors of Word type (Unknown and
Known) x Constraint (High and Low) x Prime relationship
(Identical, Related and Unrelated). A main effect of Prime
