probability of first occurrence—the probability that a
pattern first occurs at the nth toss, given that the pattern has
not occurred before—can be different for different patterns
(see Figure 1). For example, both patterns THH and HHH
are equally likely to occur or not occur in the first three
tosses. If THH has not occurred before, it will have a
probability of 0.125 to first occur at the 4th toss. In contrast,
if HHH has not occurred before, its probability of first
occurrence at the 4th toss is only 0.0625, half of that for
THH (for a method of calculating the probability of first
occurrence, see Sun, Tweney, & Wang, 2010a). Overall, it
will on average take 14 tosses to observe the first
occurrence of HHH but only take 8 tosses to observe the
first occurrence of THH. Moreover, if we monitor these two
patterns simultaneously, it is more likely that we first
encounter THH than we first encounter HHH (the odds are
7:1). In other words, it appears that the first occurrence of
the streak pattern HHH has been “delayed.”                              Figure 1: Probabilities of first occurrence for patterns

known as waiting time. Compared to the long history of
studies on the gambler’s fallacy (see, Ayton & Fischer,
2004), the development of waiting time and its related
properties is fairly new (see, Gardner, 1988; Graham,                            Mean Time and Waiting Time

respectively. To simplify the discussion, here we only
discuss the case of a fair coin (i.e., pH = pT = ½) and focus
on pattern length r = 3. Unless specified, the discussion in
the following will extend to patterns for all r  3. (A more
general treatment can be found in Sun & Wang, 2010.)
Overlap and Waiting Time
We first note that when generated by an independent
Bernoulli process, a pattern will have a mean time that is the
inverse of its probability of occurrence. Thus, any pattern of
the same length will have the same mean time. For example,
            E THHH   E THTH   E TTHH   1 / 2   8.
                                                        3
However, waiting time can be different for different
patterns. Compared to other patterns of the same length,
streak patterns always have the longest waiting time. For
example,
        E T *HHH   14, E T *HTH   10, and, E T *THH   8.
   Table 1 lists the mean and variance of interarrival time T
and the first arrival time T* for all possible patterns of
length 3. Extra caution should be taken to properly explain
these results. An example is given in Figure 2, which
depicts pattern time in two different contexts where
individual patterns are monitored either independently

with Table 1, we can see that with other factors remaining
constant, the self-overlapping property of a pattern
completely determines the pattern’s waiting time E[T*] and                      A
the variance of interarrival time Var(T). Since a streak
pattern is an uncontaminated run of the same elements, by
such unique composition, a streak pattern will have the
largest amount of self-overlap and consequently, the longest
waiting time.4 As a comparison, non-streak patterns such as
HTH or HHT only have partial self-overlap or no self-
overlap at all so that they will have shorter waiting times.
Moreover, waiting time grows approximately exponentially
as the amount of self-overlap grows. As a consequence, the
difference in waiting time between HHH and HTH is much
greater than that between HTH and HHT.
   The difference in waiting time can be viewed as one type
of precedence relationships in which individual patterns are
monitored independently and only the self-overlap within
each pattern is considered. For example, suppose two                            B
players are betting on two patterns HHH and HHT,
respectively, then each player tosses a coin of her own in
isolation (i.e., the “solitaire game” in Sun, et al., 2010a).
Because of the different waiting time, the player who bets
on HHT will be more likely to get her desired pattern earlier
than the player who bets on HHH.
Inter-overlap and Nontransitivity
The result above might give an impression that pattern HHT
is always more likely to occur earlier than pattern HHH,
thus the gambler’s fallacy might actually have a valid                         Figure 3: Pair-wise precedence in the interplay game and
