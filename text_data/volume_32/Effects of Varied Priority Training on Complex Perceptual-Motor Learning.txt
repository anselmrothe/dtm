The Space Fortress Game
The Space Fortress game was originally developed to study
the acquisition of complex perceptual-motor
                                          motor and cognitive
skills in fast-paced multi-tasking
                             tasking environments (Mane &
Donchin, 1989). The main objective of the game was to
maximize the total scores by shooting missiles at and
destroying the space fortress, while maintaining a spspaceship
within a certain velocity limit and pre-specified
                                          specified boundaries
on the screen. Missiles were fired from the spaceship, whose
movement was controlled by the participant. In addition to
destroying the fortress, the participant had to protect his/her
spaceship
    ceship against damage from the fortress and mine.
Participants used a joystick to control the spaceship.
Forward movement (thrust) of the stick caused the
spaceship to accelerate. Left and right movements caused
the spaceship to rotate counter-clockwise

respectively. Because the spaceship flied in a frictionless
environment, it would continue to fly in the direction to
which it was pointing unless it was rotated and a thrust was
applied. In that case, the spaceship would change its                   Figure 1: Cognitive task analysis of the Space Fortress game.
