Abstract: We studied the influence on memory of three temporal schedules of repetitions of vocabulary pairs. Pairs
were presented on Day 1, 7, and 13 in a Uniform schedule; on Day 1, 2, and 13 in an Expanding schedule; and on
Day 1, 12, and 13 in a Contracting schedule, with schedule as a within-subject factor. Retention was tested with
a cued-recall task performed on Day 15, 19 (Experiment 1), or 26 (Experiment 2). Cued recall did not differ as a
function of the schedule on Day 15, whereas the Expanding schedule led to the best performance on Day 19 and
26. We interpreted this new finding of a modulation of the effect of schedule as a function of the retention interval
within the frame of a model based on the study-phase retrieval theory that accounts for different forgetting curves
for different schedules.
