either located at the right side of the cladogram (vertical
orientation, Figure 1) or at the top of the cladogram
(horizontal orientation, Figure 2). The second factor was the
rotation of the branches of the cladogram. The branches
were rotated, without altering the depicted relationships
(i.e., the underlying topology), so that the focal taxon was
located either at the end (far right or top, depending on the
orientation; see Figure 1) or at the center position (see
Figure 2). In Rotation Set 1, human was located at the end
position whereas the honeybee was in the middle. In
Rotation Set 2, the human was in the middle and honeybee
was at the end. Rotation set was manipulated between
subjects. We fully counterbalanced the orientation and

the four possible combinations).
