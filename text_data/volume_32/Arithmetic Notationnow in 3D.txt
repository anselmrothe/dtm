unlike in the stimuli in Figure 1, in some cases low-
precedence operations afford more immediate action than
high-precedence operations. This issue is taken up again in
Experiment 3.
   Another reason to expect systematic biases in perceived
depth of arithmetic signs comes from the salience structure
of those signs. As mentioned above, typical multiplication
signs (the dot and the cross) are more salient and readily
attended than addition signs. Salience and attention present
conflicting pressures in the paradigm employed here.
Voluntary attention has been shown to influence the
perceived depth of ambiguous figures (Kawabata, 1986). In
the case of arithmetic expressions, attention shifts
systematically from high-precedence operations to low-
precedence over the course of problem solution. Since
participants made depth judgments after solving the
problem, attention would most recently have been primarily            Figure 2: Results of Experiments. Errors represent 95%
