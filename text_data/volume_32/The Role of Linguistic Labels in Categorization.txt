   Similar to Yamauchi and A. Markman, there are two
levels of similarity (or feature match) in current research:
high and low. At the high level of feature match, each test
stimulus has four features in common with the prototype
of the corresponding category and one feature in common
                                                                      Proportion of category-
with the prototype of the contrasting category. Similarly,
each test stimulus at the low level of feature match has
two features in common with the prototype of the
corresponding category and three features in common
                                                                       accordance responses
with the prototype of the other category.
Procedure The entire experiment consisted of two
phases, learning and testing. During the learning phase,
participants were instructed that they should try to
remember and distinguish two groups of artificial
creatures represented by the labels "Flurp" and "Jalet".
And then participants were presented with 36 trials of                                            Feature Match
