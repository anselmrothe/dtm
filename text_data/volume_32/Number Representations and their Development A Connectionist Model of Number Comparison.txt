favored a power function, Verguts et al. (2005) adopted a
closely related exponential function. To facilitate the
comparison of our results, we formed training comparisons
by sampling pairs of numbers from an exponentially
decreasing distribution (where the frequency of number i is
       ). The distribution of individual numbers and of
comparisons (as a function of distance) is shown in Figure
2.
   Non-naturalistic training environments were constructed
by assuming that numbers are distributed uniformly in the
environment. Training comparisons were formed by
sampling from this distribution. The results are also shown
in Figure 2.
   It is interesting that naturalistic and non-naturalistic
training environments result in strikingly similar
distributions of comparisons as a function of distance.
However, as we shall see, these environments have

resulting models to account for the adult distance and size                   Figure 3: Distance effects for the four models.

to extend the range of the models considered here to new

   Although the developmental model produced changes in
error rates and comparison speed that parallel human data,
further work is necessary to more completely model the
development of number comparison. In particular, the
model needs to account for the more pronounced distance
effect of younger participants reported by Sekuler and
Mierkiewicz. One reason our model may have failed to
capture this trend is that we trained the model using
distributions based on the occurrence of numbers in adult
language. One approach to improving the developmental
simulations may be to use training data that parallel the
distributions of numbers in children’s and child-directed
speech.
