Abstract: We present statistical analyses of the small world properties for two particular types of episodic graphs.
One is from the paragraph space of the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and the other is from images collected
as subjects engaged in their activities of daily living. We show that they have a small-world structure which is
characterized by sparse connectivity, short average path lengths between nodes, and high global clustering coefficient.
However, the degree distribution analyses show that they are not scale-free graphs. For the analyses, we selected
edges from different proportions to construct the networks, hence, a series of analyses reveal the growth style of these
two episodic graphs.
