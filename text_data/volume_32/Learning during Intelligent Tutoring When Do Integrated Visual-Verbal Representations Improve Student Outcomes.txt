   One way to support novice learning in geometry, then,
may be to scaffold student interactions with visual
representations in a way that improves their understanding
of the relationship between visual features of geometry
problems (i.e., geometry diagrams) and the geometry
principles/rules used in problem solving. In geometry,
problem solving requires that learners connect meaningful
diagram configurations to relevant geometry principles. For
example, in Figures 2 and 3, angle ABC is an interior angle,
same side to angle BCD. Learners should recognize that the
diagram contains two parallel lines (AB, DC) intersected by
a transversal (BC). Angles ABC and BCD are on the
interior of the parallel lines, and on the same side of the
transversal. Thus, they are interior angles, same side and
can be solved using this rule. In this study, we used

interactions that emphasize diagram-domain mappings
during problem-solving practice can improve learning more
than interactions that build integrated visual-verbal
representations (cf., Butcher & Aleven, 2007, 2008).
   The purpose of this study was to explore the potential
benefits of providing students with integrated
representations that emphasized the mapping between
diagram elements and domain information during intelligent
tutoring vs. requiring students to generate these integrated
representations. Both conditions were compared to a control
condition in which students interacted with diagrams to
embed numerical information into the diagrams (i.e., student
interactions     created     an    integrated,    visual-verbal
representation that did not emphasize domain connections).

Student-Highlighting Condition The purpose of the
student highlighting condition was to require student
interactions with the intelligent tutor that generated
integrated diagram-domain representations during problem-
solving practice in the Cognitive Tutor. In this condition, if
a student entered an incorrect answer or reason during
practice, s/he was locked out of the numerical answer field
until s/he identified the correct geometry principle needed to
solve the problem-solving step. Once the correct principle
was identified, students highlighted the diagram features
relevant to that principle (see Figure 2). These highlights
created an integrated diagram-domain representation of the
problem situation. As seen in Figure 2, highlighting was
scaffolded by a list of diagram features that appeared after
students entered a correct geometry principle for a problem-
solving step. Students were required to highlight each              Figure 3: Tutor-highlighted diagram following student error
