   After every 10 snapshots participants were asked to guess
which of the possible links were true. They were shown the
picture in Figure 2 but with no links darkened, and told to
click on the links to make their guess. Links darkened when
selected. To assist with learning, participants were given
indirect feedback regarding their link choices starting on
their 4th hypothesis trial (after 40 snapshots)1. They were
never told the status of any particular link choice (e.g., that
the A.B link was right or wrong). Instead, they were told
that the hypothesis was VERY GOOD, GOOD, WEAK, or
VERY WEAK, indicating that 5, 4, [3 or 2], [1 or 0] links
were correct, respectively. Participants were not told the
correspondences between the feedback and number of
accurate links. On the final hypothesis, participants were
told, “This is your LAST PREDICTION. On the next trial,
make your best guess as to what causes what.”
   Finally, in the target likelihood rating phase, participants
again rated the likelihood of all possible snapshots of the
ecosystem but this time with nodes A-D.
   No-change condition: The no-change condition was
identical to the change condition, but the prior learning
phase and the prior likelihood ratings phase were excluded.
The instructions immediately introduced participants to all
four aspects of the ecosystem and the five possible links.
Participants then began the target learning phase.
