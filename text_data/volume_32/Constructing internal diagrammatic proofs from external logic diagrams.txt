representations are completely different from users’ point of
view (see Zhang & Norman, 1994; Scaife & Rogers, 1996).
   The efﬁcacy of logic diagrams has been investigated in the
context of the studies of logic teaching method (Stenning,
1999; 2002; Dobson, 1999). In these studies, subjects are
provided with substantial training in ways of manipulating
diagrams. In contrast to this, our interest is in the question
whether diagrams can be useful for those who are not trained
in rules or strategies of diagrammatic deductive reasoning.
This question is important because, in contrast to logical for-
