The issue of intended meaning is an open problem in the                      [state of aff. 1      state of aff. 2       state of aff. n] interest

Kripke, 1979; Sperber & Wilson, 1986; Clark, 1996;
Recanati, 2001; Bach, 2004; Bianchi, 2006). In this paper
I present a notion of intended meaning based on the
notion of speaker’s preference for a state of affairs to                      [interpret.1           interpret. 2         interpret. n] context
which a sentence refers. This notion derives from the
analysis of negotiation processes and the determination of
meaning in linguistic controversies provoked by
ambiguous clauses in contracts. The paper’s contribution
to the notion of intended meaning is based on the                                                         sentence
