                          Introduction
Reasoning with spatial information requires sometimes to                                                   N
reason with incomplete information. Take for example,                                             NW              NE
                     Berlin is north-east of Paris.
                     Paris is north-west of Rome.                                                W         EQ        E
   You can (based on this information alone, e.g. no back-
ground knowledge, no map) easily infer that Berlin must be
north of Rome. But you cannot infer (based on this informa-                                       SW              SE

          Preferences in Cardinal Direction
The language of cardinal direction consists of points in the
euclidean plane R2 . Based on the point algebra it is possible
to distinguish 9 base relations a, b ∈ R2 :
      CD EQ      N    NE     E     SE    S    SW     W    NW
      PA (=,=) (=,>) (>,>) (>,=) (>,<) (=,<) (>,<) (<,=) (>,>)
    In other words a N b := ax = bx ∧ ay > by , b is a northly.
