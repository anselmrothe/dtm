Abstract: Recent research suggests the way our body is situated influences how we perceive our environment (Lopez
et al., 2009), but it remains unclear whether our body’s position influences how we process faces when retinal cues
are kept constant (Troje, 2003; Lobmaier & Mast, 2007). In this study, participants completed an old/new face
memory task in three different body positions (sitting upright, lying right, and lying left) and four different image
orientations (upright, inverted, 90 degrees clockwise, and 90 degrees counterclockwise), allowing us to isolate the
effects of retinal versus gravitational face orientation on recognition memory. We found a main effect of retinal face
orientation, with higher d’ to faces oriented upright versus inverted with respect to participants’ retinas. Keeping
retinal orientation constant, we also found an effect of gravitational orientation, with higher d’ to faces orientated
upright with respect to gravity, indicating a role of gravitational orientation in face processing.
