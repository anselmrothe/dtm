lieve that trying to understand these biases is fertile ground
for future research. For cognitive development, the idea that
children are more flexible in their commitments about the
way that causal systems tend to work seems like not just a
necessary consequence of a hierarchical Bayesian approach,
but an important insight for understanding how it is that chil-
dren see the world differently from adults. The plasticity of
beliefs that this implies helps to explain the bold exploration
