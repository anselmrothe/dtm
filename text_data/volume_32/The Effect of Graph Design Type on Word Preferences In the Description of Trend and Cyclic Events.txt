Abstract: This study was conducted as a part of larger study on the effect of graph type on trend and cyclic event
comprehension. It aims to present the analysis of subjectsâ€™ word preferences in the verbal description of trend and
cyclic events, given different graph types (linear, round). For this purpose, a novel round graph type was designed.
For instance, while in the linear graph timeline for a year, January is located on the left and December on the right
side, in the round graph, January and December are located adjacently. As a data collection tool, verbal description
task and evaluation forms were used. 40 university students participated in this study.
   The results revealed that, although the graph type has no significant effect, the event type conveyed by them
modulates word preferences (ex. usage of trend, discrete, and conceptual words) in the description of relations
among elements depicted in the graph.
