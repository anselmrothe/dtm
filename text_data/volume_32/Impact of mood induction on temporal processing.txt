Abstract

premise for this subjective temporal bias. After
mood induction, participants evaluated the
duration of neutrally valenced faces.
We
hypothesized that participants in valenced
moods would overestimate the duration of these
neutral events, supporting the impact of
embodied emotions on subjective temporal
perception.

The durations of negative events are
overestimated when compared to the actual
amount of time passed (Langer, et al, 1961;
Meck, 1983). Similarly, emotionally valenced
faces are temporally overestimated when
compared to neutral ones (Droit-Volet, Bruno, &
Niedenthal, 2004). In the current study,
participants embodied emotion via mood
induction prior to temporal estimation of
neutrally valenced faces. Valenced mood
induction led to overestimation of the duration
of neutral faces. Results support the claim that
embodiment of emotion can cause subjective
temporal distortion.

The Scalar Theory of Timing
A predominant theory of timing is the
scalar timing theory (Gibbon, 1977) which
comprises two fundamental properties: (1) the
internal clock is, on average, accurate in
estimating stimulus durations, and (2) the greater
the mean duration of time has passed, the larger
the variability of the internal clock’s estimation.
Three stages are outlined in scalar timing theory:
(1) the clock stage, (2) the memory stage, and
(3) the decision stage. During the clock stage, a
pacemaker emits pulses that are stored in an
accumulator, with more pulses representing
longer durations. The accumulator is opened or
closed with a mode switch, allowing specific
events to be separated for temporal estimation.
Once event timing is complete, the contents of
the accumulator are stored for later use in the
decision stage in working memory, where they
are compared to previously experienced
durations stored in long-term memory. The
decision stage allows for appraisal of relative
values in order to make an assessment of time.
In this scalar model of timing, an
attentional
system—which
can
allocate
differential resources to incoming stimuli based
on perceived importance—is added to the modal
switch of the clock phase, helping explain
erroneous time estimation. While scalar timing
theory posits that the internal clock is generally
accurate, over and under-estimation of time does
occur. For example, previous research suggests

Introduction
Several movies, advertisements, and
societal icons portray the old adage, ‘Time flies
when you are having fun’, but only recently did
science begin investigating the legitimacy of this
statement. Does subjective experience of
duration really change when in emotionally
valenced situations? Experiencing emotional
events such as foot shocks (Meck, 1983) and
approaching threatening stimuli (Langer, et al.,
1961) results in overestimation of event
duration, implying that subjective experience of
time speeds up when participating in negative
events. Simply put, negative situations produce
the feeling of more time going by than has
actually passed.
The current paper investigates the
impact of emotions on temporal perception and
the scalar theory of timing (Gibbon, 1977). Past
research has found that humans overestimate the
duration of emotionally valenced faces (DroitVolet, Bruno, & Niedenthal, 2004), and the
current study evaluates an embodied emotion

that attentional distraction can either delay the
mode switch closing or prematurely open it,
resulting in a net loss of pacemaker pulses. This
loss results in an underestimation of time
(Buhusi & Meck, 2006; Coull, et al., 2004;
Lejeune, 1998; Macar, 2002; Meck &
MacDonald, 2007).

arousal, negative stimuli being overestimated
when compared to high arousal, positive stimuli
(Angrilli, et al., 1997). The relationship is
reversed when low arousal stimuli are presented,
with the duration of negative stimuli being
underestimated when compared to positive
stimuli (Angrilli, et al., 1997). Finally, the
durations of emotionally valenced faces (i.e.
angry, happy, and sad) are significantly
overestimated when compared to neutral faces in
a duration bisection task (Droit-Volet, et al.,
2004). These results are consistent with those of
Schiff and Thayer (1970), who found that
perceived duration of forced eye contact with an
angry face was significantly longer than
perceived duration of eye contact with a neutral
face.
Together, these findings suggest that
emotional stimuli, events, and faces impact the
speed of the pacemaker invoked by scalar timing
theory. Other research suggests that the impact
of emotional faces on temporal processing may
also involve embodied cognition of perceived
emotion.

Effects of Emotion on Attention and Timing
Emotional salience can significantly
impact attentional priority, with highly
emotional stimuli directing both conscious and
unconscious attention away from neutral stimuli
(Taylor & Fragopanagos, 2005). Emotional
stimuli have been shown to: (a) be detected
faster and more accurately than neutral stimuli,
regardless of the number of distracters (Ohman,
Flykt, & Esteves, 2001), (b) remain more
detectable within an attentional blink paradigm,
even persisting past the point at which neutral
stimuli become minimally detected (Anderson &
Phelps, 2001), and (c) capture automatic
attention earlier than neutral stimuli when
measured by event-related potentials (Carretie et
al., 2004). Furthermore, affective priming’s
impact on emotional judgment (Murphy &
Zajonc, 1993) and amygdala activation of
backwards-masked emotional stimuli (Whalen,
et al., 1998) also demonstrate how both detected
and undetected emotional stimuli impact
cognitive and neural processes involved with
attention.
Recent
findings
have
provided
substantial evidence that emotions also impact
temporal processing by causing overestimation
of the duration of emotional: (a) events (Langer,
et al., 1961; Meck, 1983; Stetson, Fiesta, &
Eagleman, 2007), (b) faces (Droit-Volet, Brunot,
& Niedenthal, 2004, Gil, Niedenthal, & DroitVolet, 2007), and (c) other stimuli (Angrilli, et
al., 1997; Noulhiane, et al., 2007). When
experiencing stressful events, such as foot
shocks (Meck, 1983), approaching threatening
stimuli (Langer, et al., 1961), and forcing eye
contact with an angry face (Schiff & Thayer,
1970), higher arousal level is hypothesized to
increase the pacemaker’s speed, thereby
impacting the number of pulses acquired in the
accumulator. In addition, a significant
interaction between emotional valence and
arousal has been found, with the duration of high

Embodiment of Emotion
Viewing emotional events, stimuli and
faces similarly affect temporal processing, but a
remaining question is whether the experience
(embodiment) of emotions affects temporal
estimates of neutrally valenced stimuli. Studies
suggest that embodiment of emotions occurs
when exposed to valenced faces (Chambon et
al., 2008; Effron, et al., 2006). Embodiment of
other groups’ physiological behavior has been
demonstrated by Bargh, et al (1996) with
participants: (a) walking slower when exposed
to elderly stereotype words in a word search, and
(b) being more likely to interrupt when exposed
to rude stereotype words. Similarly, Chambon,
et al. (2008) hypothesized slowing down of the
internal clock speed when exposed to elderly
faces versus younger faces. Effron, et al. (2006)
investigated if an embodied cognition approach
could specifically explain the impact of
emotional facial stimuli on temporal processing;
indeed, inhibiting imitation of viewed facial
expressions (by having participants hold a pen
between
their
lips)
eliminated
any
overestimation of the duration of valenced faces.
These results suggest that imitation of facial

1460

expression may influence timing processes,
though additional evidence for the role of
embodied emotion on temporal processing is
needed.
The current study will thus further
investigate the role of embodied cognition
through evaluation of the implication set forth
by Effron, et al. (2006). If perceived mood is
embodied, and as such impacts temporal
perception, similar effects should be seen when
mood is induced and neutral stimuli are
evaluated as when valenced stimuli are
evaluated in a neutral mood. Induction of
positive, negative and neutral moods was
utilized to determine whether emotionally
valenced mood leads to duration overestimation
of neutral faces similar to the effect seen when
timing valenced stimuli. If overestimation of
neutral facial stimuli were found for those in a
positive and negative mood, compared to
participants in a neutral mood, results would
indicate that subjective temporal distortion could
occur via embodiment of emotion. The current
study also evaluated the influence of emotion on
the scalar timing theory, specifically the impact
of emotional arousal and attention prioritization.
Differences in point of subjective equality
between moods revealed a bias shift, seen in
previous literature, implicating an increase in
pacemaker speed during emotionally arousing
situations. Furthermore, attentional prioritization
of any emotional stimuli used in previous
studies was decreased through the use of neutral
stimuli in this study, thereby allowing for the
exclusive analysis of embodied emotional
arousal on temporal perception.

inch monitor in a dimly lit room. Participants
sat approximately 45 cm from the display. The
task stimuli were presented and data were
recorded using E-prime, and participants made
all responses using a keyboard. The stimulus
presented for the practice trials was a white oval
(9 x 10 cm) similar to that used by Droit-Volet,
et al. (2004). One photo of a female face with a
neutral expression, which had been coded using
the Facial Action Coding System (Tracy, et.al.,
2009), was used for the testing trials (44x .32
cm).
Procedure
Before the bisection task, a mood
induction procedure was run in which each
participant was presented with a series of either
positive (n = 25), negative (n = 24), or neutral (n
= 35) Velten statements (Velten, 1968) that
progressed automatically on the computer screen
over the course of 8 minutes. Participants were
instructed to “read each and think about them as
if you were experiencing them.” This procedure
has been used to induce both positive and
negative moods in many previous studies
(Jennings, et al., 2000; Sinclair, et al., 1994;
Strickland, et al.1974).
Immediately following the mood
induction, participants completed a temporal
bisection task similar to the one used in DroitVolet et al. (2004) with two trial phases: (1)
practice, and (2) testing. Participants pressed the
space bar to initiate each trial. In the practice
phase, a white oval was presented for the longest
(1600 ms) and shortest (400 ms) durations.
Participants had to press the ‘d’ key if the
duration was closer to 400 ms or the ‘k’ key if
the duration was closer to 1600 ms. Each
stimulus was presented 8 times, for a total of 16
trials. Accuracy feedback was given after each
trial; positive feedback consisted of ‘Correct!’
displayed visually for 1500ms, while negative
feedback consisted of ‘Incorrect’ displayed
visually for 1500ms. Participants were then
instructed to press the spacebar to begin the next
trial. In the testing phase, participants were
presented with a neutral face rather than a white
oval as the stimulus to be timed, and feedback
was eliminated. This face was presented for 18
trials each at each of 7 durations in random
order, including the shortest and longest
durations from the training phase and various

intermediate durations (400, 600, 800, 1000,
1200, 1400, and 1600 ms) for a total of 126
trials.

As evidenced in Figure 1, this produces a
leftward shift for the psychophysical functions
of participants in valenced moods compared
with neutral moods, and results in a bias to
respond ‘long’.

Results
For the training phase, participants in all
mood conditions demonstrated accuracy on the
bisection task prior to starting the test trials
(neutral = 91.67%, positive = 98.43%, negative
= 93.75%). For the testing phase, the mean
proportion of long responses was calculated for
each stimulus duration and separated by mood
condition (see Figure 1).
To evaluate any significant differences
between groups, a non-linear regression analysis
was performed [model: Y=1/(1+[x/T50]^-E)]
followed by a statistical comparison of the
slopes (E) and subjective mid-point (T50) using
a student’s t-test. No significant differences
between slope were found across groups. The
following significant differences between
subjective mid-point (T50)—the stimulus
duration that the participant is equally like to
categorize as ‘short’ or ‘long’--were found: (a)
those in a positive mood had a significantly
lower T50 than those in a neutral mood (t (15) =
-4.414; p <.01; positive: T50 = 893; neutral: T50
= 948.6), and (b) those in a negative mood had a
significantly lower T 50 than those in a neutral
mood (t (21) = -3.187; p <.01; negative: T50 =
904.8; neutral: T50 = 948.6). Thus, lower points
of subjective equality were found in the positive
and negative mood groups, as compared with the
neutral mood group, supporting the premise that
induction
of
valenced
moods
causes
overestimation of the duration of neutral events.

Discussion
The present findings replicate the effect
of emotion on temporal perception found by
Droit-Volet, et al. (2004) with emotionally
valenced mood causing overestimation of
neutral stimuli duration compared to duration
estimation in neutral moods. The current use of
mood induction, instead of emotional stimuli,
supports the claims set forth by Effron et al.
(2006) outlining the embodiment of perceived
emotion significantly impacting temporal
perception. The impact of experienced mood on
temporal perception being identical to the
impact of observed mood on temporal
perception endorses the idea that embodying
perceived emotion causes temporal bias when
judging stimulus duration.
The current findings also speak to the
influence of arousal on the scalar timing theory
by illustrating a significant difference in point of
subjective equality as well as no significant
difference in sensitivity – slope- between
groups. The use of neutrally valenced stimuli, as
well as no slope differences between groups,
indicates little if any impact of attentional
demands on temporal perception. Furthermore,
significant differences in point of subjective
equality supports previous findings that arousal
can impact pacemaker speed (Droit-Volet, et al.,
2004; Gil & Droit-Volet, 2009). Positive and
negative moods increase arousal levels, thereby
causing faster pulse emission from the
pacemaker and resulting in longer subjective
judgment of time passed. Overall, in conjunction
with previous research examining the effects of
emotionally valenced stimuli on temporal
perception, the current findings: (a) reveal the
same impact via valenced mood induction on
timing of neutral stimuli, and (b) suggest that

1462

embodiment of emotions may distort temporal
perception via increased arousal.
A body of research on depression and
temporal perception suggests that the slowing of
pacemaker speed in depressed individuals causes
time to pass subjectively slower and
underestimation of time (Blewett, 1992; Gil &
Droit-Volet, 2009). There is a deceleration of
general motor function in depression (Lemke, et
al., 2000), however, manifested in reports of
helplessness and resignation and not seen in
non-depressed patients in a sad mood. This
difference in motor function speed could
account for the disparity in temporal perception
in depressed and non-depressed patients.
Regardless, differences in temporal perception
between clinical populations with affective
disorders (i.e. depression, bi-polar disorder)
should be further addressed in future research.
Whether temporary valenced mood
increases pacemaker speed or depression slows
it, both support the idea that embodiment of
emotions can drive temporal biases. When
imitation of viewed facial expression is
inhibited, for example, stimulus valence fails to
impact temporal perception, suggesting that
merely perceiving emotions in others is not
sufficient to impact timing (Effron et al., 2006).
The current finding that temporary mood
induction produces the same effect on temporal
perception as perceived mood further supports
the claim that embodiment of emotions may play
a mechanistic role in the influence of valence on
timing.
