extremely low in comparison to other relevant parame-
ters (default ptr, cost and benefit of cooperation, etc.).
   In figure 3 we show the proportion of cooperative in-
teractions as the cost of cognition increases. Although
the change in cooperation is not as drastic as the changes
in strategy distribution, it is still statistically significant.
In particular, we observe the same phase transition, with
proportion of cooperative interactions stable around .955
while k ≤ .0035 and stable around .915 when k ≥ .0065.
The counter-intuitive result in figure 3 is that as hu-
manitarian agents start to dominate the population, the
proportion of cooperation decreases. This raises the im-
portant question of what is more important: overall co-
operation or the individual fairness of predominantly hu-
manitarian agents?
   For contrast, we also present two figures of strategy                                     (b) k = .007

This supports the intuition that ethnocentrics are better
at suppressing selfish agents.

although the exact quantitative aspects change. As in
