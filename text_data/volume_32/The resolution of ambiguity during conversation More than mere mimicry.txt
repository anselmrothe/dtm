Participants. Participants included 23 University of

American English with normal to corrected vision and no
reports of hearing/speech impairments.
Materials. The experiment took place in a private
laboratory room. Participants were seated at a comfortable
distance from a 20-inch iMac computer screen. A headset
with microphone was used to present and record acoustic
data.    MATLAB PsychToolbox-3 programs (Brainard,
