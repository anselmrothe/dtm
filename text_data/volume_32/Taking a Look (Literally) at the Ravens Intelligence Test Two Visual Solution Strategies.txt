matrix problem that is similar to one in the Standard
Progressive Matrices (SPM); other problems contain 3x3
matrices. The entire SPM consists of 60 problems divided
into five sets of 12 problems each (sets A, B, C, D & E),
roughly increasing in difficulty both within and across sets.
  Although the Raven’s tests are supposed to measure only
eductive ability, or the ability to extract and understand
information from a complex situation (Raven, Raven, &
Court 1998), their high level of correlation with other multi-
domain intelligence tests have given them a position of
centrality in the space of psychometric measures (e.g. Snow,
Kyllonen, & Marshalek 1984), and as a result, they are often
used as tests of general intelligence in clinical, educational,
vocational, and scientific settings.
