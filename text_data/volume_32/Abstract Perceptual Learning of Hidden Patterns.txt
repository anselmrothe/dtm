Abstract: ’Perceptual learning’ (PL) refers to experience induced improvements in the extraction of information
from the environment. Although early work emphasized that PL often involved discovery of abstract invariants from
stimulation (Gibson, 1969), most recent work has focused on concrete, low level stimulus properties. We describe
research to understand abstract perceptual learning (APL), which requires discovery of structural relations between
features, and compare it to concrete PL. Learners discovered hidden targets – 10 squares of the same luminance
embedded in 12x12 ’grids’ of varying luminance noise. Concrete targets maintained pixel position and luminance
across trials. Abstract targets changed either position or luminance across trials. In a discovery task, humans were
able to discover both concrete and abstract patterns. We show that existing computational models can describe
concrete but not abstract learning and we suggest models that can account for abstraction in PL.
