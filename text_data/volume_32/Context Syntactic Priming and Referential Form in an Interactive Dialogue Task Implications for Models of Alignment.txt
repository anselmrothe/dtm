Materials and Methods
Participants Seventeen pairs of friends from the University
of Rochester were paid to participate. All were native
English speakers who had not taken part in the first

Experimental Setup and Items The setup was the same as
for the first experiment, with a few notable changes. First,
primes were now divided into two new categories,
depending on dialogue status. Dialogue primes involved one
participant describing a prime display to her partner; this
was followed by the other participant describing a response
display. For one third of trials, non-dialogue primes that had
been pre-recorded by a trained female speaker were played                 Figure 4: The proportion (standard error) of prime-
