  A central idea in many successful models of category
  learning—including the Generalized Context Model
  (GCM)—is that people selectively attend to those
  dimensions of stimuli that are relevant for dividing                               8                          2

  some previously analyzed category learning data, but

  Rather than concluding that people attend to both di-

that people give significant attention to both dimensions,
although they are probably focusing a little more on the
