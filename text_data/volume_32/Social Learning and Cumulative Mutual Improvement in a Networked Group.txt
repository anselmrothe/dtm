these effects would be more pronounced in the invisible-

for participants (including successful asocial learners) in the

easily take advantage of good solutions found by others
through selective imitation and further improve upon them.
                          Methods
   Participants were recruited from the Indiana University
Psychological        and    Brain     Sciences      Department
undergraduate subject pool, and were given course credit for
taking part in the study. Participants populated each session
by signing up at will for scheduled experiments with a
maximum capacity of 9 persons. 234 individuals
participated in the experiment, distributed across 65 sessions
as shown in Table 1.

improved from the previous round, the numerical score
display counted up to the new score and turned green, and if
it had worsened, the display counted down to the new score
and turned red. At the end of each game, the display showed
the player's final score, along with a table of the scores of
each player in each round of the game, sorted by average
score. The player's own score was highlighted to show their
relative performance without placing competitive emphasis
on it. Players were instructed to do their best to maximize
their teams' scores over all 24 rounds. At the beginning of
each game, each player's team was a random selection of
creature icons from the league. Each group played 6 games;
in 3 of the games, other participants’ scores were visible,
and in the other 3 they were not. These were called the
visible-scores and invisible-scores conditions, respectively,
and were played in random order in each session.
   In each game, each icon was associated with a certain
positive number of points, and several special pairs of icons           Figure 2: Distribution of scores for all possible teams.
