Development of the Semantic Network: From a random to a complex
network

Abstract: In the present study, we investigate semantic knowledge of both adults and children for early learned
words. Previous studies have suggested that semantic knowledge forms a network with particular properties, called
a complex network. Since, in theory, a particular kind of network structure may be generated by a particular
process, the structure of the semantic knowledge network found in semantic tasks has been supposed to reflect the
developmental process of semantic knowledge acquisition. However, at this point, no empirical description is available
for the development of children’s knowledge –adult substitutes are used. We investigate children’s semantic knowledge
using an alternative-forced-choice association task. The result suggests that the children’s semantic network is closely
approximated by a random network which is different from adults’ network. However, it is not truly random but
contains a reliable structure. We discuss a possible developmental trajectory from a children’s random-like network
to an adult’s complex network.
