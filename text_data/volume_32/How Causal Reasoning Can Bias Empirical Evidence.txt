causal structures, the instructions were completely silent on
whether one should assume the Markov condition. Hence,
this provides a test for whether participants implicitly as-
serted the Markov condition and distorted the empirical
probabilities accordingly.
   Like in Condition 2 of Experiment 1 there were eight suc-
cessive learning phases showing all three events A, B, and
C. Again participants were focused on the respective direct
causal relationship by the instructions and a circling of the
directly related events. The data patterns were randomized
within each learning phase; the learning data was identical
in all conditions (Table 2).
