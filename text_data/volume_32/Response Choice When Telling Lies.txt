Abstract: It is commonly believed that telling a lie is more difficult than telling the truth. However, the precise
reason for this difficulty remains uncertain. The Activation-Decision-Construction Model (ADCM; Walczyk, Roper,
Seemann & Humphrey, 2003) suggests that telling a lie will take longer than telling the truth due to the additional
processes involved, such as suppression of the truth. Experimental work investigated the lie construction component
of the model by manipulating the number of plausible lie responses available. Participants lied and told the truth
regarding the colour of a square presented on a computer screen. Results support the general claims of the ADCM,
but suggest that longer response times when individuals lie to questions with more than one possible lie response
relate to a fixed cost choice between multiple response possibilities. This contributes to current understanding of
which situations may enhance processing differences between telling a lie and telling the truth.
