Abstract: The present research implements a more human-like system of language in a humanoid robot model
through improved use of grammatical constructions in described events. The present demonstrations show how the
iCub humanoid robot is taught to recognize and use verb tense and aspect more appropriately. While hearing spoken
verbal descriptions and watching visual displays of simple events involving objects moving on a table, the iCub
robot begins to link the correct grammatical constructions with the appropriate information from its visual inputs
and perceptual primitives. Thus, when it views a scene, the iCub robot is more likely to use the correct linguistic
constructions to accurately describe it. In this way, past events are accurately described in the past tense, whereas
ongoing events are described in the present progressive. Experimental evidence shows increased accuracy of scene
descriptions for the iCub humanoid robot after learning phases involving live human-robot interactions. Supported
by FP7 CHRIS & Organic, and ANR Comprendre and Amorces.
