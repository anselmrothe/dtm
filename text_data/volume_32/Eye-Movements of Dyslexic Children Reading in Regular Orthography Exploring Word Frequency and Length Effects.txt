(F2(1, 59) = 6.02, p < 0.05) and marginally significant in the
subjects analysis (F1(1, 12) = 4.44, p = 0.057). Longer (8-

significant in the subjects and in the items analysis: F1(1,

both subjects analysis and items analysis (F1(1, 12) = 5.52,
p < 0.05; F2(1, 59) = 6.66, p < 0.05). Longer words (8-

the shorter (5-letters) words. Length by group interaction
did not reach statistical significance in both analyses (F1(1,
