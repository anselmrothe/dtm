hiding behind the last door. The word-pair “Bread:Jam”

randomized for each participant. When pictures of bread and
jam were revealed during the practice trial, participants were
told, “bread and jam go together because jam goes on
bread to make a sandwich.” Participants were then asked to
guess what object was hiding behind the fourth door and

asked to choose the option that “goes with the bread the
