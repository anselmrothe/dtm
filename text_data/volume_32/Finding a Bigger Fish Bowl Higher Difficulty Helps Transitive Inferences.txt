process that might underlie all learning of higher-order

children are not incapable of making a transitive inference
(e.g., Adams, 1978). When preschoolers were taught the
length relation between five sticks in a series (e.g., stick A is
taller than stick B, stick B is taller than stick C, and so on),
they were able to incorporate a new stick into the series and
guess its relative size, integrating the sticks into one
continuous dimension.
   Of course, Adams‟ transitive-inference task on how sticks
relate to each other in their lengths differs from Smith &                        Figure 2. Representation of the three

       Relation 3: 4 trials
   To convey a relation, there were two sets of three movies,
each followed by pre-testing to gauge initial learning.
Movies pertaining to the same relation differed in the way
items were combined with each other. The order in which
movies were presented was randomized across children.
Pre-testing started with a reminder of the relation presented
during the set of movies. For example, if the movies showed
a bigger mouse turning into a darker cloud, the experimenter
explained: “The biggest mouse will always turn into the
darkest cloud.” Four pre-testing trials followed, each asking
what an object turned into. For example, if the movies              Figure 3. Mean performance correct on learning trials (to

interpretation of the results needs to be qualified until we
gain a better understanding of how children match the poles
a priori.
   Taken together, the results suggest that higher-order
transitivity is an emergent property, employed as a means of
reducing learning complexity. With higher complexity of
individual elements, a local focus was compromised,
helping children to note the larger whole. In future studies,
it may be useful to follow up with different conditions, such
as other cover stories or other objects. It remains to be seen
if these claims hold across different domains.
