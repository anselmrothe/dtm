Procedure
Language Task For the language task, we tested 10
German speakers and 12 English speakers. Participants
viewed either the (shortened) List 1 or the (shortened) List
2. They were told that each picture would depict two
household objects paired together, and were asked to
describe each arrangement with a single complete sentence.
Participants recorded their responses on a lined answer sheet
and controlled the pace of the task by advancing the display
themselves.
   Memory Task For the memory task, we tested 16
German speakers and 16 English speakers. None of these
had participated in the language task. Each participant was
assigned to one of the four stimuli orders. The participants           Figure 2: Accuracy in Memory Task of Experiment 1

Procedure

conditions:

task was to repeat the rhythm by tapping it with their fingers

constantly using the syllable “na” (they had to say the
syllable loud enough for the experimenter to hear it).
   Linguistic Completion Procedure was as in Experiment
2 with some modifications. After each picture in the
encoding phase, instead of a blank screen, participants saw a
screen displaying a sentence. The sentence was presented
for 3 seconds and appeared in the native language of each
participant. The sentence described the preceding spatial
scene but was missing the verb and the ground object. For
instance, for Figure 1a above, English speakers saw “The
book ____ on the ____.” Participants were instructed to read
the sentence out loud during the time it was displayed
