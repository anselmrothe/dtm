only appropriate when examining the results of metric MDS
analyses (using true, quantitative distances). In the current
case, where non-metric MDS analyses must be used,
patterns that may normally suggest a two dimensional
internal representation, might actually arise from data that
are truly one dimensional. This problem stems from the
monotone transformations allowed by non-metric MDS,
between the observed similarity data and the internal
psychological distances (as noted originally by Shepard,
1974). Since non-metric MDS analyses only preserve the
rank order of the similarity ratings, leaving the exact
similarity values to vary in systematic ways that best suit the
data, there is considerable flexibility in the spatial
arrangements that might arise from a single underlying
dimension. Therefore both Figure 4a and Figure 4b could be
construed as evidence favouring a single underlying
dimension. Whilst the two proximity plots demonstrate
distinctly different patterns, both provide evidence to
suggest that our stimuli vary on only a single dimension.
   Even though smooth C- or U-shaped proximity plots are
consistent with one dimensional internal representations,
they are also consistent with two dimensional internal
representations – that is, truly C- or U-shaped underlying
structures. We attempt to resolve this ambiguity using a
