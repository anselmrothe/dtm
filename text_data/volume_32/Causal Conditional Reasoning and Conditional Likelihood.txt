Cummins, but confirmed our intuitions about the
unexplained trend in MP; weak alternative items seemed to
have lower causal powers despite being equated across
number of disablers. Surprisingly, Wc did not vary across the
many/few disablers manipulation (t(20)=1.2, ns) suggesting
that number of disablers and causal power were not as
closely linked as we expected. The low correlation between
number of disablers and Wc (r=-0.11, ns) also supported this
conclusion. Pc did not vary across either manipulation.
