for use.
Possible Contributing Factors to Frame of
Reference Selection
Vandeloise (1991) and Levinson (1996, 2003) suggest
that one way to resolve the ambiguity of spatial terms
may lie in the structure of the utterance used to describe
the scene (see also Levelt, 1996). They argue that
rephrasing “the teacup to the left of the teapot” as “the
teacup to the teapot’s left” should encourage use of an OC
frame because the possessive construction points out that
the teapot has its own “left side” that may be separate
from the “left side” that a viewer assigns to the scene.
Moreover, because this construction is specifically
possessive, it may suggest that “the teapot’s left side” is
the correct interpretation.                                                   Figure 1. Example of fronted object stimulus.
