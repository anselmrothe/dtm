(Figure 1). Overall, people judged that Mrs. Smith should
pay more in damages when the independent panel ruled her
to be highly to blame (M = $974.19, SE = $61.97) than
when the panel assigned her a middle level of blame (M =
$615.00, SE = $56.27) than when she was ruled to be of low
blame (M = $425.63, SE = $50.89).
    Interestingly, language also influenced financial liability
judgments. As in Study 1, a subtle change in language led to
a substantial change in financial liability: Mrs. Smith was
held responsible for $153, or 26%, more in damages by
people who got the agentive report (M = $730.75, SE =
$49.57) than by those who got the non-agentive report (M =
