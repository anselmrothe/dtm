between believing and feeling is briefly discussed, as
adopted from (Memon and Treur, 2009). As any mental state
in a person, a belief state induces emotions felt within this
person, as described by Damasio (1999; 2004, p. 93):
    belief → preparation for bodily response → bodily response                    sensor_

    the bodily response → feeling
As a variation, an ‘as if body loop’ uses a direct causal
relation: preparation for the bodily response → sensory
representation of the bodily response; as a shortcut in the causal
chain. The body loop (or as if body loop) is extended to a
recursive body loop (or recursive as if body loop) by                                                                       body_state(b,V)
