The goal of this second study was to use sentences that
were more consistent with real baseball situations, and
to test whether prior knowledge might affect
performance under those circumstances. For this
study, players and positions were paired to reflect
plausible situations, such as:
              The reliever is at the mound.
              The manager is at the mound.
              The catcher is at the mound.
