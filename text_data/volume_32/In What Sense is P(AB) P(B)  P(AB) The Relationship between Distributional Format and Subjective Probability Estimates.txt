The experiment involved three learning tasks, and two
testing conditions, and the measurement of several key
covariates. All participants completed all three learning
tasks, but were tested in only one of the two testing
conditions (based on a random assignment to one of two
groups). The basic procedure was as follows. Participants
were individually tested in a quiet, well-lit room in front
of a computer. Firstly, basic demographic data were
collected. Participants then did a simple practice task to
demonstrate how the interface works and to illustrate
what they would be tested on. Participants then undertook
all three learning-plus-elicitation tasks in a random order,         c)                             d)

not allowed to use external resources (e.g., pen and paper,
calculator) to aid calculations.
