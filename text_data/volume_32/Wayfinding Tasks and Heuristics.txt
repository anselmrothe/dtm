Abstract: Wayfinding is the process of determining and following a route between an origin and a destination
(Golledge, 1999). Research on wayfinding has been conducted by means of a variety of tasks making it difficult to
compare research results among each other. Wiener, Büchner & Hölscher (2009) proposed a taxonomy of wayfinding
tasks that classifies the tasks with respect to external constraints and the type of knowledge that is required to solve
the task. Besides these two factors, heuristics play an important role for wayfinding. A number of heuristics for
wayfinding tasks are documented in the literature, including but not limited to work by the authors. We will first
present the taxonomy and then relate observed heuristics to the tasks. The relationship of tasks and heuristics will
then be discussed with respect to superordinate concepts.
