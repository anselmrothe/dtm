Test Phase After all 12 puzzles in the training phase had
been presented, participants were told that there would now
be a test, with the same instructions as for the practice
puzzles. In the subproblem condition, participants were told
to slide all tiles into place. Participants in all conditions then
attempted to solve the same sequence of 12 full n-puzzles.
The first six were 8-puzzles and the last six were 15-

each puzzle had been solved or had timed out, the next
puzzle was presented without any feedback or time to rest.

participants made a series of 40 pairwise distance
comparisons. In each comparison, they were presented with
two different puzzle states and had to click on the one that
they believed was closer to the goal within a short time
limit. No feedback was given. The short time limit was
designed to elicit a quick, intuitive judgment and prevent
participants from solving the puzzles mentally and then
counting the number of moves used. Because experts in a
domain often have an intuitive sense of how close they are
to solving a problem, and heuristic functions estimate the
distance of any given state to the goal, this distance

the n-puzzle.
   The first 20 pairs to be compared were 8-puzzles, with 10
seconds each, and the last 20 pairs were 15-puzzles, with 12
seconds each. The true distances of the puzzles ranged from
1 to 28, and the ratio of the shorter distance to the longer
distance in each pair was between .2 and .91. For each
comparison, which puzzle was chosen and the time taken to
