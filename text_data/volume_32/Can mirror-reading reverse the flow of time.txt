that was congruent with the space-time mapping encoded in
standard Dutch orthography (e.g., pressing the blue button
for a pastward phrase when the blue button was on the left);
in the other block pressing the correctly colored button
called for an incongruent movement (e.g., pressing the blue
button for a futureward phrase when the blue button was on
the left). The order of congruent-movement and
incongruent-movement blocks was counterbalanced across
participants. The space-time congruity effect was computed
for each subject by comparing response times during
