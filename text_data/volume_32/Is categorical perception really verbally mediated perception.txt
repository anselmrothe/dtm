consistent with the standard CP effect). They also found

   The improvement in perceptual discrimination within a
category (and along the category-irrelevant dimension)
would not be predicted if CP was only the result of verbal
labeling processes since all of these items share the same
label. Instead, it appears to suggest that a non-verbal
learning mechanism is engaged during category learning
that is sensitive to the internal structure of the categories

   Within each interference condition the same pattern of
results hold as across all conditions. Between-category
discriminations increase more relative to baseline than
within-category, which increases more than within-cluster.
The difference in improvement between between-category
and within-category is marginally significant for the no
interference (t(110) = 1.80, p = 0.075) and the spatial
interference conditions (t(110) = 1.79, p = 0.077), and not
significant for the verbal interference condition (t(110) =

and within-cluster improvement is significant in the verbal
interference condition (t(110) = 2.50, p = 0.01), marginally
significant for the no interference condition (t(110) = 1.81, p
= 0.073), and not significant in the spatial interference
condition (t(110) < 1, p = 0.75). The difference in
improvement between between-category and within-cluster
