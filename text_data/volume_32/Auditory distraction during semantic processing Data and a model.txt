Abstract: An experiment is reported demonstrating how free recall of visually-presented, categorically-related lists
of words is disturbed by the presence of auditory distracters which subjects were instructed to ignore. Data show
that auditory distracters from the same category as the to-be-recalled items produce the most disturbance to recall
and result in the most intrusion errors. Additionally, the points at which these intrusion errors occur differ dependent
upon whether recall is written or spoken. A variant of the SIMPLE (Scale Invariant Memory and Perceptual Learning)
model (Brown, Neath & Chater, 2007) is fit to these data and the modifications necessary to achieve this fit are
discussed. It is concluded that intrusion errors are not random but are dependent upon a weighted combination
of the semantic and temporal overlap between the to-be-recalled and to-be-ignored material in semantic processing
tasks and free recall
