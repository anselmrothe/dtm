Sample
In order to investigate these hypotheses, we created an
online laboratory experiment in which 60 German
participants were asked to search for information on a
science weblog. As exemplary scenario, the website dealt
with the controversy on the effects of violent media contents
on children and adolescents. To ensure that this topic was
personally relevant, participants were parents with children
between the age of 2 and 18. Subjects were recruited via
different channels, e.g. newspaper ads, postings in forums
for parents and flyers which were distributed in schools.
Participants (30 female, 30 male) were between the age of
22 and 47 (M = 36.93; SD = 6.54). 26.7 % of them had a
university degree, 31.7 % finished high school with a
qualification for university entrance and 41.7 % finished                       Figure 1: Screenshot of the weblog
