The problem-solving goal is to construct a symbolic model
of the situation that can be used to solve the problem, e.g.:
                (.11 x $715) + (.15 x V) = $165
The problem-solving curriculum consists of four problem
types: Two types of “arithmetic problems,” in which the
unknown value is naturally represented as an isolated
variable on one side of the equation, and two types of
“algebra problems” in which the unknown quantity is more
naturally represented as a variable that is embedded in one
or in two expressions in the equation. See Figure 1 for an
example of each type.
