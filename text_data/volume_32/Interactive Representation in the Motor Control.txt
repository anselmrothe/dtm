Interactive Representation in the Motor Control
Daniel Hsi-wen Liu
Providence University
Abstract: Within the approach to embodied representation, Bickhard’s (1993, 2000) account of interactive representation, like Rosenberg & Anderson’s (2004) guidance theory of representation, employs a notion of representation
that is not grounded on the standing-in-for relation. However, Bickhard’s accounts of interactive representation
remains in need of explanation as to why the interactive representation is genuine representation. The present paper
aims at this explanation, with the focus of anticipatory motor activities, by employing Merleau-Ponty’s notion of
’motor intentionality’ (Merleau-Ponty, 2006). For this, the present paper explains how the interactive representation
relates to motor performance in its immediate environment, in other words, how the interactive representation gains
its intentional content. In addition, the present paper argues that the interactive representation of motor activities
provides the guidance of motor actions, and vice versa, hence Bickhard’s notion of interactive representation and
Rosenberg & Anderson’s guidance theory of representation are two versions of the same theory.
