    In summary, young children’s difficulties with haptic-to-

stem from their failure to execute mature hand movements

we asked whether additional tests of children’s haptic
exploratory abilities would point to the same conclusion.

formation of representations focused of shape. A new
finding in the present study is evidence that representations
built from visual input can transfer, complete with their
focus on shape, into the haptic mode. Specifically, the
present findings of a predominance of same-shape object
matches in the haptic modality given only visual experience
of the exemplar object suggests that representations of that
visual experience guided the haptic identification of a
matching objet. Thus, it appears that the shape bias in visual
object matching remained intact during the transfer of
perceptual information about exemplar objects from the
visual into the haptic realm.
