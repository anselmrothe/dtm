                        Experiment
Method
Infants were exposed to a cross-situational word learning
task (Smith & Yu, 2008; Yu & Smith, in press). Each child
viewed a series of trials pairing two novel objects with one
novel label. While the correspondence between words and
objects on an individual trial was ambiguous, cross-trial co-
occurrence statistics between words and objects indicated
the correct pairings. After 60 training trials, preferential
looking tests were used to determine whether infants had
learned the correct pairings.
Participants. Twenty-five 15-month-old infants (14
females, M = 14 mos, 23 days, range: 13;22 to 16;4)

goal was to derive a generative model for each infant that
produced fixation patterns that best approximated his or her
own generated fixations.
   Because of the structure of the training and testing trials,
we divided the time course of fixations into a series of 1
second bins (Figure 1). Proportion of looking to each of the
two on-screen objects was calculated in each such window,
and model was fit to this data.
   Conceptually, the model is simple. Let us suppose that
fixation patterns within a given window are generated by the
combination of two processes: habituation to each of the
objects on the screen, and association between each of the
objects and the label being heard. Let us also suppose that

This indicates that habituation and association account for a
significant proportion of each infant’s looking behavior,
both in training and testing. Further, functions which are
appropriate for describing training can also describe test
behavior. An example of the model’s fit to one infant is
shown in Figure 4 above.
   Now that we have found the best model which accounts
for each infant’s looking behavior, we can determine which
infants are likely to have learned word-referent mappings.
Preferential looking behavior, while a good measure of
learning at a group level, can be quite difficult to interpret at
the individual level (Aslin, 2007; Houston-Price, Nakai,
2004; Hunter & Ames, 1988). There are several reasons for
this. First, as mentioned above, the function which links
