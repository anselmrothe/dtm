however, is readily captured through the repeated applica-
tion of Eq. 2. Conceptually, the model of Figure 2 reflects,
on the part of the participant, an inference to the chip that
the experimenter would have drawn had he/she been draw-
ing randomly from the bookbag. Once participants are as-
sumed to treat the experimenter as a partially reliable source
in this way, conservatism is unavoidable.
   Unavoidable conservatism becomes apparent in the simu-

pokerchip experiment. For these simulations, the prior prob-

P(Hred), was .5. In order to manipulate the diagnostic value
of a single chip, the proportion of the predominant chips in
