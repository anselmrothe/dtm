Apparatus and stimuli
The participants were seated in front of a computer screen at
a distance of 600-700 mm. (The distance varied slightly
because of the subjects’ freedom to move their head and
body.) The eye tracker used was the SMI iView RED250,
which has a sampling frequency of 250 Hz and a precision
of 0.02°. The data was recorded with the iView X 2.4
