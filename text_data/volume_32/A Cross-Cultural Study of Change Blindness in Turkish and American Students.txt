  The current study aimed to get some insight into Turkish
people’s perceptions. We ran a change blindness experiment
on Turks and Americans. We were expecting to find that
Turkish people have holistic perceptions like East Asians;
however, our results suggest that they have analytical
perceptions like Westerners. We believe that there needs to
be more research done in this area to understand how
exactly Turkish people perceive the world.
