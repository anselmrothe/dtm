   From a game-theoretic standpoint, the game in this exper-
iment shares several features with so-called stag hunt games,
which have been extensively studied in the lab. In the alle-
gorical stag hunt, two neighbors decide whether to hunt hare
separately, or to work together to hunt (the more rewarding)
stag. Even though both individuals benefit by coordinating
for the larger quarry, they may decide that the costs of coor-
dination, and their uncertainty as to the actions of their neigh-
bor, are too great. In its synchronous form, game theory does
not predict which outcome is more likely without refinements
like risk and payoff dominance (Harsanyi & Selten, 1988).
However, in the asynchronous, extended form, in which one
neighbor is forced to make a choice that the other can ob-
serve beforehand, theory predicts that the rational player will
select the high payoff equilibrium (Kuhn, 2009). Similarly,
continuous-time games in the laboratory have led to more ef-
fective coordinative behavior than comparable synchronous
games (D. Friedman & Oprea, 2009).                                    Figure 1: Screenshot of game board. Icons are controlled by partic-
