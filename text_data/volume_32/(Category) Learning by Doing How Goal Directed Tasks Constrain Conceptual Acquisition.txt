wire and varied in terms of how they fit onto the terminal
posts: The connector either fit over an open post or was
inserted into a hole drilled into the “capped and drilled”
post. As can be seen in Figure 1, each set of terminal posts
in the Type A boards featured one post that has been capped
and drilled and two posts that were open. In contrast, the
Type B boards featured sets consisting of two capped and
drilled posts and one open post. The configuration of the
posts is considered to be the goal-relevant feature for the
flexible condition because they constrain how the flexible
connectors can be placed onto the board.
   In the solid condition, the connectors were made of
inflexible aluminum pieces, and the placement of these
connectors was constrained by the presence of components
situated near the terminal posts. For the Type A boards, the
connectors had to go between components. For the Type B
boards, the connectors had to go around the components.
Thus, the relationship of the components to the posts is
considered the goal-relevant feature for the solid condition
because it constrained how the solid connectors could be
placed onto the board.
   The electrical components were unique to each board.
However, each of the boards featured a perceptually salient
correlated component. The correlated component for the
Type A boards was a two-inch section of a computer
memory module placed in the near left corner, and the
correlated component for the Type B boards was a stack of
silver clips with copper wire loops placed in the far right
