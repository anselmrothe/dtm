described an event at the destination was added, encouraging
movement all the way to the destination. Similarly, two

character closer to the path in the past progressive condition,
and close to the destination in the simple past condition,
replicates previous evidence that the ongoing nature implied
by a past progressive verb draws attention to the middle
portion of the path, whereas there is a tendency to focus
attention on the destination in response to simple past verbs.
