with which children are quite familiar (Wellman, 1990).
Critically, this constraint fully limits one’s free will, much
like a physical constraint. Thus, we predict that, if children
understand intangible (non-physical) constraints, the results
should replicate Kushnir et al.’s (2009) findings.
   Experiment 3 explored the second question by asking
preschoolers about their freedom to act against constraints
which, by adult intuitions may influence behavior, but do
not fully constrain one’s free will. Therefore, we asked
children whether they believed they had the choice to do
otherwise when bound by moral considerations, personal
preference, permission, and conformity.

   Figure 3 shows the same pattern in children’s
explanations. The majority of explanations (54.5%; 12/22)
in the Constrained Drawing trial appeal to the epistemic
constraint imposed in the task. Epistemic explanations were
provided more often than non-explanations, χ2 (1, N = 15) =
5.40, p < .05, enactments, χ2 (1, N = 16) = 4.00, p < .05, and
other constraints, χ2 (1, N = 15) = 5.40, p < .05. In contrast,
in the Free Drawing trial children mostly provided
enactments and non-explanations. In the Free Drawing trial,
enactments were provided most often, significantly more
often than references to epistemic constraints, χ2 (1, N = 11)
= 4.46, p < .05 and the proportion of enactments was not
significantly different from the proportion of non-

Results and Discussion
   The results show that, to a large extent, 4- and 5-year-old
children believe their free will is constrained by all four
contexts. Overall, 77% (46/60) responses to the Alternate
Choice Judgment question were “no’s” and 67% (40/60) of
the explanations refer to one of the coded constraints.
However, there were also important differences between the
four constraints in both judgments and explanations.
   Figure 6 shows that a significant majority of children
(87%; 13/15) indicated that they did not have the choice to
act immorally (Binomial p < .05) or against conformity
(87%; Binomial p < .05). A non-significant majority
indicated that they could not act against permission (60%;
9/15), or their own preference (73%; 11/15).
