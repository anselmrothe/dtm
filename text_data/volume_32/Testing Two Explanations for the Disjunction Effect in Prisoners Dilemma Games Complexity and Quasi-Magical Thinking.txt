Procedure
After the eye-tracking calibration, subjects received
instructions and were tested for understanding the
instructions. Then each subject played 5 training games, and
next the 80 games described above.
   The game was presented in a formal and a neutral
formulation. On the interface, the cooperation move was
labeled ‘1’ and the defection move was labeled ‘2’.
However, further in the paper, for convenience, we will
continue to use cooperation instead of move ‘1’ and
defection instead of move ‘2’.
                                                                           Figure 3: Mean cooperation (%) in Experiment 1 for

statistically significant when the payoffs were simple. It
seems that these results support the complexity explanation
for the disjunction effect because change in the complexity
of the payoffs changes the participants’ choices and the
disjunction effect diminishes.
Eye-movements results
We defined several areas on the screen that are interesting in
studying information acquisition during PD game playing.
Each Area of Interest (AOI) contains the box in which the
information is presented and a small region around it. Here
