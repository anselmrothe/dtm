This assumption can be relaxed but the general conclusions
reported here hold for all reasonably high levels of accuracy
(to just above chance). The size of the pool from which the
test items are drawn is set at 100 but the same pattern of
results is obtained for all large values of N. The key
prediction is the relation between the proportion of correct
decisions (calculated by equation (1)) and n, the number of
items in the pool the participant can recognize. A less-is-
more effect occurs, according to Goldstein & Gigerenzer’s
(2002) definition whenever performance of the inference
task is demonstrably superior under conditions where fewer
items from the pool of test items are recognized. McCloy et
