   We developed a set of Perl scripts to extract the specific
information of interest for this study from the XML files
(exported as .its files by the LENA software). Specifically,
we extracted the start and end times of each segment labeled
with relatively high confidence as coming from the child
wearing the recorder (child near, CHN, segments, labeled as
such because they fell near the maximum of the Gaussian
mixture model that gave the likelihood that a segment was
produced by the child) and of each segment labeled as
coming from an adult with relatively high confidence
(female adult near, FAN, or male adult near, MAN). Note
that loudness and nearness to the child increase the
confidence of segment coding and therefore increase the
likelihood of a sound being included in the present study.
Also, there were minimum duration thresholds for each
segment label type; thus, a long string of vocalization by the
same speaker could only be split if there was an intervening
silence, TV, or other-speaker vocalization meeting the
minimum duration requirement. We also identified child
segments that contained only speech-like sub-segments as
well as those that contained only cry/vegetative sub-
segments. All the subsequent response time and cross
recurrence calculations were made using only those child
segments that contained no cry/vegetative sub-segments and
at least one speech-like sub-segment.
Response Time Analysis
We developed a set of programs written in Perl and R that
automatically extracted and calculated response time
information from the speaker labels. First, adult response
times were calculated according to the following procedure.
For each child segment, we determined whether an adult
segment followed without any child segment intervening.
Other sound source labels were permitted to intervene
between the child segment and the subsequent adult
segment. Then the time between the offset of the child
segment and the onset of the adult segment was calculated.             Figure 1: On the top is the cross recurrence plot for the
