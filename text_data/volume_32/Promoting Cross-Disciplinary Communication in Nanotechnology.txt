Abstract: Nanotechnology is a quickly growing field comprised of researchers from many disciplines who investigate
nanoscale materials and phenomena. Because many well-established disciplines merge together to form the field of
nanotechnology, a crucial aspect of nanotechnology education is promoting cross-disciplinary thinking and collabo-
ration. We present a model that proposes a novel approach to multidisciplinary learning in nanotechnology. While
existing educational solutions attempt to expose students to content from all of the nanotechnology disciplines, we
focus on the development of visual communication skills as a means to promoting cross-disciplinary thinking and
communication. We have developed a graduate course that combines the instruction of visual communication design
principles with a studio component that allows students to create science graphics and reflect on how design choices
relate to disciplinary goals and cross-disciplinary communication. We discuss the benefit of this course in the larger
nanotechnology educational curriculum.
