Do graphics and text influence navigation for some

task of locating a widget? Generally, we assume that users
would visit a website with a predefined goal in mind. Thus,
what would be the impact on their accuracy of finding the
correct target page? This formed the starting point of our
next study in which we wanted to investigate if providing
meaningful icons next to hyperlinks would aid the user in
navigating better. Would it help the user in finding their
answers to their goals quicker? Van Oostendorp and Holzel
(2005) for instance did find that presenting icons of the
participants next to labels of messages on a bulletin board
