Abstract: Hagmayer & Sloman (2009) proposed causal model theory of choice based on causal Bayesian networks
in order to provide comprehensive explanation for causal reasoning and decision making. The purpose of this
study is to test predictions made by their theory. It considers that a deliberately chosen action is an intervention
and that inferences based on choice are derived from structure of causal models in disregard of parameters of
them (i.e., base rate, causal strength). In Experiment 1, we manipulated base rate and asked participants to infer
probabilities conditional on deliberately chosen actions, interventions, and observations within common cause model.
The estimates based on choices resembled that based on interventions and didnâ€™t reflect the differences in base rate.
In Experiment 2, in which causal strength was manipulated within participants, the results revealed that participants
neglected common cause. The differences in experimental situations between causal reasoning and decision making
are discussed.
