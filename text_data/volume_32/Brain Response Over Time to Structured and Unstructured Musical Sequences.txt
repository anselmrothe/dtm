Abstract: Research in speech and music shows that listeners model their auditory environment to form expectations
about future input. Here we asked how the ability to predict upcoming musical tones based on both general
implicit knowledge of musical structure and familiarity with a particular tune influence early portions of the auditory
evoked response (AER). Using electroencephalography, we examined how predictability influenced brain responses
to repeated tunes. The musical stimuli were simple, monophonic Irish folk tunes (Normal) and Random sequences
in which the notes of each tune were presented in randomized order. Because the Random stimuli lacked musical
structure, we hypothesized that listeners would be unsuccessful in learning or creating predictive models for these
sequences. Differences were observed in early AER between the Normal and Random sequences. The results suggest
that listeners successfully learn, remember and model the Normal sequences, but are unable to do this for Random
sequences.
