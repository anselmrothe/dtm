Abstract: Quantitative modeling has contributed substantially to the advancement of the cognitive sciences. Papers
introducing and testing cognitive models regularly appear in the top journals. The growth and success of cognitive
modeling demonstrate why modeling itself should be a primary quantitative method in the researcherâ€™s toolbox. Yet
this method of scientific investigation remains under-utilized by the research community at large, in part because of
the hassles in obtaining data sets to model and the difficulties in implementing models. The goal of this project is to
assist scientists in their cognitive modeling efforts by creating an online repository containing data sets that can be
modeled and the cognitive models themselves. The current state of the project and future plans will be presented.
