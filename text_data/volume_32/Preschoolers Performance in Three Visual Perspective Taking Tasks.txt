Abstract: Previous studies suggested that visual perspective taking (VPT) requires spatial computation (transformation) and solving conflict between reality and imagination (interference). The current study examined how these
two processes may influence preschoolers’ performance in different VPT tasks. Eighty-four 3 5-year-old children and
8 adult controls completed three VPT tasks, where different conditions were set to manipulate the requirement to
perform transformation and to solve interference. The result showed that 4-year-olds could solve the interference between reality and imagination, but the immature spatial computation ability remained a confining factor throughout
preschool years and prevented children from passing more complex VPT tasks.
