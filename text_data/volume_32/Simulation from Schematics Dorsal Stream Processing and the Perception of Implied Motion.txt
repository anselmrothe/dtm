   The findings of Lobmaier et al. (2008) suggest that the
perception of implied motion in static scenes will be more
pronounced when stimuli are highly schematic, as opposed
to highly realistic. Highly schematic stimuli are more likely
to be processed in the dorsal stream than in the ventral
stream; processing in the dorsal stream should produce
larger effects of implied motion, and hence a stronger
displacement effect. If this initial prediction is supported,
we might find that displacement can be modulated in other
ways as well. In particular, it might be possible to influence
how a stimulus is processed by varying the observer‟s
mental set. Because relational words like verbs and
prepositions encode the world in a relatively schematic                      Figure 1: The Realistic (top) and Schematic
