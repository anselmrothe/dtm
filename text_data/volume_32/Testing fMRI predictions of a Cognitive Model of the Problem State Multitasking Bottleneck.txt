Abstract: It has been shown that people can only maintain one intermediate mental representation, or ’problem
state’, concurrently. When multiple problem states have to be maintained, performance decreases sharply, an effect
referred to as the problem state bottleneck. We investigate this bottleneck using a triple-task, in which participants
have to solve subtraction problems, enter text, and perform a listening task concurrently. The triple-task confirmed
the existence of a problem state bottleneck. To explain the behavioral results in detail, a cognitive model was
developed using ACT-R (Anderson, 2007) and the threaded cognition theory (Salvucci & Taatgen, 2008). The
model showed a close fit to the emperical data. It was subsequently used to generate fMRI predictions for five brain
areas. These predictions where tested in an experiment, showing a good correspondence between model predictions
and fMRI data, indicating that the problem state bottleneck is probably located in the intraparietal sulcus.
