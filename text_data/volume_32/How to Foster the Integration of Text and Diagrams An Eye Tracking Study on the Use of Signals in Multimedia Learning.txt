Abstract: Learners studying text and diagrams (multimedia) often fail to integrate information from both sources.
Hence, signals that make explicit the relation between both representations should improve understanding. The
current study investigated which changes in information processing can explain improvements in comprehension
due to signals. In an eye tracking study 35 students learned about the functioning of the heart. In a no-signals
condition, a text and diagram were presented unaltered. In the signals-condition, correspondences between the
representations were highlighted by means of labels, color coding, and deixis. Signals improved understanding of
text-diagram correspondences and guided attention towards diagrams. Moreover, diagrams were fixated earlier in
the signals-condition. A mediation analysis showed that these changes in visual attention completely explained the
effect of signals on comprehension. Hence, signals improve learning from text and diagrams by fostering learnersâ€™
early reference to diagrams and by increasing the amount of attention devoted to them.
