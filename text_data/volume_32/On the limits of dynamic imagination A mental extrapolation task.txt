   The white ball (the launcher) either did or did not contact
the green ball (the target), but the target always started its
movement as fast as the launcher and in the same direction.
   A red rectangular screen was positioned such that its
border contacted the edge of the target and its length
covered the entire trajectory of the target. After initiating its
movement, the target continued its trajectory behind the
screen, until the end of the animation segment. Three
vertical black lines were drawn on the red screen, placed at
six different positions, yielding two configurations (see
Tables 1 and 2). The direction of the balls (movement to the
right, or left) was balanced across trials.
   Three different spatio-temporal conditions were
implemented by either varying the spatial interval between
the launcher and the target at the end of the launcher's
movement, or by varying the delay between the end of the
launchers' movement and the beginning of the target's
movement.                                                                Figure 1. Overall sequence of events in a trial and causal

30 years (mean age = 22,9).
