to learn 18 pseudoword-object pairings from 27 12-second
trials. This design allowed each stimulus (and hence each
correct word-referent pairing) to be presented six times. In
one form or another, the learning of a pairing involves the
accumulation of word-object co-occurrence statistics across
the training trials. Participants acquired, on average, nine of
the 18 pairs, as measured by a 4-alternative forced choice
(4AFC) referent test for each word.
   When each trial contains 16 possible word-referent
associations, how might learning proceed? There are at least
two distinct approaches that learners may apply. First, an
ideal associative learner may maintain a word x object co-
occurrence matrix M, incrementing the count in cell Mw,o
whenever word w and object o appear together in a trial.
Table 1 shows such a matrix, which represents the training
statistics used in the present study. At test, such a learner      Table 1: Word x Referent matrix with the co-occurrences of

Procedure
Condition order was fixed, and each participant took part in
all four blocks. Block 0 was a three trial training period with
three words and objects per trial, followed by a recognition
test of every individual stimulus presented, and nine new
words and objects. In block 1, participants were instructed
to study individual stimuli for a memory test. However,
following the 27 training trials, participants were instead
asked to indicate how many times [0-6] each of 54 specific         Figure 1: Mean correlation of participants’ responses with
