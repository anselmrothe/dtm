experiment in which participants, which consisted of adults
and children the age of five, either participated in a                Head
categorization task in which they had to induce a novel
category property to animal photos, or they participated in a
baseline condition in which they merely studied the photos.
A surprise recognition task followed either of the two
conditions, and it was found that adults experienced a sharp
decrement in their ability to discriminate between studied
and non-studied category items due to an increase in false
alarms to related distracters. Children, in contrast,
experienced no such decrement in their memory
performance between the two conditions. The authors
attribute this dissociation in performance between the two
age groups to the fact that adults are much more sensitive to
category-based information, while children are much more              Body
sensitive to item-based information.
   These findings are consistent with a large number of
findings from the research review performed by Brainerd,
Reyna, and Ceci (2008). In this review, a number of
experiments were discussed in which it was demonstrated
that children are much less susceptible to false memory
errors, a pattern which increases with age up until
adulthood. These effects and age trends were evident in
paradigms ranging from DRM type tasks to suggestibility
experiments. The authors attribute these errors, particularly

facilitation manifested itself in a bias for category relevant
features in their eye movements. For children, no such
facilitation could be found in either their behavioral data or
in their eye movements, implying that they may be meeting
the predictions of the item-noise models of recognition
memory.
   We believe this is important research because despite
there being a large volume of research on developmental
differences in episodic memory, there has been little work
connecting these differences to the components and
processes of current memory models. We hope that this
work as well as future work will make clear connections
between the developmental literature and the modeling
