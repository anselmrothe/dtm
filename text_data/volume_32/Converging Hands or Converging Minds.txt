they call alignment. They state that at each linguistic level,
“the activation of a representation in one interlocutor leads
to the activation of the matching representation in the other
interlocutor directly”, p. 177. These representations are
thought to be used in both language production and process-
sing (parity of representation). Thus, if a certain lexical or
semantic representation has just been constructed as a result
of hearing an utterance, it can subsequently be used for
production. In addition to this direct source of alignment
across interlocutors, alignment at one level can also enhance
alignment at certain other levels within a speaker, because
of bidirectional connections between the representations at
different levels. Thus, if a lexical representation is
connected to a semantic one, activation of that semantic              Figure 1: Part of a scene used in the experiment, note the
