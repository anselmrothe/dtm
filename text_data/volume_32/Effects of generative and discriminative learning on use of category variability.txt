Several experiments have shown an effect of category vari-
ability on human categorization judgments. In these experi-
ments, the stimuli belong to one of two categories with dif-
ferent means and variances. The key question is how stimuli
with features lying (perceptually) in between the two cate-
gories are categorized. The results of these experiments all
showed that there was a bias towards categorizing stimuli into
the high-variance category (Stewart & Chater, 2002; Cohen
et al., 2001; Rips, 1989; Smith & Sloman, 1994). Here we
propose that the degree of preference for the high variance
category may be affected by whether the learner is adopting
a generative or discriminative approach.
   Intuitively, we expect category variability to have a greater
effect on generative learners because estimating p(x|c) for
each category requires being sensitive to the variance of that
category. In contrast, one need not consider the variance of
the stimuli in simply learning a function from x to c, p(c|x).
Indeed many discriminative models used in machine learn-
ing, such as support vector machines (Schölkopf & Smola,
2002), focus just on the location of the most extreme mem-
bers of each category. We are not claiming that all generative
models are sensitive to category variance, or that all discrimi-            Cat A Middle stimuli                      Cat B

life consists of a mix of scenarios in which one or the other of
these strategies is more appropriate, clarifying when people
use generative and discriminative approaches will help us un-
derstand differences in learning among individuals and across
situations. We anticipate that exploring these questions will
result in improved models of human category learning, and
a tighter coupling between research on human and machine
learning.
