their interpretation of words that have contextually specified
alternatives (for discussion, see Hirschberg, 1985). Previous
studies find that young children are able to strengthen
utterances that rely on contextual alternatives. For example,
Goro, Minai & Crain (2006) found that children rejected
sentences like “Only Bunny Rabbit will eat a carrot or a
pepper” in contexts where another character ate a pepper.
   We tested the hypothesis that children’s difficulty is due
to difficulty generating relevant alternatives by (1)
