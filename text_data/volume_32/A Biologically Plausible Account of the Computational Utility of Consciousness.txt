Abstract: According to Mathis and Mozer (1996), visual awareness requires internal representations to be stable
over time. They demonstrated that attractor dynamics in a hand-wired, abstract, connectionist model could both
produce this stability and also explain behavioral differences between conditions of subliminal and supraliminal
stimulus presentation. One such demonstration involved a lexical decision study by Marcel (1980), in which conscious
perception of an ambiguous prime word, disambiguated by previous context, sped lexical decision of a subsequent
target word only when the target was related to the context-cued meaning of the prime. In contrast, subliminal
presentation of the prime produced facilitation for targets related to either meaning of the prime. Here, we show
that the attractor dynamics needed to explain this effect naturally arise from the balance of excitatory and inhibitory
connections in cortex, as modeled in the biologically constrained Leabra framework, providing some neuroscientific
support for this account of visual awareness.
