Abstract: The aim of the present studies are to assess the sensory nature hypothesis of knowledge through a series
of experimental results. Especially, we investigated the links between memory and perception using a short-term
priming paradigm based on a previous learning phase consisting of the association between a geometrical shape and
a white noise. The priming phase examined the effect of a geometrical shape, seen in the learning phase, on the
processing of a target (tones or picture). Our main results demonstrate that memory and perception share some
mechanisms and components. These ones are relevant for the processing of each form of knowledge (episodic and
semantic). At last, reflections about the implication of this work to study perceptual learning and memory are
presented.
