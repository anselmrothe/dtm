                              Abstract
    Human beings show a robust nonindependence effect in causal
    reasoning: they predict that collateral effects should be corre-
    lated even given a common cause. This presents a problem for
    existing models of causal reasoning, as most predict indepen-
    dence. To deal with this problem, we propose an edge replace-
    ment process that builds up apparently probabilistic causal re-
    lations using hidden deterministic causes. This model allows
    us to fit nonindependence effects, and shows promise for mod-
    eling other phenomena, such as how causal relations change
    over time.
    Keywords: Markov violations; nonindependence; causal rea-
    soning; models of causal reasoning

    Causal graphical models (hereafter, “CGMs”), (Pearl,

according to minimality, independence should be our initial
expectation.
   Human beings do not have this expectation. In several ex-
periments (Mayrhofer, Hagmayer, & Waldmann, 2008; Re-
hder & Burnett, 2005; Walsh & Sloman, 2004) participants

even in novel scenarios, and even when independence is ex-
plicitly emphasized. Such nonindependence effects show that
if people respect CGMs, they do not respect minimality. This
raises the question of what principle, if any, people do respect.
   Rehder and Burnett (2005) proposed an “underlying mech-
anism model” to address this problem, in which people repre-
sent hidden intermediate causal structure. In its current form,
this model allows only qualitative fits to the data. Our model
is one way of formalizing and extending Rehder and Burnett’s
proposal in order to make quantitative predictions. Further,
Mayrhofer et al. (2008) modeled nonindependence effects
using a source of common preventative noise, whose strength
they fit to the data. Again, we hope to build on this initial
step, and account formally for the source of this noise in a
more principled way, while using fewer parameters to fit ex-
perimental data.                                                      Figure 2: A series of edge replacements leading to a graph.

            Fitting nonindependence effects
Walsh and Sloman (2004)
Walsh and Sloman (2004) showed a nonindependence effect
that provides the simplest test of our model. They told adult
participants simple common effect cover stories, in which
event C caused both events E1 and E2 . For instance, some
participants were told that jogging (C) caused both increased
fitness (E1 ) and weight loss (E2 ). They then asked partici-
pants to judge P(E1 |C) and P(E1 |C, ¬E2 ). Figure 3 shows

Rehder and Burnett (2005)
Another dataset is provided by Rehder and Burnett (2005),
who found a nonindependence effect in the domain of feature
inference. They told adult participants that one novel feature
of a category (C), caused three other novel features (E1,2,3 ).
They then asked participants to judge the probability of one
feature in a member of the category, given some value of C,
and some number of other collateral effects. In Experiment 1,
participants were given a cover story involving natural kinds.
In Experiment 2, participants were not given a cover story at
all – they were told that abstract features caused each other.      Figure 4: Data from Rehder and Burnett (2005) along with
