Abstract
Recent research demonstrated that although twenty-four
month-old infants do well on the initial pairing of a novel
word and novel object in fast-mapping tasks, they are unable
to retain the mapping after a five-minute break. The current
study examines the role of familiarity with the objects and
words on children’s retention in fast-mapping tasks. Twentyfour month-old infants were familiarized with either a series
of novel objects or a series of novel names prior to the
referent selection portion of a fast-mapping task. Infants
retained the novel mapping after a delay when familiarized
with the novel objects, but did not demonstrate retention
when familiarized with the novel words. The results suggest
familiarity with the object or word-form lead to differential
encoding of the name-object link and altered subsequent word
learning.

Introduction
Fast-mapping, or the ability to quickly link a novel word to
a novel referent is perhaps the canonical example of young
children’s word learning prowess. In Carey’s (1978)
original demonstration of this phenomenon, preschoolers
correctly determined that the novel word “chromium”
referred to a novel olive-green colored tray rather than a
familiar blue-colored tray. This result has been replicated
and extended many times (see, for instance, Golinkoff,
Hirsch-Pasek, Bailey, & Wenger, 1992; Mervis & Bertrand,
1994; Wilkinson, Ross, & Diamond, 2003). Fast-mapping
has been demonstrated in infants as young as 17 months
(Halberda, 2003), and 30-month-olds have been shown to
fast-map as many as six novel items in a single session
(Golinkoff et al, 1992). On the basis of such results, there
has been a general tendency in the literature to equate fastmapping and word learning and to see fast-mapping as the
basis for children’s rapid word learning (see Horst &
Samuelson, 2008 for discussion). However, retention has
only rarely been examined in fast-mapping paradigms, and
recent work suggests that children do not retain the links
between a novel name and object formed in these tasks.
Horst and Samuelson (2008) examined retention of nameobject links presented in a fast-mapping context with 24month-old infants. Their fast-mapping paradigm included
both referent selection and retention trials. On referent
selection trials, infants were presented with two known
objects (“get the block”); on other trials, infants were asked

for the novel object (“get the roke”). On retention trials,
which followed five minutes after referent selection, infants
were presented with two objects that had been fast-mapped
in the referent selection trials, and a third, previously seen
but not named object. During these trials, infants were asked
to get one of the previously fast-mapped objects by name.
Because all three objects presented on retention trials were
equally novel, Horst and Samuelson’s task is very stringent.
In this carefully controlled environment, infants performed
well in the referent selection trials – choosing the known
object 73% of the time when requested, and the novel object
69% of the time it was requested. However, retention of the
fast-mapped name-object link was no higher than chance
after the 5-minute delay (Horst & Samuelson, 2008;
Experiment 1A).
The fact that the children in Horst and Samuelson’s
(2008) study did not retain the newly fast-mapped words
contradicts some prior findings of retention following fast
mapping. For example, Carey & Bartlett (1978) examined
children’s memory for “chromium” a week after the original
presentation and found that the majority of children retained
the link between the word “chromium” and some form of
the color green. Likewise, Markson and Bloom (1997)
demonstrated retention of novel fast-mapped words in 3-4
year-old children. However, as Horst and Samuelson (2008)
point out, many of these prior studies did not use as
stringent a measure of retention. For example, Carey and
Bartlett (1978) presented the novel name and referent during
a very familiar sequence of events (setting up for snack
time), thus allowing for many possible contextual supports
for retention. Other work demonstrating retention has
isolated the target so that it is the only object named during
test (Markson & Bloom, 1997) or used ostensive naming in
conjunction with fast-mapping (Mervis & Bertrand, 1994),
thus failing to provide a stringent test of retention.
Furthermore, Horst and Samuelson’s data does fit with
Carey’s (1978) original proposal of a slow-mapping process
that follows the initial fast-mapping of a word to an object.
In particular, Carey proposed that after children initially
map the novel object and name (fast-mapping), further
experience and exposure is required to fully learn the new
word and referent (slow-mapping). Subsequent studies have
examined this slow-mapping process, demonstrating that
depth of semantic representation (Capone & McGregor,
2005), lexical practice (Gershkoff-Stowe, 2002; GershkoffStowe & Hahn, 2007), and word segmentation (Graf Estes,

2621

Evans, Alibali, & Saffran, 2007) all play a role in successful
word retention and retrieval. The current study follows this
line of work, examining the role of prior familiarity with the
components of the mapping on retention of newly fastmapped words.
It seems like familiarity with the components to be
mapped may aid children’s formation of a lasting
association between a novel word and object by aiding in
the creation a fairly robust, stable representation of each
component. Horst, Samuelson, and McMurray (under
review), have recently demonstrated that visual familiarity
influences the process of referent selection. Likewise,
Capone and McGregor (2005) demonstrated that ostensively
highlighting the visual properties of objects (i.e. cueing
shape) boosts infants’ fast-mapping of object labels and
their referents, whereas Graf Estes et al. (2007)
demonstrated that statistical segmentation of auditory word
forms can play a role in subsequent referent selection.
In the present experiments we used a stringent version of
the standard forced-choice referent selection and retention
task, modeled after Horst and Samuelson (2008), but added
a minimal familiarization period prior to the referent
selection task. We used the 3-trial version of Horst and
Samuelson’s task (2008, Experiment 1C) to reduce the
chance of fatigue that might be caused by the time added by
the familiarization period. Using this procedure, Horst and
Samuelson (2008) found that only 60% of infants in their 3trial experiment succeeded in the initial mapping of the
name and object during referent selection. While this was a
statistically significant level of mapping, it means that
retention could only be tested in 12 infants. We found
similar levels of mapping in pilot testing. Thus, in an effort
to boost the number of infants who initially map the novel
word to the novel object, we used the same three known
items throughout the warm-up and referent selection trials
(rather than using different known objects on each of the
referent selection trials).
In Experiment 1 we examined the role of minimal
familiarity with the objects or word-forms in infants’
retention of fast-mapped words. Half the infants were given
the novel objects to explore freely for two minutes prior to
the referent selection task. The other half of the infants
heard the novel word multiple times prior to the referent
selection trials. As in Horst and Samuelson (2008), there
was a five minute delay between the referent selection and
retention trials. Only infants familiarized with the objects
demonstrated significant retention. Experiments 2
and 3 serve as controls to ensure our findings were not due
to our use of the same known objects on all referent

selection trials (Experiment 2), or the use of a highly salient
favorite novel item as the target (Experiment 3). Taken
together, then, these experiments probe the degree to which
prior encoding of either the word or object boosts the
retention of fast-mapped words.

Experiment 1: Object and Word
Familiarization
Methods
Participants Forty 24-month-old-infants (20 girls, M = 24
months, 26 days; range = 24 months, 10 days – 25 months,
13 days) with a mean vocabulary of 303 words (range = 21672) participated. All infants were recruited through county
birth records and were native English speakers. Participant’s
parents provided informed consent prior to the start of the
study. Participants received a small toy for participation.
Stimuli Each infant saw a random selection of three out of
sixteen possible known items and three or six of eight
possible novel items over the course of the experiment (see
Figure 1). Parents confirmed the status of each object as
known or novel prior to the experiment. Substitute items
were used if the infant was unfamiliar with any of the
known items or familiar with any of the novel items. During
the session, stimuli were presented on a 24x45cm white tray
divided into three equal sections. Up to six possible novel
non-words (Horst & Samuelson, 2008) were randomly
selection for use with each child.
Procedure During the study, infants were seated across a
white table from the experimenter in a booster seat next to
their parents or in their parent’s lab. Parents completed the
MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory:
Words and Sentences (MCDI; Fenson et al, 1994) during
the session and were instructed to avoid interacting with
their child, only offering encouragement if necessary.
Pre-familiarization. Half the children began the session
with a one minute familiarization period with six novel
objects. The experimenter drew the infant’s attention to each
object by picking it up or by pointing to it and saying
“Look.” Once the infant had explored each object, the
experimenter lined all six items along the middle of the
table and asked the infant to pick their favorite item. The
favorite item was then given back to the infant to explore
briefly. This was repeated twice more and the remaining
three non-favorites were then removed from the table. The
three favorite items were then used as the novel objects in
the experiment with the favorite item selected first being the
target during the novel referent selection trial.
The other half of the children began the session with a
familiarization period in which they were exposed to six
possible novel non-words. A 19-inch, 1280x1024 pixel
touch screen computer was presented on the table
approximately 24 cm in front of the child. The computer
screen showed six 241x241 pixel basic shapes (i.e. circle,
triangle, diamond, cross, square, octagon) in six different

2622

basic colors (i.e. red, purple, orange, green, yellow, blue) in
a 2x3 matrix with each item roughly 130 pixels away from
each other. The trial began when the buttons appeared on
the screen. The experimenter directed the infant’s attention
to the screen saying “Look! You can push the buttons!” and
then randomly touched a button, producing one of six
possible novel words. This was repeated until all buttons
had been pushed and thus all six of the novel words were
produced one time each. The experimenter then directed the
infant to push the buttons by asking “Can you push the
buttons?” If the infant did not respond, the experimenter
again demonstrated by randomly pushing each button once.
If the infant again did not respond, the experimenter
demonstrated the buttons a third time and encouraged the
infant to try themselves. At this point, if the infant refused
to push the buttons themselves, the experimenter then
randomly chose a button and pushed it multiple times to
familiarize the infant with one of the six novel names. There
were eight possible examples of each novel word varying in
intonation, pitch, and frequency, which were randomly
selected from at each button press. All words were spoken
by the same female experimenter who was running the
experimental session. After two minutes of familiarization
with the sounds, the computer was removed and the
experiment continued with the warm-up trials. The novel
name that was produced the most during the familiarization
period was used as the target name during the novel referent
selection trial.
Warm-up trials. For each infant, three known objects
were randomly chosen for use throughout the warm-up
trials. The experiment placed each of the items in a slot on
the tray, keeping the tray out of sight of the infant. The trial
began with the experimenter placing the tray on the table
and allowing the infant to examine the objects for three
seconds. The experimenter then asked the infant to get an
object (“Can you get the block”) and slid the tray forward.
Infants were prompted up to three times until a response
was given. Responses on these warm-up trials were
corrected or praised heavily as necessary. Infants were
asked for a different object in a different location across the
three warm-up trials.
Referent Mapping Trials. The referent selection trials
immediately followed the warm-up trials, proceeding in the
same manner except that no corrections or praise was given.
Each infant was presented with three sets of objects, each of
which included two known objects and one novel object.
The same three known objects used during warm-up were
used. On the first and third trials, infants were asked to get a
known object. On the second trial, infants were asked to get
a novel object (i.e. “Can you get the roke?”). Location of the
target item was counterbalanced across trials and
randomized across infants.
Delay Period. A five-minute delay followed the referent
selection trials. During the delay, the infant was allowed to
play in the waiting room. None of the items used during the
experiment were present during the delay.
Retention Trial. The delay period was immediately followed

by a single warm-up trial that proceeded in the same manner
as the previous warm-up trials and used the same three
known objects. Praise was given and infants were corrected
as needed. The warm-up trial was immediately followed by
the retention trial in which the infant was presented with the
three novel objects present during the referent mapping
trials, one of which had been named in the second trial and
two of which were distracters present when the
experimenter had asked for a known objects on trials one
and three. The position of items was randomized across
infants with the target item never being in the same location
it had been during the referent selection trial.

Results
Infants chose the target significantly more than would be
expected by chance on novel referent selection trials in both
conditions, as seen in Table 1. In particular, 13 out of 19
infants familiarized with the novel object selected it when
asked during referent selection as did 18 out of 20
familiarized with the word form; exact binomial, p <.01 and
p<.001 respectively, see Table 1. These results are similar
to those of Horst and Samuelson (2008; see also Mervis &
Bertrand, 1994; Wilkinson et al, 2003). In contrast to Horst
and Samuelson (2008), however, infants familiarized with
the object prior to referent selection chose the target object
at levels significantly greater than chance on the retention
trials (10 out of 13, exact binomial, p<.01, note that only
data from the infants who correctly mapped in the novel
referent selection trials were included in this analysis).
Infants familiarized with the word prior to referent selection,
in contrast, performed at chance levels on retention trials (6
out of 18, exact binomial, p ns).

To directly examine the difference between conditions,
we performed X2 tests of homogeneity of proportions. These
revealed no differences in referent selection performance
across conditions, X2 (1, N=39), ns, however, performance
in retention did differ significantly between conditions, X2
(1, N=31) <.05. Thus, it appears that familiarization with
the novel object, but not the novel word, prior to the
formation of a novel word-object mapping boosts retention
of that mapping.
However, before accepting this conclusion we examine
the possible role differences between our task and that of
prior studies, as well as differences between our conditions,
may have had on our findings.

retention test (8 out of 18, ns, note that again, only data from
infants who correctly mapped in the novel referent selection
trials were included in this analysis). Chi-square tests of
homogeneity of proportions revealed that while there was a
difference in referent selection performance between infants
in Horst and Samuelson (2008) and infants here, X2 (1,
N=40), <.05, there was no significant difference in retention
between the two groups, X2 (1, N=28), ns. With respect to
Experiment 1, then, these results indicate that easing the
task by using the same known stimuli throughout did boost
children’s mapping ability during initial referent selection,
but it was likely not responsible for the boost in retention
seen when infants were familiarized with the novel objects.

Experiment 2: No Familiarization

Experiment 3: Non-Favorite Novel Target

One difference between our current procedure and that of
Horst and Samuelson (2008) was our use of the same three
known objects during warm-up and test. Pilot testing
demonstrated that with both a familiarization period and
different known objects on every trial, infants could not
succeed in referent selection and thus, retention could not be
analyzed. Thus, in Experiment 1 we had used the same
known objects on each trial in an effort to direct children’s
attention to the novel object even more, thereby boosting
infants’ initial mapping during referent selection. However,
it is possible that our repeated use of the same known
objects on every trial also served to boost retention. We
examine this possibility by testing retention in our
procedure without the familiarization period, thus
demonstrating that using the same three known items serves
to boost referent selection but not retention.

One possible explanation for the difference in retention
performance seen for children familiarized with the objects
versus the words in Experiment 1 has to do with our use of
the child’s favorite object as the novel target. Recall that
during familiarization we asked children for their three
favorite items from the set of six novel objects, using these
as the novel items present during referent selection. When
then asked to find the target item during the retention trial
when all three were present, children would be scored as
correct if they chose their overall favorite item, even if they
did not recall its link to the novel name. To test this
possibility, we re-ran the object familiarization condition of
Experiment 1, but instead used the non-favorite items as the
novel items during referent selection.

Method
Participants Twenty 24-month-old infants (9 girls, M = 24
months, 19 days; range = 23 months, 20 days – 25 months,
4 days) with a mean vocabulary of 342 words (range = 134536) participated. All infants were recruited through county
birth records and were native English speakers. Participant’s
parents provided informed consent prior to the start of the
study. Participants received a small toy for participation.
Data for one additional infant was not included due to a
recording error.
Stimuli The same novel objects and novel names from
Experiment 1 were used (see Figure 1).
Procedure The procedure was identical to that of
Experiment 1, with the exception that there was no prefamiliarization period.

Participants Twenty 24-month-old infants (11 girls; M = 24
months, 22 days; range = 23 months, 21 days-25 months, 3
days) with a mean vocabulary of 272 words (18-567)
participated. All infants were recruited through county birth
records and were native English speakers. Participant’s
parents provided informed consent prior to the start of the
study. Participants received a small toy for participation.
Stimuli The same novel objects and novel names from
Experiment 1 were used (see Figure 1).
Procedure The procedure was identical to the visual
condition in Experiment 1, with the exception that when
asked to pick their favorite novel item during
familiarization, that item was then removed from the table.
This was repeated until three non-favorite items were
remaining. These three remaining items were then used as
the novel referents during the experiment.

of proportions revealed that there was no significant
difference in referent selection, X2 (1, N=39), ns, or
retention X2 (1, N=27), ns, between infants familiarized with
the object in Experiment 1 and infants here. These results
then indicate that the use of the infant’s favorite novel
object as the target during referent selection did not alter the
infant’s ability to retain the word-object link after a delay.

General Discussion
Despite the complexity of word learning, young children are
remarkable at quickly mapping a novel word to a novel
object. However, recent work has suggested that this
mapping may not be as robust as previously thought, and
thus, not the basis of children’s rapid acquisition of new
words. The goal of the present set of experiments was to
probe how prior familiarity with the parts of a novel nameobject mapping may help children retain novel name-object
links. The results indicate that children given prior
familiarity with the novel object to be mapped retained the
mapping between the object and a novel word following a
delay. In contrast, children given prior familiarity with the
word-form mapped the novel word to a novel object during
referent selection, but did not retain this mapping over a
delay. Even when repetition of known objects and novel
item preference were controlled for, children still
demonstrated retention of a word-object mapping when
familiarized with the object prior to test. Thus, our results
indicate an important difference in the word-learning boost
given by familiarity with the objects verses familiarity with
the words in a fast-mapping task.
Importantly, the results of Experiments 1 and 3 support
previous suggestions that a slow-mapping process (Carey,
1978; Carey & Bartlett, 1978) is needed for a robust
mapping between a word and object. Notably, however, the
results also demonstrate that prior familiarity with the
object, but not the word, to be mapped helps this process. A
similar idea has been presented in a recent model of word
learning proposed by Mayor and Plunkett (2010). In this
model, fast-mapping is facilitated by a well-developed
representation of the object category prior to the actual
name-object mapping. Likewise, our findings are also
consistent with previous work by Smith and Yu (2008)
suggesting that multiple exposures to a novel name and
object are necessary for learning (see also McMurray, Horst
& Samuelson, in prep; and Horst, McMurray, & Samuelson,
2006). It is clear from the literature that with more
experience or information, children’s ability to make
specific word-object mappings is heightened (see also,
Horst, 2007; and McMurray, Horst & Samuelson, in prep;
Horst, Samuelson, & McMurray, 2010). One implication of
the current study is the suggestion that across multiple
exposures, visual and auditory components may not have
been encoded equivalently. The literature presents several
interesting suggestions as to why this might be the case.

One possible interpretation of the differential effects of
word and object familiarization in our results comes from
Sloutsky and colleagues’ proposal of auditory dominance
(Robinson & Sloutsky, 2004; Robinson & Sloutsky, 2007;
Robinson & Sloutsky, 2008; Sloutsky & Napolitano, 2003;
Sloutsky & Robinson, 2008). This is the suggestion that
when both auditory and visual information are given to
infants simultaneously, the auditory information receives
preferentially processing. Support for this idea comes from
studies in which infants were trained that a particular
combination of auditory and visual stimuli indicated the
location of a prize. When presented with either the trained
auditory or visual cue paired with a competing auditory or
visual cue, infants relied more on the auditory modality to
anticipate the location of the prize (Robinson & Sloutsky,
2004; Robinson & Sloutsky, 2007). This theory would
suggest that in Horst & Samuelson’s (2008) referent
selection task when infants were only given a single
exposure to the novel object and name, they preferentially
processed the auditory information and thus, only encoded
half of the mapping – the novel name, not the physical
referent. In the current study, the theory of auditory
dominance would suggest that the familiarization period had
a differential effect on infant’s processing of novel names
and objects at the point of referent selection. If infants come
to the task with an auditory processing bias and are given
additional familiarity with the visual component prior to
test, when the word and object were presented during
referent selection, both components could be processed at
equivalent levels, allowing both the word and object to be
encoded robustly. On the other hand, when infants were prefamiliarized with the word-form, the auditory processing
was boosted even further, thus overshadowing the encoding
of the visual object during referent selection.
It is also possible, however, that the apparent difference in
visual and auditory familiarization stems more from task
demands than differential processing of each component.
That is, perhaps the use of a comprehension task to test
retention creates the appearance of processing differences.
In the traditional fast-mapping task, the experimenter
provides the word during testing. When the infants are prefamiliarized with the objects and the experimenter provides
the word during the retention task, children would then have
both components necessary to demonstrate robust retention
of the word-object link. On the other hand, when infants are
pre-familiarized with the words and again given the word at
test, the infants only have a rich encoding of the auditory
component and do not demonstrate retention of the link. By
this view then, the object familiarization condition did
provide a boost to word learning, not because infants are
biased to process the word form, but rather, because the task
privileged the modality in which the children would
subsequently use to find the referent.
It may be possible to discriminate between these
explanations by examining the strength of the
representations of the word and object following the initial
referent selection trials without a pre-familiarization period.

Sloutsky’s auditory dominance proposal would suggest that
in a recognition test following referent selection, infants
should show recognition of the words, but not the objects. In
contrast, if the differences in results in our experiment are
due to task effects, infants should show no encoding of the
auditory information following referent selection. These
results would also give insight to the extent to which
familiarization might boost the representation of the
category, as Mayor and Plunkett (2010) predict in their
model. We are currently examining this possibility.
While further research is required to elucidate the exact
depth to which object and word forms are processed by
infants in a fast-mapping task, the current study makes it
clear that the novel words and objects presented for
mapping play different roles in the establishment of that
mapping and in its retention. Thus, our finding that infants
retain novel word-object mappings when familiarized with
the objects but not the words reinforces Horst &
Samuelson’s (2008) and Carey’s (1978) point that fast
mapping is not equivalent to word learning. Our results also
point to the importance of further work into the incremental
process by which representations of words, objects and their
mappings are created on the way to word learning.
