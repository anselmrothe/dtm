the original hypothesis. However we must exercise caution
in the interpretation of these results. Because we employed a
free-operant paradigm, it is possible that participants’
response behavior differed between conditions, resulting in
different objective response-outcome contingencies (cf.
Buehner & May, 2003). If any such differences occurred

Method
Participants
   32 participants, recruited as those in Experiment 1,
completed the experiment to receive either £3 payment or
course credit.
Design
   Trial Length was either 2s or 5s as in the previous
experiment, and Salience was either standard (no tone) or
enhanced (tone present). Accordingly this gave four
conditions which were presented in a blocked
counterbalanced design as in the previous experiment.
Apparatus, materials & procedure
   As before, except that in the enhanced conditions, the
outcome was accompanied by the auditory tone, and
participants received the following extra instructions:                 Figure 2: Mean causal ratings for Experiment 2A. Error

Results & Discussion
Causal Ratings
   Figure 3 suggests that the auditory pulse did not alleviate
the effect of delay. Interestingly however, it does seem that
the presence of the pulse did improve judgments of
causality across the board; both for 2s and 5s, although it
did not noticeably improve judgments at 5s relative to 2s.
This general effect could be due to a slowing down of the
internal pacemaker by the auditory pulse. Studies have
provided evidence that human time perception is determined               Figure 3: Mean causal ratings for Experiment 2B. Error

overcoming the problem of circularity that hampers the
causal mechanism view. It may well be that in the absence
of clear structural information, other sources of knowledge
(such as expectations based on previously acquired
mechanistic beliefs) serve to divide the event stream into
meaningful patterns of event co-occurrence. Importantly, we
have shown that such beliefs are not necessary when
structural information is apparent in the input, and
furthermore, that such information serves to overcome the
well-established detrimental effects of reinforcement delay.
