Abstract

for responses beginning with plosive segments is typically
50 – 100 ms slower than responses beginning with nonplosive segments, although this difference can be as short
as 20 ms in speeded naming tasks (see Kawamoto, Kello,
Jones & Bame, 1998). Notably, the plosivity effect can be
completely eliminated in some tasks (Kawamoto, Liu,
Mura, & Sanchez, 2008), or enhanced in others (Liu,
Kawamoto, & Grebe, 2009).

In this paper, we consider articulatory processes in a
connectionist model of reading aloud to account for effects
of manner of articulation of the initial segment in a variety
of tasks. We first describe experimental results showing
how flexibility in articulation can completely eliminate the
a priori acoustic latency difference between plosives and
non-plosives in some tasks, and exaggerate this difference
in other tasks. We then simulate an expanded version of the
Connectionist Incremental Articulation Model that
incorporates Stevens’ (1998) 3 phases involved in
articulating a speech segment.

The Elimination of the Plosivity Effect
In a study examining the temporal relationship between
the onsets of the articulatory and acoustic responses in the
delayed naming task, participants were presented with the
complete stimulus (a monosyllabic word) at the beginning
of a trial and were told to respond as quickly and
accurately as possible only after a signal to respond was
given, which was given after a delay. Using stimuli that
began with the segments /p/, /t/, /m/, and /n/, Kawamoto
and colleagues found that what constituted the initiation
of the response to participants was the onset of the
acoustic response, despite the fact that for long delays, the
onset of the articulatory response occurred before the
signal to respond. In essence, participants were moving
their articulators into the optimal position for the
phonation of the acoustic response while they were
waiting for the signal to respond. For sufficiently long
delays, that meant holding the acoustic response in
abeyance until the signal to respond was detected. For
responses beginning with non-plosive segments (/m/ and
/n/), that meant holding the response at the cusp of the
second articulatory phase, whereas for responses
beginning with plosive segments (/p/ and /t/), it was held
at the cusp of the third articulatory phase.
Basically, when participants were afforded the
opportunity (i.e., long delays) to not only form the
appropriate oral constriction (phase 1), but also build the
required intra-oral pressure (phase 2) for plosive initial
segments, the plosivity effect disappeared completely. But
when there was insufficient time for the first two phases
to be completed for plosive initial segments (i.e., short
delays), a plosivity effect could still be observed, although
the magnitude of the plosivity effect diminishes as a
function of delay.

The Precise Articulatory Sequence in the
Production of Individual Sounds
Researchers have known that the onset of the articulatory
response occurs long before the onset of the acoustic
response (Bell-Berti & Harris, 1981). This asynchrony
between the onset of articulatory and acoustic responses is
due to the fact that individual sounds are produced in
three distinct articulatory phases: (1) the movements of
the articulators toward the formation of the oral
constriction; (2) the flow of air behind or around the oral
constriction; and (3) the release of the current constriction
and movement toward the next constriction (Stevens,
1998).
The exact point at which the acoustic event is produced
in the sequence above for initial segments that differed in
manner can be distinguished according to their specific
articulatory requirements. For non-plosive segments such
as /m/, /l/, /r/, /s/, etc., acoustic energy can be generated
shortly after their respective oral constriction are formed.
However, for plosive segments such as /p/, /t/, /k/, etc.,
acoustic energy can be generated only after (a) the
buildup of sufficient intra-oral pressure, and (b) the
release of the current oral constriction. That is, acoustic
onset for non-plosive segments occurs during the second
phase, whereas for plosive segments, it occurs during the
third.

The Plosivity Effect
This differential requirement for the production of the
acoustic events of plosive and non-plosive segments is the
basis for the Plosivity Effect. Because the acoustic event
for plosive segments requires the buildup of the intra-oral
pressure, the onset of acoustic energy (acoustic latency)

The Enhancement of the Plosivity Effect
In a different study, which examined the minimal unit of
phonological information needed to initiate articulation
(i.e., minimal unit of articulation), participants again
produced monosyllabic utterances that began with the

2284

segments /p/, /t/, /m/, and /n/ under a variant of the
delayed naming task, called the pair-wise priming task
(Liu, Kawamoto, & Grebe, 2009).
Procedurally, the pair-wise priming task is identical to
the delayed naming task except that instead of presenting
the complete stimulus at the beginning of the trial, only
the initial letter was presented (e.g., m__). The complete
stimulus (e.g., mood) was presented only after a variable
delay (i.e., stimulus onset asynchrony or SOA) of 300 ms
or 600 ms.
The key issue was whether or not the initial segment
was sufficient for a participant to initiate the articulatory
response or even the acoustic response. Liu and
colleagues (2009) found that participants could in fact
initiate the articulatory response on the basis of the initial
segment alone. In fact, in the 600 ms SOA condition,
articulatory onset for both plosive and non-plosive
segments on average occurred before the presentation of
the complete stimulus.
The next issue is whether knowledge beyond the initial
segment is required to initiate the acoustic response. If the
acoustic response can be initiated on the basis on the
initial segment alone in certain conditions, one can
lengthen the acoustic event for these segments until the
subsequent segment becomes available. Indeed, for
nasals, a 10.08 ms increase in the mean acoustic segment
duration was observed in the 600 ms SOA condition
compared with the 300 ms SOA condition (see Figure 1).
In fact, in certain trials, acoustic onset occurred prior to
the presentation of the complete stimulus. Although the
total number of trials where this was observed was limited
to 6 out of 474 trials in total, they represent a clear
existence proof that for non-plosive initial segments, the
acoustic response can be initiated based on knowledge of
the initial segment alone.

segments were almost identical across the different
priming conditions (58.91 ms and 58.72 ms for the 300
ms and 600ms SOA, resp.). So, despite the fact that
initiation of the articulatory response for plosive initial
segments does not require knowledge of the subsequent
segment, the initiation of the acoustic response is
contingent on the following segment.
Given that the initiation of the acoustic response for
plosive initial segments must wait until the next segment
is known but it does not for non-plosive segments, the
onset of the acoustic response for non-plosive initial
segments can be initiated much earlier than plosive initial
segments, particularly in the 600 ms SOA condition. This
differential constraint is what was driving the 16.64 ms
enhancement of the plosivity effect on acoustic latency
observed across the different priming conditions (i.e., the
difference between the 17.77 ms plosivity effect in the
300 ms SOA condition and the 34.42 ms plosivity effect
in the 600 ms SOA condition as illustrated in Figure 1).
Individual Differences: A Case for multiple Response
Criteria. Although the results of Liu and colleagues’
(2009) study represent the strongest evidence to date that
participants can initiate both the articulatory and acoustic
responses before the full phonological code of a word is
generated, not all participants behaved in this manner. In
fact, there is a wide range of individual differences.

Figure 2: Data for two participants (1 and 12)
reported by Liu et al., (2009). The articulatory
onset to acoustic onset interval (AAI) is shown in
red, and the acoustic segment duration is shown in
green.
At one extreme (e.g., participant 1 in Figure 2), there
are participants who initiated the articulatory response
shortly after the prime is processed and long before the
complete stimulus is presented. In a sense, data from
these participants typified a response strategy where
articulation is based on a segmental criterion (cf.
Kawamoto et al., 1998). For these participants,
articulation of the initial segment was necessarily
lengthened because articulation of the initial segment was
initiated before the subsequent segment was available.
Since information for the next segment comes much later
in the 600 ms SOA condition, these participants showed
the largest AAI and acoustic segment duration effects (for
nasals). When the difference in the SOA is taken into
account, there is virtually no difference in when the
articulatory response is initiated (articulatory latency)

Figure 1: The acoustic segment durations (left) and
acoustic latencies (right) of plosive and nasal initial
segments across priming conditions reported by
Liu et al., (2009).
However, the results for plosive initial segments
differed from those for nasals. For plosives, acoustic onset
corresponds to the explosive release of pent up pressure
that require knowledge of the following segment (i.e.,
phase 3), and thus acoustic onset always occurs some time
after the complete target is presented. Moreover, because
this release of pressure occurs more or less in an all or
none fashion, plosive segments are relatively resistant to
acoustic lengthening. Indeed, acoustic duration for plosive

relative to the presentation of the prime.
At the same time, there are also participants who,
despite the fact that the prime provided sufficient
information to initiate articulation, chose to wait until
more information becomes available. These participants
(e.g., Participant 12 in Figure 3) typified a response
strategy where articulation is based on the whole word
criterion (cf. Kawamoto et al., 1998). For these
participants there was little or no difference in when and
how the response was executed across priming conditions.

to the current articulatory phase, the syllabic position of
the segment being produced, and a small set of
articulatory dimensions: the velar opening, the positions
of the tongue tip and tongue body, the vertical and
horizontal lip separations, the degree of intra-oral
pressure, the constriction of the glottis, and acoustic
intensity. Phase 1 of a word medial segment overlaps in
the current output representation with phase 3 of the
previous segment to convey the fact that these two phases
are one and the same (see Table 1).

Model Architecture

The Incremental Articulation Account: An
Expanded Implementation

The current model consists of two linked networks — a
phonological network that provides the input to an
articulatory network (see Figure 3).

In this section, we describe an expanded implementation
of the Incremental Articulation Account (Kawamoto et
al., 1998). The core assumptions of the incremental
account are that (1) the minimal unit of articulation is the
segment, (2) multiple response criteria can be used, and
(3) when articulation is initiated on a segment by segment
basis, the articulation of the current segment/s may be
lengthened to accommodate the time needed to process
the subsequent segments.
The goal of the initial implementation of this model
was to account for anticipatory coarticulation and
segment duration effects (Kawamoto and Liu, 2007). The
goal of the current implementation is to expand the
generality of this model by demonstrating how the
elimination and enhancement of the plosivity effect can
be accounted for when the precise sequence of
articulatory events involved in articulation is considered.

The Phonological Network
The phonological network consists of three distinct
components: a Phonological Buffer, a Response Criterion
layer, and a Buffer Control structure. The Phonological
Buffer functions simply as a temporary storage
mechanism for the phonological code generated by the
preceding processes such as phonological encoding (not
modeled here). The Response Criterion layer denotes the
particular set of response criteria used. In the current
implementation there are three sets of units: (1) the
Instruction units, (2) the Lengthening Criterion units, and
(3) the Articulation Criterion units.
The Instruction units were designed to mimic the effect
of instructions on the precise articulatory juncture that
participants decide to hold the response in abeyance (i.e.,
{1, 0, 0} denotes articulatory onset, {0, 1, 0} denotes the
acoustic onset, and {0, 0, 1} denotes vocalic onset). Their
specific function in this implementation is to simulate the
results of the delayed naming task. The Lengthening
Criterion units dictate the manner in which a verbal
response will be lengthened (i.e., {1, 0} for articulatory
lengthening, and {0, 1} for acoustic lengthening).

The Representations Used
The
input
representation
for
the
current
implementation, as in Kawamoto and Liu (2007), is a slot
based local representation scheme that specifies the
segmental content, syllabic frame, and encoding status of
a metrical slot (see Table 1). The output and state
representations in the current implementation correspond

2286

Jordan Net. The basic architecture of the Jordan net in
the current implementation remains relatively unchanged
from that in Kawamoto and Liu (2007). As in Kawamoto
and Liu (2007), the connections between Output-to-State
and State-to-State are one-to-one. The decay parameter is
set to equal 1 (i.e., δ=1; no decay). Due to the actions of
the Sigma-Pi connections from the control structure (see
below), only the output of a single sweep will be buffered
in the State units at any given time. Accordingly, the
values of the State and Output Units are always offset by
1 sweep.
Articulatory Control Structure. The control structure is
a simple feed forward network that acts as a monitoring
and gating mechanism that takes input from the
Instruction
units,
Articulation
Criterion
units,
Lengthening Criterion units, and partial input from the
Plan and State units.
The control structure checks the articulatory phase of
the segment currently being produced with the availability
of the following segment and gates the progress of the
Jordan net according to the instruction or lengthening
criterion specified by the criterion units. If information
about the following segment is available, the output of the
Jordan net will naturally move from producing the
articulatory sequence of the current segment to those of
the next. If not, the model will simply prolong the
production of the articulatory phase/s according to the
lengthening criterion specified. This control is
accomplished by taking as inputs the Unspecified
Segment units and the Metrical Slot units (i.e., the “-“ and
“$” units) from the Plan units and the Current
Articulatory Phase units from the State units. The
Unspecified Segment units denote whether or not the
identity of a particular segment is unknown (1=”on” or
unknown), the Metrical Slot units denote whether or not a
particular metrical slot is specified in the word frame
(1=”on” or specified), and the Current Articulatory Phase
units denote the syllabic position and articulatory phase of
the segment produced in the previous sweep. Together,
these units feed into 2 control units, one for the Sigma-Pi
connections to the Output-to-State connections and the
other for the Sigma-Pi connections to the State-to-State
connections, and turn them “on” or “off” accordingly. The
specific operation of the Sigma-Pi connections under
different situations is discussed in the simulation below.

Figure 3: The basic architecture of the current model.
The black arrows denote full connectivity with the
exception that the connections between Output-toState and State-to-State are one-to-one. The gray
arrows denote that only some inputs are fed into the
next layer (see discussion below).
Instruction and Lengthening Criterion units are fed
directly into the Articulatory Control structure (see
below), while the Articulatory Criterion units are fed into
the Buffer Control structure. The Buffer Control structure,
which also takes input from the unspecified segment and
Metrical Slot units in the Phonological Buffer (i.e., “-“
and “$” units), monitors the content of the Phonological
Buffer and gates the flow of information to the
articulatory network according the specific articulation
criterion used.
Phonological Gating. The gating of information from the
Phonological Buffer to the articulatory network is carried
out by the Buffer Control units through Sigma-Pi
connections from the Phonological Buffer to the
Articulatory Plan (Buffer-to-Plan connections). All of the
Buffer-to-Plan connections will be turned “off” initially
for the whole word criterion (i.e., {0, 1}). They are turned
“on” only when the segments in each of the specified
metrical slots are known (i.e., when all of the Unspecified
Segment units, “-“, are 0 or off). If the segment criterion
is used (i.e., {1, 0}), all of the Buffer-to-Plan connections
will be turned “on” from the very beginning. Thus, the
flow of information from buffer to plan will always be
unrestricted. In this respect, under the segment criterion,
an incomplete syllabic code can be fed into the articulator
network and incrementally updated to reflect ongoing
processing, whereas under the whole word criterion, only
the complete syllabic code is fed to the articulatory
network.

Training Network
The Jordan net was trained on the Tlearn simulator
(Plunkett & Elman, 1997). The training corpus for the
Jordan net consisted of the input and output sequences
corresponding to a small lexicon consisting of words such
as mood, neat, pit, pale, etc. Training was carried out for
5000 epochs, with a learning rate = 0.05 and momentum
= 0. Because the behavior of the Articulatory Control
structure is just that of a simple table lookup, its operation
was hardwired in the current simulation. The specific
conditions that trigger its operation are discussed below.

The Articulatory Network
The articulatory network consists of two primary
components, an Articulatory Control structure that is
coupled to a Jordan net (Jordan, 1986).

2287

Testing the Network

acoustic energy is lengthened until the signal to respond is
detected (i.e., sweep 10). Specifically, the Sigma-Pi
connections to the Output-to-State connections were
turned “on” and the connections to the State-to-State
connections were turned “off” on the 5th sweep for nonplosive sequences and on the 6th sweep for plosive
sequences. These actions turn the Jordan net into a feed
forward network that simply updates the output of the
earlier sweep. In essence, the articulation of the first
articulatory phase for non-plosive sequences was
lengthened until sweep 10, whereas for plosive sequences
it was the second articulatoy phase. When the Sigma-Pi
units switch back to their default state on sweep 10, the
articulatory network turned back into the Jordan net and
produced the next articulation phase (phase 2 for nonplosives and phase 3 for plosives) in sweep 10 and for the
remainder of the response in subsequent sweeps.
Since acoustic energy is generated in Phase 2 for nonplosive initial segments, and phase 3 for plosive initial
segments, the output of the test sequences demonstrate
that, due to the input from the Instruction units, acoustic
energy for these test sequences are generated in
synchronicity in sweep 8 — an elimination of the
plosivity effect.

Simulation of certain key results of the delayed naming
experiment reported by Kawamoto et al., (2008) and the
pair-wise priming task reported by Liu et al., (2009) were
carried out. For the delayed naming task, our interest
focused on simulating the elimination of the plosivity
effect at long delays. For the pair-wise priming task, the
result of interest to us was the enhancement of the
plosivity effect driven by participants using the segment
response criterion. To demonstrate the malleability of the
plosivity effect as well as the differential lengthening of
the articulatory and acoustic responses, the outputs of the
Articulatory Network were computed offline from the
weight matrices of the Jordan net and the Articulatory
Control Structure.
Delayed Naming. The test sequences for delayed naming
were simply the training sequences lengthened to 17
sweeps for test sequences beginning with plosive
segments and 18 for non-plosive sequences. For both test
sets, the neutral state was presented for the first 4 sweeps
to represent the time that it takes for the phonological
code to be generated. The complete syllabic code is
presented in the 5th sweep and remained so until the 14th
sweep for plosive test sequences and the 15th sweep for
non-plosive sequences, after which both sets of test
sequences returned to neutral state on the final sweep.
Input from the Instruction units to the Articulatory
Control units were set at {0, 1, 0} (indicating that the
acoustic response will be held in abeyance) from sweeps
2-10 to indicate the time for the signal to respond to be
detected, after which the input was switched to {0, 0, 0}
for the remainder of each test sequence set.
The outputs of these test sequences clearly show that
for sequences beginning with plosive and non-plosive
segments, the articulatory phase prior to the generation of

Pair-wise Priming. Two different sets of test sequences
were used for the pair-wise priming task to simulate the
behavior of participants using different response criteria:
(1) the whole word, and (2) the segment criteria. The
sequence lengths for these input sets were 17 and 15,
respectively. For both test sets, the first 4 sweeps
represent the neutral state. On sweeps 5-9, a fragmentary
syllabic code consisting of information for the initial
segment only (e.g., m___ or p__) with the unspecified
segment represented by the “-“ unit in the appropriate
metrical slots. From sweeps 10 to the penultimate sweep,

the test sequences contained the complete syllabic code
(e.g., mood or pit); and neutral state on the final sweep
(see Table 2).
Inputs to the criterion units, specifically, the
Articulation Criterion and Lengthening Criterion units,
for the whole word criterion test set were set to {0, 1} and
{0, 0}, respectively. For the segment criterion test set, the
input was set to {1, 0} and {1, 0} on sweeps 1-7, and
switched to {1, 0} and {0, 1} for the remaining sweeps.
The output of the whole word test sets show that the
first articulatory phase of the initial segment for both
plosive and non-plosive test sequences was not produced
until sweep 10, and subsequent articulatory phases were
produced in each successive sweep until the entire
response was completed on sweep 16. This is because the
input from the Articulation Criterion units (i.e., {0, 1}) to
the Buffer Control units coupled with input from the
Unspecified Segment units (i.e., “-“ units ) in the
Phonological Buffer turned “on” the Sigma-Pi connection
from the Buffer Control units to the Buffer-to-Plan
connections, which effectively shut off input from the
Phonological Buffer units to the Plan units until the full
phonological code became available on sweep 10. Once
the Sigma-Pi connections to the Buffer-to-Plan
connections were turned “off”, the entire syllabic code
was then fed into the articulatory network, and the
syllabic response is produced uninterrupted. Because the
acoustic event for the initial segment was produced on the
11th sweep for non-plosive sequences, and on the 12th
sweep for plosive sequences, a plosivity effect of 1 sweep
was observed.
For the segment criterion test sets, the first articulatory
phase was produced on sweeps 5-7 for both the plosive
and non-plosive sequences because the initial segment
only became available on sweep 5. On sweep 8, the input
from the Lengthening Criterion units was switched to {0,
1}, at which point the action of the Articulatory Control
units reverts the Sigma-Pi connections to their default
state, thus, allowing the next articulatory (phase 2) to be
produced. However, on sweep 9, based on the input from
the Current Articulatory Phase units within the State units
(values offset from those within the Output Layer, shown
in Table 2, by 1 sweep), the Articulatory Control units
again turned “on” the Sigma-Pi connections to the
Output-to-State connections and turned “off” the SigmaPi connections to the State-to-State connections. Thus,
phase 2 was repeated on sweep 9 (see Table 2). When the
entire syllabic code became available on sweep 10, the
Sigma-Pi connections again revert back to its default state
allowing the remainder of the syllabic response to be
produced in subsequent sweeps. Accordingly, the acoustic
event for non-plosive sequences (phase 2) was produced
on sweep 8, whereas, for plosive sequences (phase 3), it
was produced on sweep 10, resulting in a plosivity effect
of 2 sweeps.
Although the output of these two test sets taken
together produced a mean plosivity effect of 1.50 sweeps

— a net plosivity enhancement of 0.50 sweeps, the exact
magnitude of the enhancement ultimately depends on the
proportion of participants using the segment criterion and
the whole word criterion.

Conclusion
The results of the current simulations demonstrate that a
single network using a sub-syllabic minimal unit and
different response criteria can account for both the
elimination and enhancement of the plosivity effect, as
well as the differential lengthening of the articulatory and
acoustic responses when the precise sequence of
articulatory events involved in the generation of the
individual sounds is taken into consideration. This
approach can easily be extended to other latency and
duration effects, both articulatory and acoustic, that can
arise from a variety of processing difficulties in speech
production. Moreover, with slight modifications, the
current network can be easily coupled to existing models,
such as the one described by Dell, Juliano, and Govindjee
(1993) to account for a wider range of empirical data
(e.g., latency data). Such an extension provides a way to
explore the intricate coordination between different
processing stages, and how potential asynchronies in the
flow of information may reveal themselves in the
interplay between different dependent measures such as
articulatory latency, acoustic latency, and the duration of
various components of a verbal response.
