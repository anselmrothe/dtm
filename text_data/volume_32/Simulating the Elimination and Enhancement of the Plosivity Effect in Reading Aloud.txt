In fact, in certain trials, acoustic onset occurred prior to
the presentation of the complete stimulus. Although the
total number of trials where this was observed was limited
to 6 out of 474 trials in total, they represent a clear
existence proof that for non-plosive initial segments, the
acoustic response can be initiated based on knowledge of
the initial segment alone.
