is to find out what relation holds in the first pair of objects,
turn it into propositional form (e.g. ‘is used to cut(axe,
wood)’), do the same for the second pair of objects and than
compare the two symbolic structures. This is what many
models of relational reasoning do (Gentner, 1983;
Falkenhainer, Forbus, & Gentner, 1989). Some models can
also establish a correspondence between distinct relational
symbols by measuring their semantic similarity (Holyoak &
Thagard, 1989; Kokinov, 1994; Hummel & Holyoak, 1997,
2003). However all these models do not address the problem

non-dominant hand implied that subjects tried to
simultaneously simulate the actions involved in the two
relations. A control study ruled out the possibility that this
result was due to the mere perception of objects with
varying affordances. However it is still possible the effect
was due to presenting the two relations at once. Another
valid point is that the overall reaction time could have been
affected mostly by the affordance of the relation displayed
near the subjects’ non-dominant hand because it was harder
to be simulated. Also the design of the experiment did not
allow to control the sequence in which the subjects look at
the two relations. Therefore it is possible that the effect of
the relation which had been attended last was different                 Figure 2a: A left and a right affordance of a pair of

problems.
                       Experiment 1
The experiment used the same stimuli as V&K, but the
relations were displayed one by one in the center of the
screen in order to control the order in which they were
perceived and isolate the effect of the presentation location.
   The elimination of the factor of the presentation location
served to set apart the effect of the affordances of the stimuli
from any spatial compatibility effects. It is well known that

compatible to the response action (Simon & Rudell, 1967).               Figure 2b: Examples of the stimuli used in ‘same’ and
