Abstract: How do multiple labeling events influence children’s understanding of objects that can be named at
multiple levels of specificity (”Rover” or ”dog”)? To investigate, we replicated Xu & Tenenbaum (2007, Psychological
Review, 114, 245-272), who found that children generalized more narrowly when three identical toys (e.g., plush
Dalmatians) were labeled with a novel word compared to one toy labeled three times. Xu & Tenenbaum suggested
the extra two referents provide statistical evidence that rationally supports a narrow hypothesis. In our ”extra
labeling” condition, however, children generalized broadly when each object was labeled ten times instead of once.
This violates the predictions of a purely rational account and suggests situational, lower-level processes are critical
to novel word generalization. A Dynamic Neural Field model is used to examine these processes, and further shows
how process-oriented models can solve the problem of overlapping extensions.
