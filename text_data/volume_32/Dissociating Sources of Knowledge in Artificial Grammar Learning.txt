   However, although it was originally assumed that rule
knowledge is implicit and exemplar-based knowledge is
explicit (e.g. Reber 1989), the true picture appears to be
much more complex. For instance, participants in a study
by Dulany, Carlson, and Dewey (1984) were able to indicate
which parts of letter strings were grammatical by crossing
out ungrammatical portions, possibly suggesting some
explicit knowledge of rules. Similarly, participants in
another study demonstrated explicit knowledge of the
grammar by being able to complete stems of letter strings to
form grammatical strings (Dienes, Broadbent, & Berry,              Figure 1: Hypothesized Pathways to Knowledge in

    Experiment 2: Dissociating Implicit Rule-
       Based from Exemplar-Based Learning
   In Experiment 1, we forced the dual-task participants to
rely on implicit learning to learn both exemplar and rule-
based information. The aim of Experiment 2 was to attempt
to remove an additional pathway to learning, namely
implicit perceptual fluency, a form of exemplar based
knowledge (see Figure 2), leaving only the implicit rule-
based system hypothesized by Reber (1967).
   In order to remove the availability of perceptual
exemplar-based cues, we incorporated the “transfer”
methodology described earlier. Specifically, participants
were required to do the test classification task on test strings      Figure 4: Proportion of Correct Grammaticality
