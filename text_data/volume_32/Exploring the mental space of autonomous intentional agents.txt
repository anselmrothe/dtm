behaviors.1 We programmed the triangular agents to behave
autonomously, each running its own independent program.
Inspired by the work of Braitenberg (1984), we aimed to cre-
ate rule-governed agents which, notwithstanding the simplic-
ity of their programs, yield vivid and lifelike behaviors that
give subjects a strong impression of intentions.
Agent design Rather than presenting subjects with pre-
fabricated animations, we populate simulations with au-
tonomous agents and then allow these simulations to run for a
predetermined length of time (15 seconds). Each agent starts
off in the simulation environment with a randomly-assigned
velocity and location. The agent always orients one vertex of
its triangular body (that which lay on its axis of symmetry)
in the direction of its movement, inducing the impression that
the front end is the agent’s “head” (see Tremoulet & Feldman,
2000). When an agent either collides with another agent or                 Figure 1: Screenshot from Experiment 1 (colors inverted), with
