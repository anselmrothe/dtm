Abstract: Although the intention behind including illustrations alongside expository text is generally to increase
student motivation, interest, or understanding, images do not always have beneficial effects. Generally, students
tend to have poor comprehension when learning from expository science texts. Further, they also tend to have poor
metacomprehension accuracy, meaning they are not able to differentiate what they have understood well, from what
they have understood poorly. In the current study, the inclusion of either conceptual or seductive images actually
increased comprehension as compared to a no-image condition. The inclusion of images also tended to increase
readersâ€™ interest in the texts. However, including seductive images decreased metacomprehension accuracy compared
to the no-image condition. This suggests that seductive images may provide readers with a false sense of fluency or
understanding which could potentially undermine effective self-regulation and studying behaviors.
