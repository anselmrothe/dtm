Auditory stimuli
We recorded 48 sentences with normal speech tempo. Lo-
cally coherent sequences were recorded separately – as main
clauses (Der Sohn kämmte sich im Wohnzimmer . . . ) – and
spliced into surrounding sentences (without the starting de-
terminer of the LSC to prevent sentence-initial prosody). By
doing so, we wanted to minimize prosodic cues induced by
the relative clause boundary and thereby destroying the lo-
cal coherence. To minimize prosodic differences between
conditions, control conditions were produced by splicing the
adverbs (gründlich/thoroughly) into the first two conditions.
This method was necessary since earlier findings indicated
strong sensitivity to prosodic cues (Konieczny et al., 2009).
These effects are outside the scope of this study. The result-
