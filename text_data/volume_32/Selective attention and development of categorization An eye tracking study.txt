Stimuli consisted of triads of artificial creatures, which
were irrelevant components of the task. Each triad also
included three rows of circles (referred to as cookies that
creatures eat). Examples of stimulus triads are presented
in Figures 1-3. These cookies were the critical features
that participants were instructed to focus on in the current
matching task. To make the irrelevant features
perceptually more salient, creatures were bigger and
colorful, while the critical features were smaller and
shared the same color. The only difference for the critical
features was different patterns on the cookies. Two had
wave lines on them while the remaining one had diagonal
lines. The irrelevant features were drawn from two
categories. One category consisted of objects with hands
and feet, and the other consisted of bug-like objects with
wings and tails. In each triad, the bottom object was the               Figure 2: An example in the conflict condition
