   This paper extends the table-based training time
predictions of Matessa and Polson (2006) by presenting a
computational model that represents procedure training as
list learning. The model is meant to describe training
programs where to-be-learned procedures are formally
trained, and trainees must demonstrate mastery before they
can go on to more advanced, on-the-job training. Airline
transition training programs are examples of this paradigm.
The model takes as input the number of steps in a procedure
and the time per step, and it generates estimates of the
training time required to master the procedure. Predictions
of the model are compared to human data and show the
benefit of the number-of-steps and step-time parameters.
