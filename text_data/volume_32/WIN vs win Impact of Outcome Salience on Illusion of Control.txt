On the other hand, emphasizing the salience of positive
outcomes should enhance the bias, therefore leading to an
increase of the illusion.
   The goal of the present study was to directly test the
hypothesis that attentional mechanisms are involved both in
the judgment of control and in the memory for events, in the
CJT. We asked observers to estimate their control over an
outcome in an active CJT, by pressing one of two buttons in
the attempt to maximize their winnings. In the present
