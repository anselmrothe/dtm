coping skill value are initialized at 0.3.
    Corresponding to these settings, the level of severity is
set at 0.5, defining that any individuals scoring higher than
0.5 in their long-term stress and exhaustion levels will be
considered as experiencing difficulties in coping. These
simulations used the following parameters settings:
tmax=1000 (to represent a monitoring activity up to 42 days),
∆t=0.3, all proportional and flexibility rates are assigned as

several systematic experiments to determine the most
