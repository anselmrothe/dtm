Discussion
Contrary to our predictions, providing multiple exemplars for
number estimation did not improve accuracy. In fact, per-
formance was worse than in Exp. 1, where judgments were
based on the number of repetitions of a single stimulus. This
suggests that performance in Exp. 1 did not asymptote around
5 presentations because of habituation or diminished atten-
tion. The worse performance here could reflect poor encoding

psychophysical effects are evident when two quantities must
be discriminated. The distance effect refers to the relative
ease with which participants can discriminate two quantities
that are farther apart in number space (e.g., 2 vs. 3 compared
to 2 vs. 4). The magnitude effect refers to the fact that a
given numerical distance can become harder to discriminate
at higher magnitudes (e.g., 2 vs. 3 compared to 8 vs. 9). We
explore whether these psychophysical effects also occur when
discriminating numerosities defined by long-term memory.
