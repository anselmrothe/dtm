C3, CZ, C4, T8, P7, P3, PZ, P4, P8, O1, and O2. Bipolar
horizontal EOG was recorded between electrodes at the
outer left and right canthus. Bipolar vertical EOG was
recorded for both eyes. Electrode impedances were kept
below 5 kΩ. EEG and EOG signals were sampled at 1000
Hz, amplified (EEG: 0.2 mV/V; EOG: 0.5 mV/V; time
constant: 10 sec.), and digitally low-pass filtered with a cut-
off frequency of 30 Hz; effective sample frequency was 100
