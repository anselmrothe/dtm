Abstract: In American English, the qualitative vowel contrasts /I/-/E/ and /E/-/ae/ are distinguished primarily by
spectral and duration cues, respectively. Japanese uses duration cues for quantitative, but not qualitative contrasts.
We measured arm movements with a mouse-tracking task while native English and Japanese speakers living in the
United States distinguished spectral and duration contrasts in the word pairs ”pin/pen” and ”pen/pan.” While both
groups identified the words correctly, when distinguishing pan from pen, the English but not Japanese speakers’
mouse-trajectories lean towards ’pen’ earlier in the trial, when the information accumulated to that point is more
consistent with the shorter of the two words. This suggests that while English speakers act rapidly on incoming
acoustic information as it unfolds, Japanese speakers wait for more information before responding. These results may
reflect Japanese speakers’ expertise with duration cues from extensive experience with native quantity contrasts.
