Recently, increasing attention has been drawn to the
importance of a model’s flexibility and complexity in model
evaluation, and the necessity to penalize models that are
more complex (any data pattern can be accounted for
perfectly by a sufficiently complex model). Comparing the
best fit a model can provide ignores this complexity, while
assessing the average fit of the model across all possible
parameter values balances model complexity and data fit
(e.g., Pitt, Kim & Myung, 2003). This average fit is
measured by the marginal likelihood. Given the differences
in functional form of the GCM and IDM, the model
evaluation in terms of marginal likelihoods is preferable.
  The results of the model analyses are reported through             Figure 1. Model weights for the GCM, MPM and IDM for
