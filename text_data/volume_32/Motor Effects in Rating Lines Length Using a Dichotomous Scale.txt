Hypotheses
   In the current experiment, participants’ task was to rate
lines’ lengths using a dichotomous scale (a line could be
rated as “short” or “long”). If the motor actions (hand
movements) required for giving one of the two responses

Method
Participants 64 New Bulgarian University (26 males, 38
females) undergraduate students volunteered for this study.
Stimuli The stimulus material consisted of 36 lines of
different lengths appearing in the middle of a computer
screen. The shortest line was 38 pixels and the longest line
was 668 pixels, with an increment of 18 pixels. Lines were
2 pixels thick.
Apparatus Lines were presented on a 17’’ TFT monitor
with a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels. The responses were
obtained using a standard computer keyboard. The
experimental script was written with the E-Prime 1.1
software.
Design and procedure The experiment was conducted in
small rooms with each participant being tested individually.             Figure 2: The F4 and F9 buttons were used as response
