things into categories. This faculty allows us to classify new
examples and make useful predictions concerning their
properties. Two general classes of models have been
proposed to account for phenomena in concept learning:
prototype and exemplar models. Prototype models claim
that experience with items that belong to a given category
results in the formation of a summary representation of all
the items observed (Posner & Keele, 1968; Reed, 1972).
Subsequent categorization of a new item is then based on a
comparison between the prototype and the new item. Thus,
the more similar a particular instance is to the abstracted
prototype, the more likely it is to be classified as a category
member (Homa & Cultice, 1984; Homa, Sterling, & Trepel,
1981). In contrast, exemplar models claim that all the
observed items are remembered and that the categorization           Figure 1: Hypothetical representations of three concepts. P1,
