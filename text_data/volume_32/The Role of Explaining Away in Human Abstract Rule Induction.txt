The resulting distribution reflects the bias toward small
intervals in typical folk music (Dawson, 2007). The rate of
repetition across the 200 melodies is 39.3% of all intervals
in the LV condition (Fig. 1b), and 26.3% in the HV
condition (Fig. 1c).
   The Repetition conditions control for the actual rate of
repetition, while removing the overall “smoothness”
constraint. Here, the HV and LV conditions (Fig. 1d-e) are
matched to their Smooth counterparts for the number of
repetitions, but unlike in the Smooth cases, the remaining
notes are equiprobable. Here, the high rate of repetition                                          Figure 2: Test Prompt

regularity that accounts for that frequency.
   A secondary question is whether the presence of an
inexplicably high rate of repetitions will encourage learners
to encode discrete “same” and “different” relations at the
expense of the continuous relations among frequencies,
thereby increasing the proportion of attention allocated to
repetition and hence increasing performance in grammar-
learning. If so, the Repetition group should outperform the
Uniform group.

manipulation would observably shift performance. As such,
the particular values of the scores received by these
