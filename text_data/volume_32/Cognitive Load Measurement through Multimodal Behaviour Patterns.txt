Abstract: Our research focuses on extending the accepted benefits of multimodal computer interaction by using
the paradigm to detect fluctuations in cognitive load. The advantage of this approach is that cognitive load can be
determined implicitly by monitoring variations in specific multimodal input features executed during day to day tasks
using a computer interface. Such unobtrusive measures may help determine the userâ€™s cognitive load in real-time,
and achieve the ultimate goal of adapting information selection and presentation in a dynamic computer interface
with reference to load. We identified some correlations between the communicative structure of combined speech and
manual gesture input and high levels of cognitive load. The results suggest that semantic multimodal communicative
structures are sensitive to cognitive load variations, with multimodal communication becoming half as redundant in
high load than in low load. The feasibility of using rates of redundant constructions or complementary constructions
in multimodal input as an index of cognitive load is supported by the results of our study.
