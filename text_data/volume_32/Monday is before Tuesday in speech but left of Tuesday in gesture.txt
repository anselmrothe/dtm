Abstract: Do English speakers gesture about time the same way they talk about it? In spoken English, time
appears to flow along the sagittal (front/back) axis: we look forward to the future and back on the past. Yet, when
English speakers produce spontaneous gestures they often use the lateral axis, gesturing leftward for earlier times
and rightward for later times, consistent with the flow of time on calendars and graphs.
Here we show that speakers spatialize time on the lateral axis overwhelmingly more often than on the sagittal axis
in spontaneous co-speech gestures. This is true despite the prevalence of spoken front/back metaphors and complete
absence of left/right metaphors for time in spoken language. Interestingly, front-back gestures, though rare, were
more common during deictic language, consistent with predictions based on signed languages. We propose possible
pragmatic, kinematic, and mnemonic motivations for this dissociation between spatio-temporal metaphors in speech
and gesture.
