OD problem(s). A third possibility is that the relaxing of
multiple constraints opens up the problem space too much,
thus leading to a difficulty in finding a correct solution path
(c.f. Ohlsson, 1996; Ormerod, MacGregor, & Chronicle,
2002). This third explanation would also lead to the same
pattern of results. Future research should address the
mechanisms that underlie constraint relaxation interactions
and, if possible, attempt to tease apart which of these three
possibilities best explains negative transfer in problem
solving performance.
