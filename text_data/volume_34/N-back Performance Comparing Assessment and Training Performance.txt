   Second, unlike accuracy predictions, RT predictions are
not symmetric around the target position. RTs for lures
closer to the current stimulus should take longer to respond
to correctly than lures further away from the current
stimulus. That is, lures that match the 2-back position
should take longer to reject than lures in the 6-back position.
In contrast, the time it takes to make incorrect responses to
2-back and 6-back lures should not differ. These predictions
are shown in Figure 5b.
   We conducted a new experiment in which all participants
had extensive experience at a moderately high level of n, 4-

participants were able to reach that level, 4-back allowed

showed the same reaction time profile as was shown at
higher levels of n. This pattern was not as consistent at
lower levels of n, specifically 1- and 2-back.
                        Experiment
One hundred and forty-seven participants were randomly
assigned into one of two counterbalanced conditions which
determined if the participants performed sequences with
lures first or second. Seventy-four participants were in the
lure-first condition, seventy-three lure-second. Both
conditions performed 16 sequences with lures and 16
sequences without lures. Each sequence was 25 letters long
and contained five targets and either eight or zero lures.             Figure 3. Participant (a) and Model (b) mean accuracy

Figure 5a. In contrast, target RT was not significantly
different for correct and incorrect responses. Also as in the
training data, participants were quickest to respond to filler
items correctly.
   There was not a significant difference between 6-back and
2-back lures for incorrect responses, but there was for
correct responses. This pattern of results was predicted by
the model. However, there were also some inconsistencies
with the previous data. Inconsistent with both the training
data and the model’s predictions, the present experiment
found incorrect filler responses were faster, not slower, than
the incorrect responses to lures, on average. Also,
participants were quicker to respond to target items than
predicted by the model. Both correct and incorrect target
responses were significantly faster than the average lure
responses.
