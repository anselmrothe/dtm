Measure of perceptual fluency
  We assessed fluency in music reading with a sequential
matching paradigm and used this as an indicator of
individual music reading ability since it is more direct and
objective compared with other measures such as years of
experience and self-rated ability (Wong & Gauthier, 2010).
On each trial, a central fixation was presented for 200 ms,
followed by a 500 ms pre-mask, and a four-note sequence
for a varied duration. After a 500 ms post-mask, two four-
note sequences appeared side-by-side, one identical to the
first sequence, and the other with one of the notes shifted by
one step (with up/down shifts counterbalanced). The task
was to select the matching sequence by key press. The
presentation duration threshold for 80% accuracy was

p = .003. Sheffé tests (p < .05) revealed that d’ at the Center
position was better than the Far Right but no different from
the Far Left. However, d’ was similar between Left and
Right positions, and between Far Left and Far Right
positions. Therefore we could not conclude that the OVP
function for the intermediate readers was biased to either
side of the sequences.
