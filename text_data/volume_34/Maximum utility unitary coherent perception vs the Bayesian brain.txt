Two further training rounds take place. In the first, the lower
half (x + z > 0) of the missile-launching area is ‘blacked out’.
It is coloured red, and the joystick is unable to move into
the red area. In the second round, the situation is reversed

blacked out region is to fire from a position as close to it as
