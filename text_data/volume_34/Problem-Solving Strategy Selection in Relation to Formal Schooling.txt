search based on the previous work of Tulviste et al. (1978).
They have shown that reasoning is a skill that improves
strongly with the level of literacy (Tulviste, Riikliku, &
Toimetised, 1978). Several types of reasoning were consid-
ered for this study. Syllogistic deductive reasoning was se-
lected as studies have shown that it is a skill that comes with
formal schooling and evolves to be used in everyday life on
different types of problems. In addition, the mental proof the-
ory shows that syllogistic deductive reasoning is approached
by solvers using one of the following techniques (Knauff et
al., 2002; Rips, 1994): spatial reasoning, visual reasoning or
reasoning using formal logic, entailing a variety of strategies             Figure 1: Towers of Hanoi strategy selection tree
