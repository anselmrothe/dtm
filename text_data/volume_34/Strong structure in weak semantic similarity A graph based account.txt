In other words, the Medin and Ortony (1989) argument about
shared predicates may only apply between items that are al-
ready highly related. If this is the case, then one might expect
Goodman’s problem to arise when we try to measure weak
similarities, causing each person’s judgment to be essentially
arbitrary and there to be few stable preferences across people.
The other possibility is that there is enough shared structure
in our mental representations that there is a strong agreement
