position appears to rest upon intuitions that are, without
discernible justification, idiosyncratic; psychological
investigations are the proper methodology for determining
how scientists conceive of explanations. In addition, given
that the capacity to produce a certain kind of mental state
(i.e., finding intelligible) seems to be the crucial factor,
empirical investigation into the actual exercise of this
capacity will surely be a part of any complete portrait of
why certain representations are regarded as explanations and
others are not. Indeed, insofar as scientists and laypeople
have, with their concepts of explanation, correctly
demarcated the boundaries of a real natural or sociocultural
kind, then psychological research into what it means to find
a happening intelligible will probably contribute much to
our understanding of what explanations are, in and of
themselves. Thus, for philosophers of science wishing to
know what explanations are and what role they play in our
lay and scholarly lives, it would seem inadvisable to turn
their backs on empirical psychology and retreat to
