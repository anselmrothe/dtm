Participants
Forty-three students participated in this study. The students
came from MGMT 330—Fundamentals of Virtual Business
Programming, and none of them had any experience with
figure drawing or 3D modeling prior to taking the course,
which was a required course for junior and senior level
students majoring in management of information systems.
Apparatus
For hardware, students used their personal laptops or
desktop computers to run the 3-D modeling software. The
software used was Maya 2010, which the students
downloaded for free from the Autodesk.com website as part
of Autodesk’s free software program for students and
faculty. All 43 students reported successfully loading Maya
onto their personal computers. The University’s online
instructional system, WebCT, held a link to YouTube
