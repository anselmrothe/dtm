results of our study can be used as a starting point for
constructing the explicit rules to articulate the native-like
linguistic sense (implicit knowledge).
   For the purpose of our study, only the group of basic color
terms has been employed. We have provided evidence that

likely to be true for such data. However, to prove that this
tendency is general among GAIRAIGO more data on
various loanwords needs to be analyzed. On the other hand,
corpus data represents only a part of the whole scope of
Modern Japanese.
   To improve the quality of analysis it is important to
integrate native speakers’ introspection-based analysis.
Thus, two main directions for further research are increasing
data set and extending methods of analysis.
