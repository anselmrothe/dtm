   In sum, preschoolers actively process adjective information
in production and comprehension as cues for uniquely iden-
tifying referents. But can children apply this knowledge to
make inferences about what implicit information is conveyed
by a speaker’s choice of adjective use? To our knowledge, this
is the first investigation of children’s abilities to use referen-
tial expressions to make inferences about the broader context.
   In this paper, we outline four experiments and a corpus
analysis investigating pragmatic inferences from information
contained in speaker word choice. In Experiment 1, we
used a novel task to examine whether adults use adjective
information to infer referential contrast, and found that they
performed equally strongly with color and size terms. We
