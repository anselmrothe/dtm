time for reading scores. Training, on the other hand,
positively affected this trend, indicating that the formal
language training resulted in faster improvement in ILR
ratings for both listening and reading. While people with
lower initial ratings showed a faster rate of improvement in
listening, this pattern was reversed for reading. It may be
that attaining higher proficiency levels in reading becomes
easier as proficiency increases, while attaining higher levels
for listening becomes more difficult as proficiency
increases. This is a topic for future research.
Loss in ILR ratings To examine how the amount of time
between test occasions affected the incidence of loss in
ratings, event history analyses were conducted separately
for reading and listening. A test history was coded as                  Figure 2. Loss in listening ratings over time

Surprisingly, however, those with higher scores exhibited a
faster rate of loss, with the odds of this group showing loss
projected as roughly 1.99 times higher than the odds for
those with lower initial ratings. This finding is contrary to
what has been found in previous studies (Clark & Jorden,
1984; Gardner et al., 1987; Kaufman, 1995; Nagasawa,
1999), and will be discussed in the Summary below.

                Summary and Conclusion
The findings from the current study are in line with previous
results from studies examining change in foreign language
skills in several ways. Consistent with previous research
investigating the duration of the period of reduced input
(e.g., Murtagh & van der Slik, 2004; Nagasawa, 1999;
Reetz-Kurashige, 1999), the probability of loss increased as
the amount of time since the first test increased for both
reading and listening. These results indicate that, all other
factors being equal (amount of foreign language use,
motivation, etc.), ILR ratings for these individuals will tend
to decrease as the amount of time between test
