JRDs Task After finishing the egocentric pointing tasks,
the blindfolded participants were escorted to another room
to perform JRDs. They were allowed to remove the
blindfold and take a short break before proceeding to the
JRDs. The participants first initiated each trial by pressing a
button of the joystick. Trials began with the imagined
standing location and facing object given aurally (e.g.,
“Imagine you are at the mug facing the ball”). After having
a clear mental image of where he or she was standing and
what he or she was facing, participants pulled the joystick
trigger, and the target object was immediately presented
