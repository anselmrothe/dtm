this idea further.
                       Experiment 2
The results from Experiment 1 suggest that labels attached
to face pictures can modify people’s perception of
similarity. In Experiment 1, all dissimilar face pictures
carried the different labels as the target picture (Figure 1b);
as a result, the difference between the two face pictures
(target and dissimilar base pictures) was exaggerated
considerably. If, as hypothesized, the categorical labels
attached to the face pictures are indeed responsible for the
modified perception faces, then the labels can also create the
perception of “sameness.” In other words, if the dissimilar
face pictures carry the same label as the target picture then
                                                                         Figure 5. The proportion of participants selecting the
