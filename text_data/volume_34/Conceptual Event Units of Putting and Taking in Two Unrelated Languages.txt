Responses to seen and new items were analyzed separately

block order (AB or BA) mixed ANOVAs, with construction
and event type being within-participant factors, and
language and block order between-participant factors. The
dependent variable was the number of reported recognitions.
Block order was not significant for seen (F(1,59) = 0.62, p =
0.43, ηp2 = 0.01) or new items (F(1,59) < 0.01, p = 0.94, ηp2
= 0.01), so we collapsed over this factor.
   We first tested whether participants were able to correctly
recognize the items they had seen. The overall accuracy was

speakers. The difference between language groups was not
