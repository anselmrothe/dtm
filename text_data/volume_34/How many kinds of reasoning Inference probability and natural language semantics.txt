Abstract

lar, Rips and Heit & Rotello argue that non-linearities cannot be accounted for by probabilistic theories of reasoning,
which identify the strength of an argument with the conditional probability of the conclusion given the premises (Heit,
1998; Kemp & Tenenbaum, 2009; Oaksford & Chater, 2007;
Tenenbaum, Griffiths, & Kemp, 2006). On the other hand,
they claim that the results are consistent with two-process theories of reasoning (Evans & Over, 1996).
We argue that the manipulation involving “necessary” and
“plausible” hinges not on a qualitative distinction between
two reasoning processes, but rather on facts about the semantics of these words which can be modeled using a single
underlying scale of argument strength—conditional probability. We propose a semantically motivated model of reasoning
with epistemic concepts which predicts non-linear response
patterns depending on the choice of modal similar to those
observed in previous work, and makes detailed quantitative
predictions about response patterns in invalid arguments.
We test the claim that the modal word is the crucial factor
using a new paradigm that isolates its effects. Our arguments
had the same form as the examples above, except that we
placed the modal word of interest in the conclusion:

Previous research (Heit & Rotello, 2010; Rips, 2001; Rotello
& Heit, 2009) has suggested that differences between inductive
and deductive reasoning cannot be explained by probabilistic
theories, and instead support two-process accounts of reasoning. We provide a probabilistic model that predicts the observed non-linearities and makes quantitative predictions about
responses as a function of argument strength. Predictions were
tested using a novel experimental paradigm that elicits the
previously-reported response patterns with a minimal manipulation, changing only one word between conditions. We also
found a good fit with quantitative model predictions, indicating
that a probabilistic theory of reasoning can account in a clear
and parsimonious way for qualitative and quantitative data previously argued to falsify them. We also relate our model to
recent work in linguistics, arguing that careful attention to the
semantics of language used to pose reasoning problems will
sharpen the questions asked in the psychology of reasoning.
Keywords: Reasoning, induction, deduction, probabilistic
model, formal semantics.

Suppose that you have learned a new biological fact about
mammals: whales and dogs both use enzyme B-32 to digest
their food. Is it now necessary that horses do the same? Is
it plausible, possible, or more likely than not? Expressions
of this type—known as epistemic modals in linguistics—
have played a crucial role in recent work that argues for a
sharp qualitative distinction between inductive and deductive
modes of reasoning. In the paradigm introduced by Rips
(2001) and extended by Heit and Rotello (2010); Rotello and
Heit (2009), participants are divided into two conditions and
are either asked to judge whether a conclusion is “necessary”
assuming that some premises are true, or whether it is “plausible”. The former is identified with the deductive mode of
reasoning, and the latter with the inductive mode.
These authors asked participants in both conditions to evaluate a variety of logically valid and logically invalid arguments. An example invalid argument might be “Cows
have sesamoid bones; Mice have sesamoid bones; therefore,
Horses have sesamoid bones”. An example valid argument
might be “Mammals have sesamoid bones; therefore, horses
have sesamoid bones.” They found that there was a non-linear
relationship between the endorsement rates of arguments depending on condition: participants in both conditions generally endorsed logically valid arguments, but participants in
the deductive condition were much less likely to endorse invalid arguments than those in the inductive condition. These
results are interpreted as a challenge to theories of reasoning which rely on a single dimension of argument strength
and interpret deductive validity as simply the upper extreme
of this dimension(Harman, 1999; Johnson-Laird, 1994; Osherson, Smith, Wilkie, Lopez, & Shafir, 1990). In particu-

Premise 1: Cows have sesamoid bones.
Premise 2: Mice have sesamoid bones.
Conclusion: It is {plausible/necessary/possible/likely/
probable/certain} that horses have sesamoid bones.
We will refer to configurations such as “It is plausible/possible/etc. that C” as a modal frame. If varying the
modal frame gives rise to a non-linear pattern of responses
similar to the one found in previous work, this would indicate
that an explanation of these results should be framed in terms
of the meaning of these modal words.
Together, the model and experimental evidence indicate
that the negative conclusions of previous work regarding onedimensional theories of argument strength are not warranted:
it is possible to explain non-linear response patterns with a
probabilistic account of argument strength.

Previous Work
Rips (2001) conducted a reasoning experiment designed to
investigate the traditional distinction between deductive and
inductive reasoning. Participants in two groups were asked
to judge arguments either according to whether the conclusion was necessary (assuming that the premises were true) or
whether it was plausible. Most participants in both conditions
accepted logically valid arguments and rejected invalid arguments whose conclusion was not causally consistent with the

665

A Probabilistic Model

premises, such as “Car X strikes a wall, so Car X speeds up”.
However, participants differed by condition in whether they
rejected non-valid arguments which were causally consistent
with the premises: those in the inductive condition generally
accepted arguments such as “Car X strikes a wall, so Car X
slows down”, while those in the deductive condition did not.
Rips argued that this result falsifies theories of reasoning in
which argument strength is a one-dimensional quantity such
as conditional probability: “[i]f participants base all forms of
argument evaluation on the position of the argument on a single psychological dimension, then induction and deduction
judgments should increase or decrease together” (p.133).1
Heit and Rotello (2010); Rotello and Heit (2009) extended
Rips’ paradigm in a number of ways. Their core finding was
that d ′ , a standard measure of sensitivity in Signal Detection
Theory (SDT), was significantly higher in the deductive condition across a variety of arguments types and manipulations.
d ′ is defined as z(H) − z(F), the difference between the zscored hit rate H and false alarm rate F (Macmillan & Creelman, 2005). This difference means that participants in the
inductive condition were more sensitive to argument validity
than participants in the deductive condition (see Table 1).

In contrast to Rips and Rotello & Heit, we do not see these
results as strong support for a two-process theory. Instead,
we will argue that these results are also compatible with a
probabilistic account of inductive reasoning once the semantics of the modal words used in the experiment is taken into
account. In this section we propose a model of the relationship between the probability on the one hand and epistemic
concepts such as certainty, necessity, and plausibility on the
other. The latter are treated as non-linear functions of the former determined by a single parameter per item. This model,
inspired by recent work in formal semantics, predicts nonlinear response patterns and variation in d ′ depending on the
modal used, and makes a number of fine-grained predictions
that we will later evaluate against the results of an experiment.
Our probabilistic model of reasoning with epistemic
modals is intended to capture the following intuitions. A
maximally strong conclusion C remains maximally strong
whether you ask if it is possible, plausible, likely or necessary; a maximally weak conclusion remains maximally weak
under the same conditions; but there is much more flexibility around the middle of the probability scale depending on
which question is asked. If C has a probability of .4, it presumably will count as possible and perhaps as plausible, but
it would not seem to be likely and surely not necessary or
certain. Thus the effect of an epistemic modal on a conditional probability should be a transformation that preserves
the minimum value 0 and the maximum value 1.
Perhaps the simplest way to capture the behavior just described is to suppose that each modal M ∈ {possible, plausible, likely, probable, certain, necessary} is associated with
a parameter αM ∈ R+ which, in combination with the conditional probability pr(C∣P) of conclusion C given premises P,
determines the probability of It is M that C given P. We propose that αM relates these two probabilities by a power-law:

Differential sensitivity indicates that the difference between conditions is not simply a shift in response criterion
in the presence of two equal-variance Gaussians representing
signal and noise. Thus we cannot fit a one-dimensional SDT
model to such results. In accord with Rips, Rotello and Heit
(2009) argue that the non-linear relationship between validity and condition is a challenge to probabilistic theories of
reasoning. They argue that the results are better captured
by a two-dimensional SDT model with possibly orthogonal
dimensions of inductive strength and deductive validity, in
which the response criterion can vary in two dimensions.2

pr(It is M that C∣P) = pr(C∣P)αM

(1)

We model arguments with no modal as also being governed
by some some αM as in (1) (rather than directly reflecting the
conditional probability of the conclusion given the premises).
We assume that participants’ responses to a modalized
question Q are governed by (1) plus a noise parameter ε
(interpreted as the proportion of trials in which participants
choose a response at random).
ε
pr(“yes”∣P,Q = Is it M that C?) = pr(C∣P)αM (1 − ε) + (2)
2
Depending on αM we get a variety of possible curves, a few of
which are sketched in figure 1b (setting ε = .1 for illustrative
purposes). This model captures the behavior just described:
in the limits αM does not influence the response probability,
but there is significant variation in response probabilities in
the middle range depending on αM . This feature leads to a
prediction that that the choice of modal will have less influence on response rates for arguments with very high strength
(e.g., valid arguments) than those with intermediate strength.

1
Rips (2001) also found a crossover effect in which participants
in the “necessary” condition were slightly more likely to endorse
valid arguments that were inconsistent with causal knowledge than
participants in the “plausible” condition, but the reverse was true
for arguments consistent with causal knowledge. Heit & Rotello’s
work did not find any analogous effect, nor did we in our experiment reported below, and we do not consider it further. However, it
is possible that the effect is real and attributable to one of the various detailed differences in materials and instructions between the
experiments.
2
Heit and Rotello (2010); Rotello and Heit (2009) also introduced a number of further manipulations involving e.g. constrained
response time, number of premises, and readability which we will
not discuss in detail for reasons of space. See the concluding section
for a brief consideration of two of these manipulations, however.

Figure 1: (a): Predicted response probability for various settings of αM . (b): Example of relation between αM and d ′ .
We also predict that d ′ will vary depending on αM . Suppose for illustration that the mean conditional probability of
logically invalid arguments in some sample is .5, and that the
conditional probability of valid arguments is 1. The d ′ statistic estimated from this data should then be (on average)
d′

= z(1αM (1 − ε) + ε/2) − z(.5αM (1 − ε) + ε/2)
= z(1 − ε/2) − z(.5αM (1 − ε) + ε/2)

Non-valid:
Cows have enzyme X.
Seals have enzyme X.
So, it is M that horses
have enzyme X.

This minimal manipulation allowed us to isolate the effect of
the modal frame on acceptance rates both for valid vs. invalid
arguments and for invalid arguments of varying strengths. We
also used a larger set of epistemic modal expressions than
were used in previous work, including possible, plausible,
likely, probable, necessary, and certain.

(3)

If ε = .1, we expect the observed d ′ to be related to αM as
in figure 1b. This illustrates the fact that the value of the d ′
statistic is not predicted to be constant in our probabilistic
model, but should depend on the choice of M. Thus, a model
with one dimension of argument strength (conditional probability) is able to predict non-linearities of the type previously
claimed to be problematic for probabilistic accounts.
The model also makes strong quantitative predictions about
the relationship between different modal frames. That is, we
predict a systematic (though non-linear) relationship between
the response rates to the same argument in the modal frames
It is M1 that C and It is M2 that C. If M1 is associated with parameter α1 and M2 with α2 , for any argument with premises
P and conclusion C there is some positive r such that
pr(Is it M1 that C∣P)

= pr(C∣P)αM1
= pr(C∣P)(r×αM2 )
= pr(Is it M2 that C∣P)r

Valid:
Horses have enzyme X.
Cows have enzyme X.
So, it is M that horses
have enzyme X.

Methods
Participants 507 participants were recruited using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform, with a restriction to participants located in the United States. They were compensated
for their participation.
Materials Participants saw 21 valid and invalid arguments
with two premises and a conclusion. 18 of these included one
of the 6 modal words listed above (3 for each modal), and
3 did not include a modal word. The properties used in the
arguments were chosen from a list of unfamiliar biological
and pseudo-biological properties. In every case, the animal
in the conclusion was “horses” (Osherson et al., 1990). The
arguments seen were randomly selected from a total of 63 arguments tested. 36 were non-valid arguments, in which the
premise animals were chosen from the set {cows, chimps, gorillas, mice, squirrels, elephants, seals, rhinos, dolphins}. 27
were logically valid arguments with one of two forms, following (Rotello & Heit, 2009): one premise involved a mammal
and the other was an identity premise (stating that horses have
the property) or an inclusion premise (stating that mammals
or animals have the property).
Procedure Participants were instructed to answer each
question according to whether they agreed with the conclusion, assuming that the premises were true. For each question
participants were asked to select “agree” or “disagree” and to
give a confidence rating on a five-point scale.

(4)

The prediction that every pair of modals should be related by
a power-law allows us to evaluate model fit using a variety of
arguments which, although not logically valid, vary widely in
intuitive strength. It also shows that our model predicts that
the strength of any two arguments should be related monotonically (though non-linearly) across modal frames.

Experiment
Our experiment tested the hypothesis that non-linear response
patterns can be attributed to the semantics of the modal expressions used. The main innovation was to manipulate the
choice of modal M within the stimulus sentence:

Results

ference previously reported can be elicited by a difference of
a single modal word, and so appears to be triggered by semantic properties of the modal words.
Assessing Model Fit As pointed out in introducing the
model, our account predicts three general trends. First, it
predicts that acceptance rates should vary less across valid
arguments than across invalid arguments (Figure 1a). This
is indeed what we find (Figure 2a). Second, it predicts the
possibility of a continuous gradient in d ′ values (Figure 1b).
Our results confirm this prediction as well (Figure 2b). Third,
it predicts that the acceptance rate of argument A in any two
modal frames M1 and M2 should be related by a power-law.
This is the quantitative prediction that we now set out to test.

We analyzed data from the 485 participants who reported that
their native language was English, for 10,185 total judgments.
No systematic differences emerged between identity and inclusion arguments, and we group them together as valid.
Our results replicated the crucial finding of (Heit &
Rotello, 2010; Rotello & Heit, 2009) showing that sensitivity
to argument validity is greater when participants are asked to
judge whether a conclusion is “necessary” than when they are
asked whether it is “plausible” (Table 2). The difference in d ′
values is significant at the p < .05 level.

and necessary only), with 95% confidence intervals.

We fit the model to our results using the acceptance rates of
each argument in the no-modal condition as a baseline. Note
that we do not believe that acceptance rates in this condition
are an estimate of the true probability of the conclusion given
the premises. However, our model predicts that the choice of
baseline condition should not affect predictions (cf. equation
4). In accord with this prediction we found no systematic effect on R2 by varying the choice of baseline. The primary
effect of the choice of baseline condition, then, is that estimates of αM given for the other conditions are up to multiplication by α0 , the parameter which determines the probability
of arguments in the baseline condition.

Comparing Table 1 with Table 2, there are two clear differences between our results and those of Rotello and Heit
(2009): our participants rejected valid arguments with necessary more often than with plausible, and they accepted invalid
arguments at much higher rates. These factors contributed to
lower d ′ in both conditions. The first difference suggests that
participants in our experiment judged some logically valid arguments as strong but not maximally strong. The second is
plausibly due to the use of different materials in our experiment: Rotello & Heit used the same predicate “have property
X” in all arguments, using the variable X in the stimuli and instructing participants to treat property X as a novel biological
property. The use of more natural biological predicates in our
experiment may have encouraged participants to have greater
confidence in their guesses, particularly if they had general
background knowledge about e.g. enzymes and bones.
The fact that d ′ differed significantly for “necessary” and
“plausible” suggests that our within-participants manipulation successfully captured the core features of betweenparticipants manipulations in previous work. That is, the dif-

Figure 3 plots the endorsement rate of each argument in
the unmodalized condition against the endorsement rate for
the same argument in various modal frames. We calculated
the best-fit αM for each condition. For each graph in Figure
3 the curve determined by equation (2) is superimposed, with
the overall best-fit noise parameter ε = .12. As the R2 values
in Figure 3 and Table 2 show, this model captures much of
the variance in the data, but not all of it.
In order to discern whether the remaining variance was
due to systematic factors that our model does not capture,
we performed a split-half reliability test, randomly dividing
the data into equal-sized halves 10,000 times and testing the
correlation between the two halves on the same measure that

was used to fit our model: acceptance rate by argument and
modal. The model correlations were overall very close to the
split-half correlations (Table 3). This suggests that the model
captures most of the true structure in the data, though a good
deal of noise remains that we cannot expect to explain.
Recall that the model predicts a consistent order in the endorsement rates of arguments across modal frames (see equation 4). In order to test this prediction we considered two
tests, a permutation test and a model-based simulation. The
average value of Spearman’s rank-order correlation for all
pairwise comparisons between modal frames in our experiment was .53. A 10,000-sample permutation test revealed
that this correlation was highly significant, p < .0001.
For the model-based test, we simulated 1,000 data sets
with the same dimensions as our data using the best-fit model
predictions as binomial proportions for each argument and
modal frame. Equation 4 entails that all rank-order correlation in the model predictions are 1, and so this test gives us an
opportunity to observe what correlations we should expect to
see in a data set of this size if the prediction of a perfect underlying rank-order correlation is correct. The result was consistent with the observed rank-order correlation of .53, with
95% of the model-generated correlations falling between .49
and .64 (mean = .57). This result suggests that the model’s

Relation to Formal Semantics
Epistemic modality has been the subject of much investigation in formal semantics (Kratzer, 1991; Egan & Weatherson,
2011). This paper has been concerned with a subtype of epistemic modals whose grammatical features indicate that they
are gradable adjectives. This means that, like other gradable
adjectives, they can be used in comparative and degree modification structures: for example, conclusion C might be more
plausible than C′ given some evidence, or C might be very
likely or almost necessary. This corresponds to the fact that
person x can be taller than person y, and a glass of water
might be very large or almost full. Gradable expressions are
generally treated in formal semantics as functions which map
objects to points on a scale and compare them to threshold
values (Kennedy, 2007). Recent empirical and formal work
on gradable epistemic modals suggests that a scalar analysis
is appropriate for them as well, and that probability is a good
choice for the underlying scale (Lassiter, 2010; Yalcin, 2010).
Although our model is superficially different from linguistic models, there is in fact a straightforward translation between the two. Linguistic models assume that the location of
the threshold is typically uncertain, a fact which is closely related to the problem of vagueness. If the uncertain location of
the threshold for gradable expressions is modeled probabilistically as in (Frazee & Beaver, 2010; Lassiter, 2011; Schmidt,
Goodman, Barner, & Tenenbaum, 2009), our model can be
seen as describing the cumulative distribution of this threshold. Letting pM (θ) be the probability density of the unknown
threshold associated with modal M, the cumulative distribu-

conclusion in these sampled worlds. If people take several
samples and respond “yes” when the conclusion is true in
each sampled world, we recover a power law. If the average number of samples depends on the modal, we recover
the probabilistic model described above. For instance, we
would posit that people tend to take more samples to evaluate
“necessary” conclusions than “plausible” conclusions. This
process-level implementation predicts that under time pressure, when people can take fewer samples, “necessary” would
begin to look more like “plausible”. Indeed, this is exactly the
finding of Heit and Rotello (2010).
We have illustrated an approach to reasoning based on an
overall probabilistic view of inference, together with careful
attention to natural language semantics. We believe that this
approach will prove fruitful in studying a wide variety of phenomena related to human reasoning.

Conclusion

Acknowledgements

We have shown that non-linearities in responses to valid and
invalid arguments can be explained by a simple probabilistic
model, and thus are not evidence against a probabilistic account of reasoning. Our experimental manipulation involved
the difference of a single word (an epistemic modal), and uncovered a gradation of non-linearities as a function of the specific modal used. Our model predicts a particular functional
form for these differences, a power law in conditional probability, which we found in our data. This shows that it is
possible to account for different patterns of results in reasoning experiments without assuming that everyday reasoning
makes use of two (or more) qualitatively different types of
reasoning. Rather, our model utilizes a single type of reasoning — probabilistic inference — together with a number of
different but related linguistic mechanisms for talking about
the results of inferential processes. This indicates that a onedimensional theory of argument strength, coupled with an explicit formal semantics for epistemic modals, can account for
a variety of patterns of reasoning in a parsimonious and explanatory way. This does not rule out a qualitative distinction
between inductive and deductive reasoning, but it does call
into question previous efforts to show that such a distinction
is necessary to account for everyday human reasoning, suggesting instead that a single process may underlie both.
The probabilistic approach also suggests accounts of several related phenomena. For instance, the fact that argument
length tends to affect plausibility judgments more than necessity judgments (Rotello & Heit, 2009) may be attributable to
the fact that, in a probabilistic theory, we expect that adding
premises of the type used in these experiments will usually
increase the probability of the conclusion given the premises
(Heit, 1998). The non-linearities predicted by equation 2 lead
us to expect that the same change in probability will have different effects depending on the modal used.
Our probabilistic theory leaves open the psychological process by which people evaluate arguments. One possibility is
that people are only able to sample possible worlds in accord
with the distribution implied by the premises (Vul, Goodman,
Griffiths, & Tenenbaum, 2009), and evaluate the truth of the
