Material Two categories used in Rehder (2003a) were
translated into German: Kehoe Ants (a biological kind) and
Mya Stars (a non-living natural kind).2 Each category pos-
sessed four binary features. Depending on condition, each
feature had a typical value (coded throughout this paper as
“1”) and an atypical value (coded as “0”). For example,
Kehoe Ants have an immune system that was either hyper-
active or working normal. Which of the two values was
described as typical depended on the experimental condition
(e.g., in the typical condition, it was stated: “Typically,
Kehoe Ants have an immune system that is hyperactive. A
few have a normal immune system.”, in the atypical condi-
tion, it was stated: “Typically, Kehoe Ants have a normal
immune system. A few have an immune system that is hy-
peractive.”).
   Additionally, the features were causally linked in a com-
mon-cause network. Each causal relationship was described
as one feature causing another in the same way Rehder               Figure 3. Results of the replication of the experiment of
