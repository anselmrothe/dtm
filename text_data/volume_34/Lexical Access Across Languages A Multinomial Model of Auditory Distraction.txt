the auditory distracters were taken from the same category

animals, and no “shape” exemplars were presented). On the
remaining trials, the distracter items were taken from one
category of the pair (e.g., fruit) and targets from the other
category (e.g., carpenter’s tools). Additionally, half of the
distracters were presented in English, and half in Welsh,

  In addition to looking at the effects of bilingualism upon
auditory distraction when the distracters are presented in
different languages, it is also of interest to compare the
effects of distracters within a single language. Using the
model to investigate the effects of shifting the language of
distracters has revealed that the language of the distracter is
irrelevant provided it is a known language (Figures 2-4) and
