would then occur before the white circle response signal
appeared on screen. Reaction time was measured from this
stimulus’ appearance on screen until a key press was
detected. A 250ms response-stimulus interval (RSI) then
followed before the appearance of the next colored square
stimulus during which the screen was blank except for the
square and circle outlines. On each trial the stimuli
remained on the screen until the participant had responded
or was timed-out for not having pressed a key within 4.25s.
   If participants pressed an incorrect key or were timed-out
then the trial terminated and the computer issued a short
‘beep’ sound. Following each block, participants rested
during a 30 second break in which they were shown their
average reaction time (in milliseconds) and their accuracy
(as a percentage) for the block of stimuli just completed.
They were also informed whether these scores were better
or worse than those from the previous block. At the end of
the 20th block, participants were instructed to fetch the          Figure 1. Average RT in msecs for different Stimulus

   A short verbal interview asking general questions about
the task was given, and participants were then assessed to
determine the extent of their knowledge about the
contingencies during the experiment. They were first asked
to describe any relationship that they had noticed between
the colors and the circle fills. Then a prediction task was
conducted that closely followed the procedures employed in
the main task they had just experienced. Thus, participants
were instructed to attend to a colored square at fixation in
the middle of two outline circles, but now had to make a
prediction about which circle they thought would fill by
pressing the appropriate key. They were told that the circles
would not fill, and that no response would be considered an
error, apart from pressing keys other than the two response
keys, and that there was no time limit on making their
choice. The prediction task was presented as two short
blocks of 16 trials per block, with each color from both
control and experimental blocks occurring twice in each            Figure 2. Proportion of errors for different Stimulus Types.

responded to more slowly than Control stimuli from the
Control block. We suspect that this is due to the presence of
the Consistent and Inconsistent stimuli in the Experimental
Block. It is not that more errors are being made (overall) in
the Experimental blocks, instead, it may be that the conflict
that occurs on inconsistent trials engages mechanisms that
produce more cautious responding, though we note that this
cannot simply be a speed-accuracy trade-off as the error rate
is, if anything, lower for the Control block stimuli than for
Control stimuli from the Experimental Blocks.
