Abstract
This study examined sex differences in the discrimination of
minimal pairs of foreign language (non-native) tonemes.
Adult native speakers of English (237 women and 177 men),
with no prior exposure to a tonal language, performed an AXtask, which required them to discriminate between rising and
falling-rising Norwegian tonemes. When controlling for
nonverbal intelligence, prior exposure to foreign languages,
and age, sensitivity measures (A’) showed a clear male
advantage. Thus, the sex differences previously observed in
non-linguistic temporal processing tasks appear to extend to
the discrimination of unfamiliar non-native speech sounds.
These sex differences in auditory processing may be due to
anatomical differences between men and women in the ratio
of white to grey matter in the left hemisphere, which, in turn,
might affect speed of neural transmission. These findings
contribute to the ongoing debate on cognitive effects of
putative sex differences in intra- and inter-hemispheric
connectivity.
Keywords: non-native speech perception; tonal contrast; sex
differences; adult L2 learning; auditory processing.

Introduction
Auditory processing of temporal sequences underlies the
neural representation of speech and has been implicated in
impairments in language development; e.g., dyslexia and
Specific Language Impairment (Goswami et al., 2002;
Talcott et al., 2000; Tallal, 1980). However, little is known
about individual differences in auditory processing in the
non-clinical adult population, and, specifically, individual
differences in the ability of adults to discriminate the speech
sounds of foreign (non-native) languages. Illuminating the
basis of individual differences in non-native speech
processing may help to explain some of the considerable
variance in outcomes observed among adult foreign
language (L2) learners (Johnson & Newport, 1989). So far,
only a few studies have explored individual differences in
the processing of non-native speech sounds (Bradlow,
Pisoni, Akahane-Yamada, & Tohkura, 1997; Golestani &
Zatorre, 2009). Thus, we know very little about which
factors, besides age of first exposure (Flege, MacKay &
Meador, 1999), make an adult more or less successful in
processing non-native speech sounds.

Research on temporal processing as a predictor of
psychometric intelligence (Rammsayer & Brandler, 2007)
and working memory capacity (Troche & Rammsayer,
2009) has revealed a sex difference, with men
outperforming women in temporal order judgments (Szelag
et al., 2011; Wittman & Szelag, 2003) and temporal
discrimination tasks (Rammsayer & Troche, 2010). Factoranalytical approaches have traced the male advantage to a
latent variable – temporal resolution power, which has been
linked to neural oscillation rate determining speed and
accuracy of neural transmission (Jensen, 1982). The male
advantage is not confined to the auditory modality,
however, but has also been observed for tactile temporal
processing (Rostad, Mayer, Fung & Brown, 2007),
suggesting that it affects general temporal processing in the
sub-second range.
In addition to sex differences in pure temporal
information processing tasks, there is evidence for a male
advantage in the discrimination of pitch contours of
computer-generated waveforms, comprising a fundamental
frequency and two formants, which were presented
binaurally (McRoberts & Sanders, 1992). Pitch contour
discrimination requires sensitivity to changes in pitch over
time and therefore relies on temporal processing. Rapidly
changing values of one or several acoustic parameters (e.g.,
formant transitions) play a crucial role in distinguishing
different speech sounds—for example, notoriously difficult
phonological contrasts like the dental-retroflex contrast (for
English speakers) or the r/l contrast (for Japanese speakers)
require sensitivity to rapid spectral changes. The present
study therefore aims to examine whether a male advantage
can also be found in the ability to discriminate natural nonnative speech contrasts. Natural speech sounds differ from
synthetic stimuli in their greater variability within speech
sound categories and in the complexity of their acoustic
characteristics.
We chose to examine sensitivity to lexical tones as one
example of such a non-native speech contrast. We used
Norwegian tonemes as many dialects of Norwegian have a
simple tonal system with pitch accents that distinguish
otherwise homophonous bisyllabic words. Detecting these
tonal contrasts requires tracking temporal changes in pitch

1774

contours of bi-syllabic words. We tested adult native
English speakers’ sensitivity to the tonal contrast between
rising and falling-rising tonemes, which are illustrated in
Figure 1.
If sex differences in non-linguistic temporal processing
extend to linguistic stimuli we would expect to see a male
advantage in the processing of an unfamiliar Norwegian
tonal contrast by native English speakers.

processing speed and temporal processing on the one hand
and psychometric intelligence on the other hand (e.g., van
Raavenzwaaj, Brown & Wagenmakers, 2011; Rammsayer
& Brandler, 2007; Sheppard & Vernon, 2008). It is also
important to make sure that any observed differences cannot
be accounted for by prior exposure to tonal contrasts.
Participants: A total of 458 participants (197 men) were
tested in various locations in the United Kingdom and in the
United States (New York City). Participants’ mean age was
22.8 years (range 17-61 years). Of the participants, 282 (117
men) were native speakers of American English and 176 (80
men) were native speakers of Scottish English.
An additional ten native speakers of Norwegian (four
men), aged 20 to 22 years, were tested to confirm that the
chosen tonal contrast can reliably be discriminated by native
speakers of the language.
Materials: To capture the within-category variability
characteristic of natural speech sounds, a male native
speaker of Norwegian recorded two different instances of
each of 16 bisyllabic Norwegian words comprising 8
minimal tonal contrast pairs. In half of the pairs, the first
stressed syllables contained short vowels (mean length 80
ms); in the other half they contained long vowels (mean
length 144 ms). These eight minimal pairs are listed in
Table 1. Stimuli were recorded at a sampling rate of 44.1
kHz and presented to participants through Sennheiser
headphones.

discrimination. Note that the members of a pair are
homophones despite differences in spelling.

Method
We pooled data from six experiments on non-native
discrimination of Norwegian tonal contrasts that were
conducted over a period of five years (Kempe, Thoresen &
Brooks, 2007, 2008; Kempe, Brooks, Marronaro &
Thoresen, 2010; Kempe, Thoresen, Kirk, Brooks &
Schaeffler, 2011). These experiments tested native speakers
of English differing in dialectal background (American,
English and Scottish), and varied with respect to other
cognitive abilities tested (e.g., verbal working memory
capacity) and other speech sound contrasts presented in
addition to the tonal contrast. All six experiments controlled
for nonverbal intelligence and prior exposure to other
languages. It is necessary to control for nonverbal
intelligence because of the well-established link between

To establish whether pitch contours were indeed
sufficiently distinct between the two tonemes, we measured
pitch of the steady-state part of the vowels in the first and
second syllable. As Figure 1 indicates, there should be a
larger difference between pitch on the first and the second
syllable for a rising pitch contour than for a falling-rising
pitch contour. Pitch measurements confirmed that the
median pitch difference between syllables for the rising
pitch contour (38 Hz) was significantly larger than the
median pitch difference for the falling-rising pitch contour
(4 Hz), Mann-Whitney U = 2.0, p < .001, r =.84, indicating

a sufficiently large measurable difference in acoustic
characteristics between the two tonemes.

the various measurements for men and women. The last
column shows the results of a t-test (** indicates
significance after Bonferroni correction at p < .01).

Procedure: The Norwegian tonal contrasts were presented
in an AX discrimination procedure requiring participants to
make judgments about whether pairs of words sounded the
‘same’ or ‘different’. The 32 ‘same’ trials consisted of
different instances of the same word spoken with the same
pitch accent. The 32 ‘different’ trials consisted of minimal
pairs of words spoken with different pitch accents. The two
words in each pair were presented with an inter-stimulus
interval of 200 ms.
Participants also completed the Cattell Culture-Fair Test
of Nonverbal Intelligence, Scale 3, Form A (Cattell &
Cattell, 1973), and a language background questionnaire,
used to confirm participant status as a native English
speaker and to inquire about prior exposure to languages
other than English. Participants were asked to rate their
reading, writing, speaking and comprehension abilities in
each of their languages on a scale from 1 (rudimentary) to 6
(native-like).

To account for potential uncontrolled effects of the
different testing conditions and contexts in the six
experiments, we computed standardized A’ scores for each
experiment separately. These standardized A’ scores served
as the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis
with age, Culture Fair nonverbal intelligence test scores, the
various language background variables, and sex (coded as a
dummy variable) as predictors (see Table 3).

Results
Norwegian

speakers:
Each
participant’s
performance was converted to an A’ score, a measure of
sensitivity that corrects for individual differences in bias. A’
is a non-parametric analogue to d’ and has values ranging
from 0 and 1, with 0.5 corresponding to chance. The mean
A’ score for the native speakers of Norwegian was .93 (SD =
0.04), which supports the validity of our stimuli and
confirms that discrimination of the native tonal contrast did
not pose any problems for native speakers.
English native speakers: Seventeen men and 18 women
reported some familiarity with a tonal language (e.g.,
Chinese). A further three men and six women failed to
provide proficiency ratings in the language background
questionnaire. All these participants were excluded from the
analyses leaving a total of 177 men and 237 women.
The mean A’ score for the entire sample was 0.71 (SD =
0.14). Table 2 presents means and standard deviations for
men and women, along with results of Bonferroni-corrected
t-tests comparing men and women on age, Culture Fair nonverbal intelligence test scores (CF IQ), number of learned
foreign languages (L2s), and mean proficiency self-ratings
for first and second L2s. If participants had not studied any
L2, the corresponding rating scores were set to 0. These
comparisons showed that while women had higher
proficiency self-ratings in their first L2, women’s
discrimination of Norwegian tonemes was significantly
lower than men’s.

The model accounted for a total of 5.8% of the variance,
F(6,405) = 5.2, p < .001, and showed men outperforming
women, over and above a facilitative effect of non-verbal
intelligence. A further stepwise regression analysis with all
predictors entered at the first step, and sex entered at the
second step, showed that sex accounted for a unique 2% of
variance, cumulative F(1,405) = 9.7, p < .01.
To check whether the effect of non-verbal intelligence
was present in both sexes, we performed separate multiple
regression analyses for men and women. In both analyses,
the only significant effect was that of the Culture Fair test
(men: β = .16, p < .05; women: β = .17, p < .05). The
relationship between non-verbal intelligence and sensitivity
to non-native tonal contrasts in men and women is depicted
in Figure 2.

Discussion
Our findings demonstrate a small but significant male
advantage in non-native toneme discrimination, which
cannot be attributed to sex differences in prior exposure to
foreign languages or non-verbal intelligence. The lack of a
link between prior language exposure and processing of
non-native speech sounds is consistent with similar findings
from other studies (Golestani & Zatorre, 2009). Note that
the effect of non-verbal intelligence on toneme
discrimination ability was independent of the effect of sex,
confirming the general link between temporal information
processing—which is one component of non-native speech
sound discrimination—and psychometric intelligence.
The sex effect may seem unexpected because studies that
employ non-native speech sound discrimination tasks or
temporal auditory processing tasks typically do not compare
the performance of men and women. Moreover, given that
the sex effect is very small, the sample sizes in such studies
are often not large enough for it to be detectable. However,
recently, Bowles, Silbert, Jackson & Doughy (2011)
reported a male advantage for discrimination of two Hindi
consonant contrasts involving differences in Voice Onset
Time in a large sample of 1,185 male and 395 female native
speakers of American English. This suggests that the male
advantage in temporal information processing clearly
extends to the processing of difficult non-native speech
sounds containing rapid spectral changes.
What mechanisms may be responsible for this sex effect?
Golestani et al. (2007) have shown in a perceptual training
study that faster learning of non-native speech sounds,
involving rapid spectral changes, was associated with
differences in brain anatomy. Specifically, faster learning
was linked to larger overall white matter volumes in left
Heschl’s gyrus and increased degree of left > right
asymmetry in white matter density in auditory cortex.

Increased white matter volume may indicate greater
myelination, which would result in more rapid neural
transmission crucial for perception of rapid spectral
changes. It may also be due to a greater number of white
matter fibers connecting language regions within and
between cortical hemispheres, for example, connecting the
auditory cortex with anterior and posterior language regions.
Given that for these perceptual learning tasks performance
at the outset was highly correlated with speed of learning
(Golestani & Zatorre, 2009) it is reasonable to speculate that
similar anatomical changes may also distinguish individuals
who perform better in perceptual discrimination tasks when
presented with a non-native speech sound for the first time.
In addition, white matter volume has been shown to be
negatively correlated with variability in isochronous tapping
in the sub-second range (Ullén, Forsman, Blom, Karabanov
& Madison, 2008) suggesting that white matter volume can
be implicated in rapid temporal processing in other domains
as well.
Comparisons of male and female brain anatomy and
cytoarchitecture have revealed larger white matter to grey
matter ratios in men than women, and less white matter
asymmetry between hemispheres in women (Gur et al.,
1999). Gur et al. (1999) suggested that maintaining grey
matter volume consisting of somatodendritic tissue—
responsible for computation—at the relative expense of
myelinated connective tissue—responsible for information
transmission—may be a reasonable evolutionary strategy
for dealing with the smaller cranial volumes of females,
where transmission occurs over relatively shorter distances
than in males.
How can these conjectures about the anatomical substrate
responsible for a male advantage in temporal processing be
reconciled with findings of (a) somewhat higher verbal
abilities in women and (b) the absence of mean sex
differences in psychometric intelligence? Meta-analyses
(Hyde & Linn, 1988; Lynn & Mikk, 2009) have shown a
reliable albeit very small female advantage in verbal
abilities, mainly related to speech production and reading
and writing abilities. This seems to be at odds with the
present finding of a male advantage in temporal processing
which extends to the processing of non-native speech
sounds. However, there is much more to verbal abilities
than the processing of non-native speech sounds, making it
unlikely that a sex difference in one capacity will dominate
the complex interaction of skills required for the various
aspects involved in language learning and processing.
Mean sex differences in general intelligence have
generally proven to be elusive (Johnson, Carothers & Deary,
2009) despite sex differences in reaction times (Der &
Deary, 2006) and temporal processing (Rammsayer &
Troche, 2010), – parameters that have been shown to be
predictive of general intelligence (Sheppard & Vernon,
2008). The present study is in agreement with these findings
as the trend towards slightly higher Culture Fair non-verbal
intelligence scores in men was not significant after
Bonferroni correction, despite the fact that Culture Fair

1777

scores correlated significantly with sensitivity to the
Norwegian tonal contrast. A review of research on sex
differences in various timed tests revealed that men are
faster on reaction time and finger tapping tests while women
are faster in naming and symbol copying and neither sex
outperforms the other in general intelligence (Roivainen,
2011). Thus, while reaction time and temporal information
processing appear to explain some of the variance in general
intelligence, other performance components are also bound
to play a role and these components do not necessarily favor
men.
It is important to keep in mind that the observed sex effect
in non-native speech sound processing was very small.
Future research will have to explore to what extent the male
advantage in non-native speech sound processing
generalizes to other tasks; e.g., identification tasks or AXBtasks which may be more taxing on working memory or on
the ability to form long-term representations of novel speech
sounds. It is even less clear whether the male advantage in
non-native speech sound processing benefits other aspects
of adult foreign language learning, such as morphosyntax or
vocabulary acquisition. To clarify these issues, studies of
individual differences in various aspects of language
learning should include sex as a variable into their analyses.
Despite these limitations, the reported findings underscore
the importance of studying sex differences in cognitive tasks
as one of the domains that allow researchers to explore
potential cognitive repercussions of neuro-anatomical
differences.
