   Participants. Twenty undergraduate students at the
University of California, San Diego, participated. All of
them were native speakers of English.
   Materials. There were 90 target words; all target words
were embedded in either a high-constraint (HC) or low-
constraint (LC) sentence. For example, “the hockey player
moved on the ice on his            ” (S1) was considered HC
while “The little girl was very happy when she
unwrapped her brand new                ” (S2) was LC for the
target “skates”. The target words in HC context were
generated 87% of the time, whereas the ones in LC context
were generated less than 3% of the time.
   Procedure. Participants were presented with the
sentences up to the target words, and asked to provide one-
word continuations for each sentence.
   Analysis. The first estimate of predictability of each
target word was derived by extracting the LSA connection

target, e.g., the previous content word of S1 is “ice,” while        Figure 2: ROC curves for Cloze, PreCont, AllW, and LS.
