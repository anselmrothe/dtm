the relations between the individual notes. The strength of
relational reasoning is in the ability to reason about the roles
that objects play rather than the literal features of those
objects (see Doumas, Hummel, & Sandhofer, 2008).
Similarly, the ability to recognize a melody (or it’s shape)
rests on appreciating the relationship between the pitches,
and not the specific frequencies of each note. To evaluate
the similarity between relational reasoning and music

plausible domain-general model of relational cognition.
