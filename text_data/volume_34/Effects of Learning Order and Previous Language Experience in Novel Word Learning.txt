Ellis, 2002) to suggest that early-acquired information is
processed faster than later acquired information. Although
research regarding AoA and sensitive periods
overwhelmingly suggests that learning earlier is better, there
is still much controversy regarding the mechanism behind
this early advantage.
   One explanation that has not been given much
consideration is that a more basic mechanism such as order
of learning may be responsible for this early advantage
(Burling & Yoshida, 2011). Recent experimental paradigms
have found that early-learned items are retained better than
later-learned items, even when difficulty and age and
amount of exposure are controlled (Izura et al., 2011;
Stewart & Ellis, 2008). This suggests that AoA effects could
actually be due to more basic order effects. The present
work further examines this possibility of order effects by

each object had two labels – one in each language. Objects

non-word database (Horst, 2009), produced and recorded by
a female native English speaker, and presented auditorily to
