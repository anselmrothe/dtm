                    General Discussion
In the present study, we attempted to re-examine the
vowel-size relationship in a way that distinguished between
two possible factors, formant frequencies of the vowels
(Experiment 1) and kinesthetic experience while
pronouncing the vowels (Experiment 2), using the speeded
classification paradigm.
   The results of Experiment 1 indicate that the component
formant frequencies of vowels on their own can explain the
vowel-size relationship, and the results of Experiment 2
indicate     that    the    static   kinesthetic    experience
(proprioception of the absolute size of oral cavity) may not
contribute to the vowel-size relationship.
   However, in the results of Experiment 2, the possibility
remains that the dynamic kinesthetic experience (the
temporal change of the relative size of the mouth) might
have elicited bigger/smaller images and had an influence on
the results. Furthermore, we cannot completely eliminate
the possibility that the dynamic kinesthetic experience may
have affected the results of Experiment 1 from the
viewpoint of motor theory (e.g., Liberman & Mattingly,
1985), which understands the perception of speech as vocal
tract gestures. From this viewpoint, the dynamic kinesthetic
experience automatically generated from hearing vowels
may have affected the judgments of size, and supported the
results of Experiment 1.
