Methods
Experiment 1: Behavioral study
Participants For the behavioral study, responses were
gathered using Amazon Mechanical Turk. There were 16
types of animation per condition, and 15 responses were
elicited for each animation, yielding a total of 240 responses
per condition. Participants were constrained to be from the
United States, and to have a minimum 95% approval rating
from prior Turk studies. The survey included several foil
questions (e.g., what is the color of the dots?), and responses
with incorrect answers to these questions were rejected.

   Additionally, each subject received a localizer scan
intended to define the pSTS and motion-sensitive area MT.
This consisted of three conditions in a blocked design:
biological motion (point-light displays [PLDs] depicting
human motion; cf Grossman et al. 2000), scrambled motion
(PLDs with initial dot positions scrambled), and static
luminance change (static dots changing in luminance). Each
subject received 2 or 3 runs lasting 7 minutes and 24
seconds each, and comprising 6 12s-long blocks per
condition separated by a 12s interstimulus interval.
Participants performed a one-back task on individual
animations within the blocks, to maintain attention.
fMRI Data Acquisition Data were acquired on a 3T
Siemens Tim Trio scanner, with a 32-channel head coil.
Following high-resolution anatomical scans, functional
images were acquired with an echo planar imaging pulse
sequence sensitive to blood-oxygen-dependent (BOLD)
contrast (repetition time [TR] = 1s, echo time [TE] = 30ms,
flip angle = 70°, voxel size 3x3x3mm, matrix 64x64, 16
axial slices). Because of our interest in specific brain
regions, we used a sequence with limited coverage (of
visual cortex and the STS), but a TR of 1s for increased
power and temporal resolution. The first four volumes of
each acquisition were discarded to allow the system to reach
steady state. For localizer scans, a similar pulse sequence
was used, but with TR=2 and full brain coverage (32 axial
slices).
fMRI Data Analysis Preprocessing and analysis of fMRI
data was carried out using the FMRIB Software Library
(FSL) version 4.1.8, supplemented with Freesurfer 4.5.
Preprocessing steps included rigid-body motion correction,
correction for interleaved slice timing, brain extraction,
spatial smoothing (5mm FWHM Gaussian kernel), and

for each ROI, testing for effects of 1) animacy (conditions 3
and 4 vs 1 and 2), 2) goal-directedness (2 and 4 vs 1 and 3),
3) irrationality (7 vs 5), and 4) wandering over irrationality
(8 vs 7). Responses were averaged when combining two
conditions. Additionally, a post-hoc test assessed the effect
of goal-directedness for animations with a tail (condition 4
versus 3) on the pSTS response.
                            Results
Behavioral results
The behavioral results are shown in figure 2. As predicted,
the presence of a tail or dot-chain significantly increased the
percept of animacy (t[958] = 19.43, p < 10-70). In
spontaneous post-scan self-reports from subjects who
participated in the fMRI experiment (a separate group of
subjects), many described the dot-chain stimuli as either a
“worm,” “snake,” or “tadpole,” that was “swimming” or
“wiggling.” Additionally, we observed that for stimuli with
tails, animations that contained a visible goal dot were rated
as more animate than those without. A post-hoc test of this
difference was significant (t[478] = 2.56, p < .02).
   Ratings of goal-directedness were increased by the
presence of a goal dot, as expected (t[958] = 25.40, p <
10-108). Additionally, goal-directedness ratings were lower
for irrationality than rational stimuli (t[478] = -13.86, p <
10-36), and for wandering than irrational stimuli (t[478] =
-24.79, p < 10-87).
   Ratings of irrationality were higher for irrational than
rational paths, as expected (t[478] = 18.00, p < 10-54).
Additionally, they were higher for wandering than irrational
paths (t[478] = 8.96, p < 10-17). The presence of a goal dot
also influenced irrationality ratings, with higher ratings for
stimuli without a visible goal (t[958] = -11.27, p < 10-27).
Thus, we found an inverse relationship between ratings of
goal-directedness and irrationality: namely, animations
depicting an efficient path toward a clear goal were rated as
highly goal-directed and rational, while paths that lacked a
clear goal or used an inefficient trajectory were rated as less
goal-directed and more irrational.
fMRI results
Results from the right pSTS ROI analysis are shown in
figure 3. The ROI was found in 19 out of 20 subjects. We
found no effect of the animacy manipulation (t[18] = -.03, p
= .98), nor the goal dot manipulation (t[18] = -1.17, p = .26).
However, the pSTS did respond more strongly to irrational
than rational stimuli (t[18] = -2.25, p < .05), and to
wandering than irrational stimuli (t[18] = 3.03, p < .01).             Figures 3 (above) and 4: Mean beta values extracted from right
