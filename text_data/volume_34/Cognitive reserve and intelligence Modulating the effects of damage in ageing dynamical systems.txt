might thus be explained by: (a) steeper gradients in the
activation functions; (b) a greater number of pre-existing
levels of connections (or, weights) between processing
units; or, (c) lower rates of cell death.
  Thomas (2008) recently examined issues concerning
ageing and cognitive reserve within a connectionist model
of English past tense learning. In these simulations, aging
was implemented separately via: (1) a reduction of gradient
in processing units; and, (2) a reduction (loss) of
connections. CR was implemented via manipulating the
number of hidden units within the model. Specifically, low
cognitive reserve models were assigned 50 hidden units (a
level just sufficient to allow the model to learn) and high
cognitive reserve models were assigned 100 hidden units.
Damage, applied at various different timepoints, was
implemented by probabilistically removing 50% of the
connection weights in the network. This work is notable in
that it provides an explicit test of one role of CR in
modulating the effects of damage within a cognitive
domain. There are relatively few studies that have sought to
develop on this approach. Furthermore, most computational              Figure 1: Five alternative model architectures. Note, this

Simulations
In both the Normal and Damaged models, Ageing and IQ
were implemented by manipulating values of the capacity
for each process (K).
Ageing: General cognitive decline was simulated by
applying a fixed level of decay (0.075%) to the capacity (K)
of each process from 400 timesteps onwards. For the present
simulations, we did not examine the consequences of
variability in the rate, or the onset of decay.
IQ: To create Low IQ, Average IQ and High IQ models,
models were calibrated to begin with different starting
values of K (Low IQ=2, Average IQ=3, and High IQ=4).
Cognitive Reserve: For the passive form of CR, we tested
three levels of Connection strength between processes (M).

effects of damage are: (1) Area - the extent to which the
trajectories of processes in the Damaged model resembles
those in the Normal model (we compute the area under the
curve, for each Damaged processes, and this is turned into a
proportion of the area of the processes in the Normal
model); and, (2) Endstate level – the extent to which the
endstate levels of the Damage model reaches the functional
endstate of the Normal model. Thus, area gives a measure of
models attempt to compensate for damage, and endstate
provides a measure of the models ability to recover.

Low Connectivity, are 11769.8, 17654.6 and 23539.5,

within a given level of Connectivity, the effect of damage
was proportionate at each level of IQ. For example, in the
