performance for the surprise test was 65.8%, which was
statistically different from chance (t (46) = 3.08, p = .001).
More importantly, the recognition for the target-aligned
words (61.0%, SE=.11) was not statistically different from
non-aligned words (61.5%, SE=.57; t (17)= .03, p = .97; see
Figure 2). Note that the overall performance was higher due
to increased performance on correctly rejecting foils. The
correct rejection of foil words was compared with overall
performance for target-aligned and non-aligned words.
There was a significant difference between recognition for
target-aligned words and correct rejections (target-aligned:
