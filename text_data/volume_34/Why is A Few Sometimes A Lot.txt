Materials and Procedure Participants were seated at a
computer table beside an experimenter. The study was
composed of three parts: two training tasks, and the main
task. First, the participants were introduced to the format of
the task. They were instructed that they would be told some
short stories. Accompanying these stories would be pictures
displayed on the computer screen. They were instructed that
when the stories were completed that they would be asked
questions about the stories. In order to respond to these
questions the participants were asked to make a selection
between three cards visible on the screen. Participants
would indicate the answer they thought was correct.
Additionally, they were told that only two of the cards
would have visible answers, and if they did not think that
the correct answer was on the visible cards that they should
choose the blank card.
   In the first training task participants were given three
trials where they were asked to locate specific items (e.g.,
toy car, teddy bear, 2 monkeys) using the three card               Figure 1: Example of Experiment 3 design. Row 1: an

does context tell us what quantity is picked out by a few?
The answer to this question can perhaps be found by
determining the semantic form of a few and other gradable
quantifiers with respect to the form of gradable adjectives.
Secondly, it would be interesting to investigate whether all
quantifiers are gradable like a few, or if it is the case that
only some quantifiers are gradable in this way; it would be
interesting to study what makes a specific quantifier
gradable. Finally, the structure of gradable quantifiers seems
like it would be very difficult to acquire. Given that both a
few and a lot can be used in variable contexts to mean either
a small quantity, or a relatively large quantity, how do
children learn that what is important about gradable
quantifiers is the context in which they are used, and not a
definite number range?
   The results of the present study support the Gradable
Quantifier Hypothesis, suggesting that context-dependency
is built into the meaning of terms such as a few, and rejects
the Definite Number Hypothesis. This finding opens up a
host of interesting questions about the gradability of other
terms, and the acquisition of gradable quantifiers. Current
research in the authors’ lab aims to answer these questions
with future and ongoing studies.
