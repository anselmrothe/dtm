with 1,024 × 768 pixel resolution and at 75 Hz refresh rate.
Each optic-flow display consisted of 16,000 randomly
placed white dots on a black background. The dots were
uniformly distributed within a simulated cube which
subtended 72 (horizontal) x 57 (vertical) deg in visual angle.
The stimuli were displayed on a 50-inch plasma display,
with a viewing distance of 57 cm. The optic-flow simulated
the forward or backward self-motion in constant-velocity

durations were orally reported.
          There was additionally the static-plane condition.
A static random-dot plane was virtually placed 30 cm
farther than the optic-flow plane (Figure 1). The farther dot
plane effectively inhibited self-motion perception (e.g. Seno
et al., 2010).
          There were three stimulus conditions, optic flow,
DRD and the static-plane conditions. The expected vection
strengths were strong, medium and nothing for optic flow,
static-plane and DRD conditions respectively. The
destination of the trip was randomly chosen from ten very
famous world cities (e.g. New York, Tokyo, etc.). The
expected vection strengths for the three conditions were
estimated from our previous study (Seno et al., 2010). Those        Figure 2. The shrinkage of the return travel. Error bars
