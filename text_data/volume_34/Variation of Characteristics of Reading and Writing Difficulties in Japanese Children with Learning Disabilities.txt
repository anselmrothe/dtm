processing are the ability to analyze the phonological
structure of sound and the ability to recognize its characters.
According to the phonological model, the difficulty results
from an impaired ability to segment spoken words into
phonologic parts and link each letter to its corresponding
sound (Shaywitz, 2003; Shaywitz & Shaywitz, 2005).
Phonemes are small units of sound that can be
conceptualized as the building blocks of words (for example,
the word cat is comprised of three phonemes: k, aaaa, and t).
That is the ability to analyze phonological structure. The
Japanese language is based on a subsyllabic unit, the mora
(Otake, Hatano, Cutler, & Mehler, 1993). According to
magnocellular theory, the difficulty results from
abnormalities of the magnocellular component of the visual
system, which is specialized to quickly process temporal
information (Stein & Walsh, 1997). That is the ability to
recognize character. Furthermore, not only cognitive ability,
but also the ability to correctly produce sound is necessary
for reading. And handwriting abilities are necessary for
writing letters correctly. Therefore, it is also important to
possess these abilities. Moreover, in reading, there are two
strategies, one is a lexical strategy based on whole word
recognition and another a sub-lexical processing strategy
based on a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (Wydell &
Butterworth, 1999). This means that if we want to know the           Figure 1: Hypothesis of granularity and transparency and

check not only word tests, but also non-word tests.                                    & Butterworth (1999).

rather by a combination of factors. Furthermore, the
combination of individual elements is different. This means
that students with learning disabilities need separate support
even they have the same symptoms or reading and writing
difficulties.
  In the four elements, a higher percentage of children were
considered to have problems with visual perception. Type 4
children passed the phonological processing task even
though they failed the visual perception task. This result
may be caused by Japanese education methods. The
simultaneous oral spelling method is a good way for
dyslexic children to acquire reading and writing skills
(Thomson, 1996). Typical Japanese education methods,
however, utilize simultaneous oral spelling techniques.
Japanese has multiple characters that are similar to each
other. Also, there are many strokes in Japanese Kanji.
Therefore, we need to study the influence of visual
perception on difficulties in reading and writing Japanese in
the future.
  The groundbreaking discovery of our study was that there
were many children who have poor handwriting abilities.
Stroke order is believed to very important in Japanese
education.                                                          Figure 2: Transparency dimension of Kana from character

hard for these children to write in handwriting stroke order.
When considering the difficulty of writing, handwriting
ability wasn’t considered. However, from the viewpoint of
quality of life, it is necessary to know a child’s handwriting
ability in an assessment. If a child has poor handwriting
ability, he or she should be supported and taught that the
stroke order is not necessarily important. In Japan, it is an
accepted practice to learn characters from a set of reading
and writing lessons. However, this method is not good for
children who have poor writing abilities, in particular type 5
children, like child B, who have difficulty only with
handwriting. These children need support in the form of
separate reading and writing practice.
  In this study, only child F failed the phonological
awareness task. This supports the granularity dimension of
“the Hypothesis of Granularity and Transparency.”
However, some children failed the phonological processing
task because they failed the Katakana test. In particular,
child L, a type 6, passed other tasks like the phonological
awareness task, visual perception task and handwriting
ability task. Why is there difficulty only in the Katakana
phonological processing? Kana is a one-to-one from a
character standpoint, but not a one-to-one transparent from a
sound standpoint. This is illustrated in Figure 2.
  Considering this, granularity and transparency and                Figure 3: Granularity and transparency and orthography-to-
