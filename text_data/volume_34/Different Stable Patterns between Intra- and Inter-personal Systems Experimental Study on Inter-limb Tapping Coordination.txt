                          Method
Participants
A total of 30 healthy right-handed participants (15 males
and 15 females) took part in the experiment, with 10
participants in the intra-personal condition and 10 pairs of
participants (i.e., 20 participants) in the inter-personal
condition. All participants were between 21 and 47 years of
age (average age=26.9). The procedure was approved by the
ethics committee at the National Institute of Informatics,
where the experiment was conducted.
Apparatus
A computer-generated metronome produced beeps, each

gradually from 1 Hz to 3 Hz over a 30-s trial after an initial
3-s period at 1 Hz. The metronome was run on a personal
computer (Apple MacBook2130/13.3), and the beep sounds
were conveyed to the participants through headphones
(Sony MDR-NC600D) at a comfortable volume adjusted for
each participant. A camcorder (TK-C1380; Victor), as part
of the motion analyzer system DKH Frame-DIAS II,
videotaped the movements of the participants’ index fingers
at 60 fields per second through the two-dimensional motion
capture function of the Frame-DIAS II. The tapping
movements and auditory stimuli were recorded on a hard
disk drive (HDD) (Sony HVR-DR-60).

present study, to assess the effect of frequency on
performance, the relative phase was calculated and the
standard deviation of the relative phase was obtained with
respect to six 5-sec intervals.
Average number of phase transitions To measure the
stability of movement in terms of temporally global stability,
the average number of phase transitions was obtained as
follows. When the right and left index fingers tapped
together within a time window of 67 msec, derived from the
video camera’s frame rate, the tapping was categorized as
being in the in-phase mode. When the time interval between
one finger’s peak of flexion (tap) and the other finger’s peak
of extension was within a time window of 67 msec, the tap
was considered to be in the anti-phase mode. We considered
that a phase transition would take place only if the taps in
the opposite phase mode occurred at least five times in a
row. The average number of phase transitions was obtained
by counting the number of phase transitions in each of the
phase mode conditions for each participant and each pair of
participants.

Average time-to-transition We calculated the average
time-to-transition in order to measure the temporally global
stability, following a previous study’s method (Riek and
