Imaging procedures
fMRI scans were conducted with the 3T GE SignaHDxt scan-
ner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) at Tokyo Institute of
Technology, Japan. High-resolution anatomical images were
obtained using an FSPGR T1-weighted sequence [repetition
time (TR) = 7.712 msec; echo time (TE) = 2.88 msec, flip
angle (FA) = 11 deg, slice thickness = 1 mm; in-plane resolu-
tion = 1 x 1 mm2 ]. Functional images were obtained using a
GE-EPI sequence [TR = 2.0 sec, TE = 30 msec, FA = 90 deg,
slice thickness = 3.0 mm, in-plane resolution = 3.75 x 3.75
mm2 , slice gap = 1.0 mm].
Imaging analysis procedures
Imaging analysis was performed using SPM8
