                                        distinct sections. Therefore, by dividing the overall

                                        (therefore the first section of the dance performance) took
                                        64 seconds and the second took 95 seconds. The third
                                        section of the dance performance was determined by the
                                        time when the dancers finished the dance. The third section
                                        of H’s solo took 99 seconds, and M’s took 98 seconds. That
                                        of the duo performance took 111 seconds. The results of the
                                        centre of gravity analysis are shown in Table 3.
                                           During the first section of the duo performance, the
                                        dancers somewhat adjusted their own movements to their
                                        partner’s. H’s score for the change in the centre of the
                                        gravity was higher (1.03) in the solo performance, and
                                        became lower (0.83) in the duo performance. M’s score
                                        changed in the opposite direction (from 0.19 to 0.69). This
                                        result is consistent with the introspective data. According to
                                        the introspective reports, when paying attention to the dance
                                        partner, dancers sometimes adjusted their dance movements
                                        to the partner's and sometimes created a contrast during the
