(Part 1:) In a study 1000 people were tested. Among the participants there were 5 engineers and 995 lawyers. Jack is a randomly
chosen participant of this study.
(Part 2:) Jack is 36 years old. He is not married and is somewhat introverted. He likes to spend his free time reading science fiction
and writing computer programs.
    Statement (heuristic): Jack is an engineer.                Statement (non-heuristic): Jack is a lawyer.

is a randomly chosen participant of this study.
(Part 2:) Ellen likes to listen to hip hop and rap music. She enjoys wearing tight shirts and jeans. She’s fond of dancing and has a
small nose piercing.
Statement (heuristic): Ellen is sixteen.                                    Statement (non-heuristic): It is equally likely that Ellen is

Liverpool. Chris is a randomly chosen participant of this study.

problem type interaction were not significant. That is,
participants, regardless of condition, liked description-based
responses more if these were not in conflict with base rates.
     Another issue that we were interested in was whether
participants’ liking ratings were higher for heuristic
responses than for non-heuristic responses. To investigate
this question, we first collapsed ratings across conflict and
neutral problems. As we described in the introduction, in
the case of both types of task there is a general tendency for
participants to disregard base rates. This is assumed to be
the consequence of an automatic (i.e., heuristic) tendency to
generate responses that correspond to (or take into account)
the descriptions (cf. Kahneman & Frederick, 2005).
     The average ratings for heuristic and base rate responses
in the intuitive condition were M=3.17 (SD=.51) and                     Figure 1: The probability of selecting a response as a
