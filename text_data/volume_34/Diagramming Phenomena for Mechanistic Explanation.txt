Johnson introduced the actogram as a better format for this
purpose. In essence, he unrolled each circular tracing (one
day’s data) into a straight line and placed each line below
the previous one such that the hours of all days were in
alignment. In this first actogram (Figure 2, right side), three
sets of lines were presented so as to compare mice from
three different environments (greenhouse, from lab to
woods, and woods). Within a set, the top line is Day 1, se-
cond line is Day 2, and so forth. Comparison was made
more precise by running a vertical line at two-hour intervals,
beginning and ending at 6 am. A shorter vertical line
marked the onset of sunset, a convention not maintained by
subsequent researchers. A major virtue of the actogram is
that viewers can employ their visual ability to detect differ-
ences in the pattern of marks so as to compare circadian
rhythms across days or conditions. It can be seen that these
nocturnal animals are active primarily at night, with varia-
tions between conditions in onset time and in the extent of
daytime activity but considerable stability across days with-

   A variety of conventions have been developed to indicate
temporary changes in conditions. In Figure 4, the gray arrow
indicates a day on which a light pulse was presented four
hours after activity onset. This not only caused activity to
mostly cease for that evening, but also inserted a phase de-
lay the next day into what was otherwise a continuing pat-
tern of phase advance due to constant darkness.
