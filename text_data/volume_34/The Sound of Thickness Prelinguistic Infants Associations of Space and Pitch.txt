   One possibility is that children could start out with both a
height-pitch and a thickness-pitch mapping even before they
learn language. The strength of these mappings might then
subsequently be adjusted, according to the relative
frequencies of space-pitch metaphors in the languages
children acquire (Casasanto 2008, 2010; Dolscheid et al.,
submitted; Smith & Sera, 1992). Alternatively, height-pitch
and thickness-pitch associations might follow different
trajectories. Whereas height-pitch associations are available         b
to prelinguistic infants, the thickness-pitch mapping might
only be learned later. Metaphors in language could provide
one possible way to learn this association. Using thickness
terminology to refer to pitch may invite speakers to align
correspondent representations and extract similarities
between space and pitch in a process called structural
alignment (see e.g. Boroditsky, 2001; Gentner, 2003). In
line with this proposal, Shayan et al. (submitted) found that
