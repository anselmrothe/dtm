timing is critical in real-time dynamic tasks that require
adaptive responses to the changing environment. For
instance, when driving it is necessary to estimate how long
one can attend to a navigator before switching back to
attending to the road and driving control (Salvucci, Taatgen,
& Kushleyeva, 2006).
   Time estimation can be studied under various paradigms
(Zakay, 1990). Participants can be asked to retrospectively
generate verbal estimation of an interval, to judge whether a
presented interval is the same length as a target interval, or
reproduce a target interval. Studies using the reproduction
paradigm typically show response distributions that are 1)
centered at the real-time criteria, 2) symmetrical, and 3)                Figure 1: Schematic representation of the Space Fortress

   As a time interval estimation task, the IFF tapping task                       The IFF Tapping Experiment
has three notable characteristics. First, it is a prospective            We tested those two hypotheses in a within-subjects

most importantly, it is performed not as an isolated task but
as part of a real-time complex task. The game requires time-
sharing multiple tasks such as navigating the ship while
dealing with the fortress and the mines. Even within the
mine task, a series of activities precede (checking the letter
and determining the mine’s identity) and follow (aiming the
ship and firing a missile) the IFF tapping task, all of which
need to be completed within a brief period of time, usually
2-3 seconds.

each trial, when a letter (either F or J) appeared in the center
of the screen, participants simply produced the IFF interval

game had eight trials.
   Twenty participants (5 males, mean age: 19 yrs) from
Carnegie Mellon University participated in the experiment.
The experiment consisted of 12 blocks of games. Each
block had one intermediate-tap-only game, one fast-tap
game, and one slow-tap game in a randomized order.

overall performed very well (mean accuracy: 86%).
Importantly, the too-early bias was not present confirming
our prediction. Participants committed too-early and too-late
errors with roughly equal frequencies in the first block, but
they quickly reduced their too-early errors. Thus, there was
a small too-late bias on later trials, which may reflect a floor
effect on the shortest intervals participants could produce.          Figure 4: IFF tapping performance in fast/slow-tap games.
