duties consist of seeking to attain three moral values: (1)
Autonomy, (2) Non-Maleficence and (3) Beneficence. In the
moral reasoner, the three duties are seen as ‘moral goals’ to
satisfy everyone’s needs as much as possible. This
corresponds with Super’s conceptualization of the
relationship between needs and values: “values are
objectives that one seeks to attain to satisfy a need” (Super,
1973). The moral reasoner aims to pick actions that serve
these moral goals best.
   What priorities should be given to these three moral
goals? According to Anderson and Anderson (2008), the
following consensus exists in medical ethics. A healthcare
worker should challenge a patient's decision only if the
patient is not capable of fully autonomous decision making
(e.g., the patient has irrational fears about an operation) and          Figure 1: Moral reasoner shown in graphical format
