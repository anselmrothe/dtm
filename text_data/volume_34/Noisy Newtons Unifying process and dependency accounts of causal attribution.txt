   The psychological literature on causal learning and attribu-
tion neatly maps onto the two major accounts in philosophy.                Rather than fostering the divide between process accounts
On the one hand, people have been shown to use contingency              and dependency accounts, we propose a theory of causal attri-
information when drawing inferences about whether and how               bution that combines the best of both worlds. In the spirit of
strongly two events are causally linked (Cheng, 1997). On               Pearl (2000), we model causal attributions in terms of counter-

dependence (Walsh & Sloman, 2011).                                      Bayes net. We aim to unify process and dependency accounts
   A point that has been raised in favor of process accounts            by showing that people have intuitive theories in the form of
is that they are capable of capturing the semantics of differ-          detailed generative models, and that causal judgements are
