1982; Ivry & Robertson, 1998), motivating the use of this
asymmetry to model tasks involving local/global processing.
   Hsiao et al. used this connectivity pattern as inspiration
to implement a simple “autoencoder” neural network with
differential connectivity (see Figure 2) to encode the stim-
uli, and a simple perceptron to perform the task using the
autoencoders’ learned representations (see Methods section
for details on this model). They tested it to see whether this
anatomical asymmetry could account for a subset of the data
modeled by Ivry and Robertson. Using precisely the same
