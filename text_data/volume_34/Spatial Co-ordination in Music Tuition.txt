Co-present Lesson Interactions
The rooms where lessons took place were small, the space
constrained by the piano and the music stand. Nonetheless, in
each case, tutors used their position relative to the student and
the music stand to communicate their intention to act. This
led to the establishment of specific zones within the space,
which both participants could be seen to observe. To illustrate
this we present vignettes illustrating examples of the use of                     Figure 3: Moving out of the work zone.
