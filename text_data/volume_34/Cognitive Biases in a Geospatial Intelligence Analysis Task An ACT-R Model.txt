  An ACT-R model of sensemaking in a geospatial intelligence
                                                                       intelligence).
  task was developed based on Instance-Based Learning Theory
  (IBLT). The model (a) maintains hypotheses about the
  probability of attacks by insurgent groups, (b) seeks new
  information based on those hypotheses, and (c) updates
  hypotheses based on new evidence. The model provides a
  functional account of how these sensemaking processes are
  carried out in a cognitive architecture, and model performance
  can be compared to normative (Bayesian) standards.
  Simulations exhibit two well-known cognitive biases that are
  frequently identified as problems in intelligence analysis: (1)
  anchoring in the weighting of new evidence and (2)
  confirmation bias in seeking new information.
