Participants
Fifty-two Americans (mean age = 40) and Fourteen Iranian-
Americans (Iranians living in Southern California for more
than 5 years) (mean age = 34.61) participated in this study.
The participants were recruited using craigslist.com and
snowball sampling, which consisted of asking subjects to re-
fer other subjects for the study. Each subject received $25 at
the end of the experiment for participating. The participants
were not aware that they were participating in a culture study.
Each participant completed the task in individual experimen-
tal sessions.

      ... My classmate Shawn, who I’m not really good friends with and don’t know too well, invited me to a bonfire at the beach. I
      told him that I was hungry and needed to get something to eat before going to the beach. He was going to his parent’s house for
      dinner and invited me over. I don’t know him well, so I initially refused his offer. But he kept on insisting that it’s the beginning
      of Spring and I should go and have dinner with his family. On the way to his house, Shawn asked why I was wearing almost all
      green . I thought it was a strange question as a lot of students were wearing green that day...
      I went over to his house and met his dad at the living room. I thought to myself that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Upon
      seeing his father, Shawn introduced me to him, saying this is my good friend Anthony. He seemed surprised by my presence.
      Now I wasn’t sure if they were expecting a guest for dinner. Then Shawn’s mother came to the living room. I had met her before.
      She used to work in the registrar of the school. I said hi to her and she greeted me back saying that it looked like water had gone
      under my skin...
      ... I didn’t understand why they were asking me to stay for dinner, because I think they didn’t have any dinner prepared.
      ... I saw a very small art piece on the wall of their hallway. It was a picture of some Chinese looking guys playing with a ball on
      horses. I told his dad that this is a lovely picture. He thanked me and told me that I could take it. I first thought he was kidding,
      but he seemed serious and told me that he wants me to take it. Shawn’s mother also said that it will look better in my house and I
      should take it. Given that they were insisting so much, and the piece didn’t look expensive I took it and thanked them for it.
      ... Shawn’s parents told Shawn that they had to wait for another hour and a half to serve dinner because some family friends had
      just called and were coming to visit them for the first day of spring. Given that I had plans to go watch the game and couldn’t wait
      that long, I got up thanked them for the picture and salad, and had my friend pick me up. Shawn and his parents insisted that I
      should wait and have dinner with them. But my friend was already there to pick me up...
