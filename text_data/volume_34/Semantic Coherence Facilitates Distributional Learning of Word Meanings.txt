Abstract

found that subjects recall “grammatical” MN and PQ sentences but also tend to recall ungrammatical MQ and PN sentences, suggesting that they learn position regularities (that
M/P come first and N/Q come second) but not co-occurrence
regularities (that M co-occurs with N but not Q and that P
occurs with Q but not N). MNPQ learning has been an important paradigm because it provides an empirical means to
consider purely distributional learning of word categories.
Braine (1987) investigated the effect of correlating cooccurrence regularities with natural gender. Subjects acquired an artificial language by learning to name pictures of
referents. In the experimental condition, all pictures of men
were labeled by M words and all pictures of women were
labeled by P words. Learning of the co-occurrence regularities was significantly higher in the experimental condition
than in a control condition where natural gender was not predictive of M/P membership. Though Braine’s experiment
combined distributional cues with natural gender, he suggested that phonological cues might better serve real-world
language learners. For instance, Spanish and Italian speakers might learn grammatical gender categories by taking advantage of the fact that feminine nouns often end with -a,
while masculine nouns often end with -o. Recently, this suggestion received attention in the work of Lany and Saffran
(2010), who found that 22-month old infants learned MNPQ
co-occurrence regularities when they were aligned with the
number of syllables in a word – that is, when N words were
disyllabic and Q words were monosyllabic, but not when the
number of syllables was not predictive of N/Q membership.
The defining feature of the artificial language learning
paradigm is that, at the outset of the experiment, subjects do
not know the meanings of any of the words. Yet, this condition generally does not hold true for real language learners,
who typically know the meanings of some words but not others. It is plausible that the presence of known words facilitates
distributional learning. If this is true, how effective are such
semantic cues, and how do they compare to (e.g.) phonological cues? Here, we report the initial results of the first largescale study comparing the effectiveness of various correlated
cues on distributional learning. We presented subjects with an
MNPQ language where sentences took the form “M and N”
or “P and Q”. We hypothesized that distributional learning
would be afforded given a certain level of semantic coherence, where all M and P words were familiar and adhered to
some semantic organization (e.g., M = animal words, P =
vehicle words). For instance, hearing the four sentences “cat
and dax”, “cat and ziv”, “car and wug”, and “car and pif”
might allow learners to infer that daxes and zivs belong to the

Computational work has suggested that one could, in principle, learn aspects of word meaning simply from patterns of
co-occurrence between words. The extent to which humans
can do this distributional learning is an open question – artificial language learning experiments have yielded mixed results,
prompting suggestions that distributional cues must be correlated with other cues, such as phonological regularities, for
successful learning. We conducted a large-scale experiment
comparing how distributional learning is afforded by two different types of cues – phonological regularities and semantic
coherence. We found that semantic coherence more strongly
facilitates distributional learning than onset-consonant phonological regularities.

Introduction
How do people learn what words mean? According to the
distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1951; Firth, 1957), patterns
of word co-occurrence are a powerful source of information
about word meaning. It may be possible to acquire some
facets of word meaning by simply keeping track of which
linguistic contexts words appear in, even without access to
any physical or social cues. Computational models have lent
quantitative support for the distributional hypothesis. For example, the Latent Semantic Analysis model of Landauer &
Dumais (1997) clustered words according to their patterns of
occurrence across documents and was able to closely match
human performance on synonym tests. The success of early
models like LSA led to a proliferation of models that use distributional information to learn word meaning (see Riordan &
Jones, 2010 for an overview) as well as other linguistic properties such as syntactic category (e.g., Redington, Chater, &
Finch, 1998).
We know that distributional learning is computationally
possible, but the evidence of human capacity for distributional learning is mixed. Some research has found that people learn co-occurrence statistics and use them to inform categorization (Mintz, 2002; Gerken, Wilson, & Lewis, 2005;
Reeder, Newport, & Aslin, 2010), but other work has reached
the opposite conclusion (Braine, 1966; Smith, 1966; Frank
& Gibson, 2009). A holistic reading of the literature suggests that learning is more likely to occur when additional
cues are correlated with distributional properties. Below, we
review two representative findings using the MNPQ artificial
language learning paradigm (Braine, 1966; Smith, 1966).
The MNPQ grammar contains four categories of words –
M, N, P, and Q – and sentences take one of two forms: MN
and PQ. Early investigations (Braine, 1966; Smith, 1966)

same category, as both words co-occur with “cat”, and that
wugs and pifs belong to the same category, as both words
co-occur with “car”.
In Experiment 1, we tested whether semantic coherence
facilitated distributional learning. In Experiments 2 and 3,
we compared semantic coherence to phonological coherence
and semantic incoherence (the presence of known words that
do not adhere to some semantic organization).

to turn on their speakers and click a button, which played
a spoken English word. Subjects were required to correctly
type the word to continue. The experiment had four phases
– exposure, similarity, memory, and referent assign. Below,
we detail these phases (for purposes of exposition, we have
switched the order of memory and similarity).
Exposure. Subjects listened to sentences from the language. We withheld six sentences from exposure (see Figure 1), yielding 14 unique sentences in the exposure set. Each
sentence was heard either 4, 9, 14, or 28 times, giving 56,
126, 196, or 392 total trials. We presented the sentences in
random order subject to the constraint that there were no repeated words between consecutive trials (pilot testing suggested that repeated words substantially afforded learning).
To encourage compliance, subjects had to click a button to
hear each sentence.
Memory. Subjects listened to sentences and judged on a 5
point scale how confident they were that they had previously
heard the sentence during exposure. We tested four types of
sentences – familiar sentences heard during exposure, withheld sentences not heard during exposure but conforming to
the MNPQ structure, cross-category sentences of the form
MQ and PN, and position-violation sentences of the form
MM, NN, PP, and QQ. Sentences were presented in random order such that there were no repeated words between
consecutive trials. In two catch trials, instead of a sentence
from the MNPQ language, we played a non-repeatable audio instruction to press a specific response button. If subjects
learned the MN and PQ co-occurrence relationships, then we
expected that they would rate novel grammatical sentences
respecting the co-occurrence relationships as more familiar
than the cross-category sentences violating the co-occurrence
relationships.
Similarity. For each pair of words in the union of N and
Q, we asked subjects to rate on a 5 point scale how similar
they believed the two words to be in meaning. This resulted
in within-category judgments (e.g., n1 vs. n2 ) and crosscategory judgments (e.g., n1 vs. q1 ). We presented the pairs
in a fixed pseudorandom order containing no repeated words
between consecutive trials. Though exposure was entirely auditory, for convenience, we presented these similarity questions as text (e.g., “How similar are pif
and thite
?”);
to facilitate mapping between visual and spoken word forms,
the speaker button next to each word played the spoken word
when clicked. In two catch trials, subjects were asked to press
the response button corresponding to the solution of a simple arithmetic problem. If subjects learned the MN and PQ

Experiment 1: Semantic Coherence
We parametrically varied two independent variables: (1) the
amount of exposure to the language and (2) semantic coherence – the fraction of known words that adhered to a taxonomic organization (M = animal words, P = vehicle words).
We then applied three measures of MNPQ learning – sentence
memory, similarity rating, and a referent assignment task.

Method
Participants 654 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
workers participated in the study. Using MTurk’s worker
qualifications we limited participation to workers located in
the US and with a previous HIT approval rate ≥ 90%. We
chose MTurk workers because the number of experimental
conditions required a large number of subjects.
Materials Sentences took the form “M and N” or “P and
Q” (see Figure 1). We generated the actual lexical items
randomly for each subject. N’s and Q’s were always novel
nonsense words and were drawn without replacement from
{moke, thite, jiv, pif, dex, wug}. M’s and P’s could be either
novel or familiar. Novel M’s were drawn from {feeb, bim,
lup} and novel P’s were drawn from {zabe, vap, chuv}. Familiar M’s and P’s obeyed a taxonomic organization – familiar M’s were drawn from {hamster, cat, dog} (animal words)
and familiar P’s were drawn from {car, bus, truck} (vehicle words). To create the audio files, we input the sentences
as “X. and. Y.” (e.g., “car. and. chuv.”, including periods)
into an American English text-to-speech engine using a female voice. The periods between words introduced substantial pauses ranging in length from 150 to 300 ms; piloting
revealed that without pauses, it was difficult for participants
to distinguish the words. Sentences using only monosyllabic
words were around 2 seconds long. Sentences using the sole
disyllabic word, hamster, were around 3 seconds long.
The referent assignment task involved visual referents. For
the context words, we used 128x128 pixel images of a cat,
dog, hamster, car, bus, and truck. For the target words, we
used 100x100 pixel images of a horse, rabbit, sheep, bear,
goldfish, mouse, boat, van, train, motorcycle, plane, and bicycle.
Design and Procedure We parametrically varied coherence – the number of familiar M and P words. The language
for a subject contained either 0/3, 1/3, 2/3, or 3/3 familiar M
and P words each. We also varied the amount of exposure
to the language – subjects heard either 56, 126, 196, or 392
sentences. Before starting the experiment, we asked subjects

terested in main effects of coherence on score. Second, as one
hallmark of statistical learning is sensitivity to the amount of
evidence observed, we were interested in the relationship between amount of exposure and score. Accordingly, we looked
for exposure × coherence interactions. A significant interaction would indicate a difference in how efficiently the statistical learning process makes use of evidence at different
coherence levels. For all scores, we coded coherence as a categorical variable and analyzed the data using an interactive
regression model: score ∼ exposures × condition. To examine the differences between the different coherence levels, we
used Helmert contrasts analyzing (i) the difference between
the 1/3 and 0/3 conditions, (ii) the difference between the 2/3
condition and the 0/3 and 1/3 conditions combined, and (iii)
the difference between the 3/3 condition and the 0/3, 1/3, and
2/3 conditions combined. Results of these analyses are shown
in Table 1.

co-occurrence relationships and used these relationships as a
basis for lexical categorization, then we expected that withincategory pairs of words would be rated as more similar than
cross-category pairs.

Referent assignment. Subjects made 2AFC referent assignments for the N and Q words (see Figure 2). At the top of
the screen, we displayed the M and P words in random order. Under each word, we showed an image of an associated
referent. The referents corresponded to the familiar pools
for M and P words: CAT, DOG, HAMSTER, CAR, BUS, and
TRUCK . Familiar words were always associated with the obvious referents (e.g., “dog” was always paired with an image
of a dog). Below the “seeded” word meanings, we displayed
a row containing the N and Q words. Under each word, we
displayed a 2AFC referent choice between an animal (the
“correct” choice for N words) and vehicle words (the “correct” choice for Q words); subjects made a choice by clicking on one of the two pictures. If subjects learned the MN
and PQ co-occurrence relationships and used them to form
nascent lexical categories and used these lexical categories as
a basis for inferences about word meaning, then we expected
that referent assignment scores would reflect a tendency to
choose on the basis of the taxonomic categories of the cooccurring words (e.g., N’s should be animals because they
co-occur with M’s, which are known to be animals).

Memory There were significant main effects of exposure
and condition, with scores in the 3/3 condition being significantly higher than in the other conditions combined. Additionally, there was a significant exposure × condition interaction; the effect of exposures on score was significantly
higher in 3/3 than in the other conditions combined, suggesting greater efficiency of statistical learning in 3/3. Thus, more
coherent linguistic input (1) bolstered memory for the MN
and PQ co-occurrence regularities and (2) increased the efficiency of the statistical learning process responsible for learning those regularities, at least in the 3/3 condition.

Results and Discussion
We excluded the 47 subjects who did not correctly answer all
of the catch trials. Results are shown in Figure 3. Next, for
each dependent measure – memory, similarity, and meaning
– we defined a within-subject score representing the sensitivity to the co-occurrence regularities in the language. Memory
score was the difference in mean ratings between novel withheld sentences (e.g., m1 –n1 ) and novel category violation sentences (e.g., m1 –q1 ). Similarity score was the difference between mean ratings of within-category (e.g., N–N) and crosscategory (e.g N–Q) ratings. Referent assignment score was
the total number of correct choices in the referent assignment
task. We analyzed two aspects of the data. First, we were in-

score was significantly higher in 3/3 than in the other conditions combined. Thus, more coherent linguistic input (1)
increased the distinction between within-category and crosscategory pairs of words and (2) increased the efficiency of
the statistical learning process involved in making such distinctions, at least in the 3/3 condition.
Referent assignment There were significant main effects
of exposure and condition. 2/3 scores were significantly
higher than 0/3 and 1/3 scores combined and 3/3 scores were
significantly higher than the rest of the scores combined.
None of the interaction terms reached significance, indicating
that the amount of exposure to the language and greater coherence independently increased the ability to assign N and Q
words to the correct referents. We also computed this model
using coherence as a continuous variable; this continuous regressor significantly predicted increases in score, β = 0.29,
t(650) = 3.06, p < 0.005, indicating that parametrically increasing coherence resulted in parametric increases in referent assignment score.

herence, is sufficient to facilitate distributional learning. We
consider this possibility in Experiment 2.

Experiment 2: Phonological Coherence
As noted previously, Lany and Saffran (2010) found evidence
of successful MNPQ learning when co-occurrence regularities were perfectly correlated with a phonological property –
the number of syllables in an N/Q word. We sought to compare phonological coherence with semantic coherence. Thus,
in Experiment 2, we measured the result of a phonological
manipulation in which all M words began with “r” and all P
words began with “z”.

Method
Participants 157 MTurk workers participated in the study.
Design The method was similar to that of Experiment 1.
M’s were {rull, rudge, ruck} and P’s were {zof, zerm, zabe}.

Results and Discussion
Results are shown in Figure 4. We compared the phonological condition results with the 0/3 and 3/3 conditions of Experiment 1 using a regression model with Helmert contrasts
analyzing (i) the difference between the 0/3 and phonological
conditions and (ii) the difference between the 3/3 condition
and the 0/3 and phonological conditions combined.

To summarize, in Experiment 1, we found that higher coherence (1) increased ability to distinguish novel grammatical sentences from sentences violating co-occurrence regularities, (2) sharpened sensitivity to lexical category boundaries
related to the co-occurrence regularities, and (3) increased inductive bias in associating words with referents. How does
coherence bring about these effects? Frank & Gibson (2009)
have shown that MNPQ learning can be bolstered by easing
working memory demands. Furthermore, there is evidence
that novel words tax the memory system more, as they are
encoded in terms of smaller phonological units (Treiman &
Danis, 1988), so it is conceivable that the presence of semantically coherent known words reduced memory demands and
thus improved MNPQ learning. We tested for this possibility in our data using mediation analyses. In particular, we
tested whether memory scores mediated the effect of coherence on either (1) similarity scores or (2) referent assignment
scores. In both cases, we found partial mediation. After controlling for memory, the regression coefficient relating coherence and similarity decreased significantly from 0.28 to
0.12, Sobel z = 7.74, p < 0.05; this reduced value was significantly greater than zero, t(657) = 3.60, p < 0.0005, indicating partial mediation. After controlling for memory, the
regression coefficient relating coherence and referent assignment score decreased significantly from 0.31 to 0.19, Sobel z
= 5.19, p < 0.05; this reduced value was significantly greater
than zero, t(651) = 3.67, p < 0.0005, again indicating partial
mediation. Thus, improved memory can explain some, but
not all, of the increase in similarity and referent assignment
scores due to semantic coherence.

Memory Phonological scores were not significantly different from 0/3 scores, t(466) = 0.96, p > 0.05 and both combined were significantly lower than 3/3 scores, β = 0.2, t(466)
= 3.44, p < 0.001. Phonological efficiency was not significantly different from 0/3 efficiency, t(466) = -0.17, p > 0.05
and both combined were significantly lower than 3/3 efficiency, β = 0.0007, t(466) = 2.76, p < 0.01.
Similarity Phonological scores were not significantly different from 0/3 scores, t(466) = -0.16, p > 0.05, and both
combined were significantly lower than 3/3 scores, β = 0.14,
t(466) = 2.54, p < 0.05. Phonological efficiency was not
significantly different from 0/3 efficiency, t(466) = -0.29,
p > 0.05, and both combined were significantly lower than
3/3 efficiency, β = 0.0008, t(466) = 3.2, p < 0.005.
Referent assignment Phonological scores were not significantly different from 0/3 scores, t(466) = 1.47, p > 0.05,
and both combined were significantly less than 3/3 scores,
β = 0.2, t(466) = 2.35, p < 0.05. There were no differences
in efficiency (recall that this was also the case in Experiment 1). In terms of facilitating acquisition of the MN and
PQ co-occurrence regularities, the phonological manipulation was indistinguishable from the 0/3 condition, and hence
was markedly less effective than semantic coherence at the
3/3 level. It must be noted that the phonological regularity we introduced was the onset consonant (r- words versus
z- words) applied to M/P words, whereas Lany and Saffran
(2010) used syllable length (monosyllabic versus disyllabic
words) applied to N/Q words, making direct comparison difficult. Presently, we have established that a particular kind

Given this result, it is natural to ask whether known words
per se can sufficiently ease memory demands so as to facilitate MNPQ learning, or whether they must have semantic
coherence; we consider this question in Experiment 3. A different, though not mutually exclusive, possibility is that any
relatively salient type of coherence, such as phonological co-

Results and Discussion

of phonological regularity (onset consonant of a co-occurring
word) is a far weaker correlated cue than semantic coherence.

Memory Incoherent scores were not significantly different
from 0/3 scores, t(460) = 0.056, p > 0.05 and both combined
were significantly lower than 3/3 scores, β = 0.23, t(460) =
3.95, p < 0.0001. Incoherent efficiency was not significantly
different from 0/3 efficiency, t(460) = 0.25, p > 0.05 and both
combined were significantly lower than 3/3 efficiency, β =
0.0006, t(460) = 2.55, p < 0.05.

Experiment 3: Semantic Incoherence
The M and P words in Experiment 1 were all known and had
semantic coherence. In Experiment 3, we explored whether
coherence is necessary for facilitation of distributional learning, or whether the mere presence of known words is sufficient – that is, whether a semantically incoherent language
facilitates distributional learning.

Similarity Incoherent scores were not significantly different from 0/3 scores, t(460) = -0.22, p > 0.05, and both combined were significantly lower than 3/3 scores, β = 0.15,
t(460) = 2.47, p < 0.05. Incoherent efficiency was not significantly different from 0/3 efficiency, t(460) = 0.723, p > 0.05,
and both combined were significantly lower than 3/3 efficiency, β = 0.0006, t(460) = 2.54, p < 0.05.

Method
Participants 151 MTurk workers participated in the study.
Design and Procedure The method was similar to that of
Experiment 2. The M and P words were known but did not
adhere to any clear semantic organization. The specific M and
P words were drawn from the pool {shelf, glove, rain, leash,
card, ball}. In the referent assignment task, these known
words were paired with images of the obvious referents, e.g.,
card with a picture of card.

Referent assignment Incoherent scores were not significantly different from 0/3 scores, t(460) = 0.82, p > 0.05,
and both combined were significantly less than 3/3 scores,
β = 0.23, t(460) = 2.83, p < 0.01. There were no differences
in efficiency (recall that this was also the case in Experiments
1 and 2). The familiar but semantically incoherent linguistic

825

input appeared to have provided no benefit compared to the
novel words of the 0/3 condition, suggesting that the presence
of known words by itself does not aid distributional learning.

General discussion
We have conducted the first large-scale systematic investigation of the effects of exposure and various correlated cues (semantic and phonological coherence) on distributional learning of word meanings. We have shown that semantic coherence aids distributional learning in the MNPQ regime far
more than phonological (onset consonant) coherence. Additionally, our experiments indicate that coherence is necessary
– semantically incoherent linguistic input provided virtually
no benefit. Additionally, we showed that coherence works in
part by alleviating memory limitations, though our data suggests that there may be aspects of distributional word learning
not bottlenecked by memory resources.
We conjecture that word learners may be using semantic
coherence to infer the topic of discourse and that this gist
topic meaning influences the representations of co-occurring
novel words (cf. the topic-learning models of Griffiths,
Steyvers, & Tenenbaum, 2007). It may be through this process that people know tort to be a legal term and transducer
to be an engineering term, despite not knowing the precise
meanings of these words. Under this account, learning would
be easier for words that occur in contexts high in semantic information and coherence. Thus, we would expect learning to
have a “contiguous” character (faster learning for words occurring in familiar contexts than for words occurring in less
familiar contexts), a possibility we plan to test in future work.
Our experiments highlight a limitation of artificial language learning paradigms. Researchers using entirely artificial languages may be severely limiting the power of distributional learning mechanisms, which our experiments show
to be greatly enhanced by the presence of known words that
adhere to some semantic organization.
Our work on distributional learning of semantic properties is in agreement with the extant literature on distributional
learning of syntactic properties (viz. grammatical gender).
Results from these studies (e.g., Brooks et al., 1993; Frigo
& McDonald, 1998) indicate that children and adults fail to
learn MNPQ categories without correlated cues, but they can
learn given (e.g.,) correlated phonological markers. We believe that correlated cues – be they semantic, phonological,
or otherwise – serve a common purpose: to reduce the space
of possible categories.
