     Each example was identically worded but accompanied
by linear, circular, or no gestures. For the linear condition,
the experimenter made 4 discrete slicing gestures right to
left for the 4 stages in the spoken text. For the circular
condition, the experimenter made 4 pointing gestures at 12,
9, 6, and 3 o’clock for the 4 stages in the spoken text. The
right-to-left and counter-clockwise directions were from the
experimenter’s point of view so compatible with the
subject’s perspective. For the no-gesture group, the
experimenter kept her hands in pockets.

Discussion
Gestures had powerful effects on people’s diagrams of
events in time. People were asked to diagram a cyclical
sequence of four events. Without gestures, a majority of
participants drew linear diagrams. However, with circular
gestures, a majority drew circular diagrams. If the way
people diagram reflects the way they think, and there is
considerable evidence for this (e. g., Tversky, 2011;
Tversky, et al., 2002), then we can conclude that gestures
affect the way people think about temporal events.
However, it could be argued that participants copied the
diagram the experimenter drew in the air. The next study
obviates that objection by asking participants to make
inferences.                                                         Figure 4: Proportion of linear and circular answers for each
