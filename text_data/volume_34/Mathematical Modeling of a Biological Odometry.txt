                  2.1 Egocentric Models
  For path integration in egocentric models, two velocities
are measured, the forward (translational) velocity, v, and the
angular velocity, ω (Figure 1). Egocentric related
differential equations formulated by Banhamou and
Séguinot (1995) are obtained considering small time steps.
In the polar coordinates they are,

As in the experiment above, we model movement along
isosceles triangles with 20 units and five different rotation
angles between equal sides of a triangle. After passing one
side of a triangle and reaching the first goal, the agent
rotates and crosses the second side to reach the second goal
