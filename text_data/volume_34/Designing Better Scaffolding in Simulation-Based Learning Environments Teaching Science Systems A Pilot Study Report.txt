sciences and humanities fields, and didn’t have strong
background in science. One case was dropped because the
participant totally misunderstood the learning goals and
didn’t complete the posttest. Another pilot study earlier
showed that reasoning across different levels of a complex
system and scientific reasoning about causality was difficult
even for this population, and that was why we conducted a
pilot study in this population before designing the
