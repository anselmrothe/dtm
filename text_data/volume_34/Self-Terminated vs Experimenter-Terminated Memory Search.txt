the number of items retrieved between the closed- (M=5.11)

retrieval did not impact recall rates. Analyses of intrusion

The average number of intrusions did not differ as a

intra-list false alarms, or items that were incorrectly output
that occurred on previous lists (t(48)=1.642, p>0.10,
BF=2.47). Also, intrusion rates did not change as a function
of time spent in the experiment (p>0.47, but see Unsworth
et al., 2011). Given these results, we are comfortable
concluding that the open-interval design does not differ
from the closed-interval design in terms of number and type
recalled.
