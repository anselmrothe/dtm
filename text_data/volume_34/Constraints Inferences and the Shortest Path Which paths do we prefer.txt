Participants would then simply sketch the tour that
corresponds to their mental model. In case of determinate
problems this would lead to identical performance (with
respect to error rate) between the types of reasoning
problems      (D-optimal/D-suboptimal).       In    case    of
indeterminate reasoning problems, we expect that
participants will select the preferred mental model,
regardless of whether or not the according path was optimal
or suboptimal (IP-optimal/IP-suboptimal). Second, the
external representation influences the mental model, as the
task of sketching a round trip for the shopping route
implicitly requires choosing a short solution. In this case,
we expect interferences between finding the correct solution
to the reasoning problem and planning the shortest path.
Such an interference would have a selective impact on
performance for determinate reasoning problems of type D-
suboptimal, for which the shortest (optimal) path and the
correct solution to the reasoning problem were different, but
not for determinate reasoning problems of type D-optimal,
for which the optimal path and the correct solution to the
reasoning problem were identical. The predictions for
indeterminate problems are not as straight forward, as each
indeterminate problem features three different solutions.
