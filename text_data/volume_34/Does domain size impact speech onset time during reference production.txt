                           Abstract
   In referring to a target referent, speakers need to choose
   a set of properties that jointly distinguish it from its
   distractors. Current computational models view this as
   a search process in which the decision to include a prop-
   erty requires checking how many distractors it excludes.
   Thus, these models predict that identifying descriptions
   should take longer to produce the larger the distractor
   set is, independent of how many properties are required
   to identify a target. Since every property that is selected
   is checked, they also predict that distinguishing a tar-
   get should take longer the more properties are required
   to distinguish it. This paper tests this prediction em-
   pirically, contrasting it with two alternative predictions                     Figure 1: An example domain

Participants did the experiment individually in a sound-
proof booth, wearing a headset through which their de-
scriptions were recorded. The experiment was run using
the DMDX package for stimulus presentation (Forster &
Forster, 2003). They were asked to imagine that they
were describing objects for a listener who could see the
exact same objects but did not know which one was the
target referent. In order to avoid the use of descrip-
tions containing locative expressions, participants were
also told that their putative listener would see the ob-
jects in different positions (none of the participants used
locatives).
   A trial was initiated with a warning bell and a fixation
cross appearing for 500ms in the middle of the screen.
Subsequently, the visual domain appeared. After they
had described the target, participants pressed the Enter
key on their keyboard to move to the next trial.
   Trials were presented in two blocks to allow partici-
pants to take a break. Speech onset time was measured
