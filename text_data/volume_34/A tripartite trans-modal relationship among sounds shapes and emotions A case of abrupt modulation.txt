autonomy of semantics (meanings) from sounds. One of the
Saussurian principles of languages suggests that there is no
inherent connection between meanings and sounds. For
example, there is no inherent reason why what we call
[khæt] is called in such a way. In fact, different languages
call that animal by different names. Therefore, the argument
goes, the sound-meaning relationship must be arbitrary.
Saussure in fact raises this principle of arbitrariness as a first
principle of natural languages (de Saussure, 1960).

final experiment goes beyond the traditional sound
symbolism studies and shows that there is a direct
connection between the emotion types with abrupt onsets
and angular shapes. The last two experiments were
motivated by a recent finding with Japanese speakers that
particular types of emotions can be associated with
particular sounds and shapes (Shinohara et al., 2011).
Overall, our experiments show a tripartite relationship
between three domains of cognition (auditory sounds, visual
shapes, and emotion types). The overall conclusion and the
roadmap of this paper are illustrated in Figure 1.
 Background: Phonetics of stops and sonorants
Oral stops are those sounds that are made with complete
oral occlusion (and without the leakage of air through the
nasal cavity), which results in rise of the intraoral air
pressure (Ohala, 1983). The acoustic consequence of the
rise in intraoral air pressure, upon the release of the stop
occlusion, is abrupt bursts. Stop consonants thus involve a
burst with abrupt amplitude changes after the release of the
oral closure. Figure 2 shows a waveform of the 0.05 sec
(=50 ms) interval centering around a stop burst of [t]. It
represents amplitude changes on the y-axis across time on
the x-axis. The transition from a closure phase (oral
occlusion) into a burst is rather abrupt, and the burst itself
involves abrupt amplitude changes.

Participants Seventeen native speakers of English
participated in the experiment in a sound attenuated room.
They were all undergraduate students at Rutgers University,
and received extra credit for linguistics classes.
Statistics Since the responses were categorical (angular or
not), a logistic linear mixed model regression was run in
which the dependent variable was the angular response and
the independent variables were the difference between stops
and sonorants as a fixed factor and subject as a random
factor. All statistical analyses in this paper were performed
using R.
