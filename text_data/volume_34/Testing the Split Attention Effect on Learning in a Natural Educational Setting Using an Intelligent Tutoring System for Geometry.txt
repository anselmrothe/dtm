Butcher and Aleven (2008) conducted an in vivo experiment
where they contrasted classroom learning from two different
versions of Cognitive Tutor: Geometry. The traditional
interface included a verbal statement of the given
information, a diagram, and a table. The table was the focus
of the student interactions and required students to enter the
measure of each angle, as well as a reason justifying the
calculation. For the experimental interface, all of the inputs
were made directly in the diagram. Students entered their
measures and reasons by clicking on angles in the diagram.
The learning results from that study suggested that the
interactive diagram was easier to learn from, especially in
terms of a delayed posttest for numerical test items.
