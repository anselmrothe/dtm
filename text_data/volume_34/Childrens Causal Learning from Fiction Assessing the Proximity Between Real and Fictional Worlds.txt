In the current research, we explore children’s causal
inferences about fictional content and examine whether
contextual information influences their subsequent
generalization of novel causal properties to the real world.
In particular, we examine whether the likelihood that
children will generalize novel causal information varies
based upon the perceived proximity of the fictional world
(with far worlds generating a lower probability of
generalization than close worlds), and whether sensitivity to
the proximity of the fictional world changes over the course
of development.
