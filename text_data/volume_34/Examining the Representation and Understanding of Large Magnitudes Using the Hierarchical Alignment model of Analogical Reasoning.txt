Measures All students completed outcome measures one
month after the stratigraphy lab as part of a laboratory exam.
There were two items that assessed understanding of
geologic time magnitude. One item came from the
Geoscience Concept Inventory, which is a valid and reliable
instrument measuring a range of geoscience concept
knowledge (Libarkin, et al., 2005). For this item, students
were presented with five time lines that had the same
geologic events in different locations. Four of the time lines
represented common misconceptions students have

they are wrong on the scale of billions of years).
   The second item is a new measure of geologic time
developed for use with middle school students (Barghaus &
Porter, 2010). This item is a multiple-choice item that
required students to identify which duration-based statement
was true using a conventional diagram of the Geologic Time
Scale. The correct choice is the statement: The Proterozoic
Eon lasted much longer than the Phanerozoic Eon. While
numerical information is provided in the diagram, the
correct choice may not be obvious to novices in the standard
diagram because the spatial intervals of the eons do not
proportionally correspond to their temporal lengths. This
type of compressed representation is how the Geologic
Time Scale is typically depicted. In past work the most
commonly chosen incorrect response was a statement that is             Figure 3: Percentage of students making large-magnitude
