   Q2: Is a tutee’s shallow learning detrimental to tutor
learning? We hypothesize that letting SimStudents do shal-
low learning is harmful for tutor learning. To test this hy-
pothesis, we will validate the production rules of SimStu-
dents who passed the fixed Quiz to see if they can also pass
the randomly generated Quiz. We will then examine if stu-
dents who allowed their SimStudents to commit to shallow
learning showed poor learning.
   Q3: How do tutee errors influence tutor learning? We
hypothesize that the effect of learning from erroneous ex-
amples would apply for tutor learning, that is, detecting
SimStudent’s errors correctly and explaining those errors
would facilitate tutor learning.
