Procedure
The experimenter introduced the machine, explaining that
some things make the machine play music and some things
do not. The child was then instructed to sort the blocks into
two piles according to whether they activated the machine.
    The experimenter placed each of the eight blocks on the
machine, one at a time. After children observed each
outcome, they were asked for a verbal response. In the
explain condition, children were asked to explain the
outcome: “Why did/didn’t this block make my machine play
music?” In the control condition, children were asked to
describe the outcome: “What happened to my machine
when I put this block on it? Did it make music?” The order
of presentation of the eight blocks was semi-random (see
Figure 1A). All blocks remained visible and were grouped
on the table throughout the training and test phases of the                 Figure 1: Procedure for Studies 1 (A) and 2 (B).
