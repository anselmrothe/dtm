   Figure 1d shows how higher level concepts can be built
upon the atomic operators of appear, persist and disappear
– if something alternately appears and disappears over time,
the concept of “blinking” can be used to encapsulate the
process. The higher level concepts are firmly grounded
through the atomic operational representations.             This
process is termed “cognitive hierarchy construction.”
   Figure 1e shows how the atomic operators can be
recombined into novel sequences that may not have been
encountered in the environment earlier in a generation
process through the conceptual hierarchy, directed by
reasoning and problem solving requirements. This
characteristic is referred to as “cognitive manipulatability” –
i.e., these representations can be directly manipulated in
cognitive processes.
   Base on the foregoing discussion, the critical
characteristics of operational representations in general and
atomic operational representations in particular are
summarized as follows:                                              Figure 2: Operational representations of movements. a. Up

operational representations. Figure 5a shows a situation in a
one dimensional world in which 2 objects hit each other and
are reflected. The concepts of “meet”, “part” and “reflect”
can arise in this situation as shown in Figure 5a and be
encoded in the form of operational representations. Figure
