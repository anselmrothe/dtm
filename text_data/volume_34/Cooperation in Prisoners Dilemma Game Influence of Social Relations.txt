   After each game the subjects got feedback about their own

They could also constantly monitor their own total payoff; the
total payoff of the other player; the total payoff for the pair,
and the monetary equivalent of the total payoff of the pair
(that is to be distributed among them).
   Participants were instructed to try to maximize the amount
of money they will get. Subjects were paid real money
accordingly to the final payoff in the game. Players in the
unity condition received the same amount of money for
1000 points as participants in the other 3 conditions received
for 500 points. Thus we tried to equate the absolute                 Figure 3: Average percentage of cooperative choices in each
