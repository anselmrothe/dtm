Shift pattern of predictions of each student
What was the qualitative trajectory of this successful
conceptual shift in the whole class? In terms of choices of
alternatives of the experiment results and the similarities of
explanations given by the children, did the class converge to
the “same” answer, or did the individual students diverge?
   Each student could choose one of three possible
predictions for each problem. This allowed many possible
paths of choices, but for 7 of the 11 problems, more than
half of the students chose the same prediction (Fig. 1). If         Figure 3: Number of utterances during discussion for each
