   Whereas imitators need creators, creators should ignore
others if they could do better on their own (p = 1). In other
words, the fitness prospects of creators working alone can be
viewed in a manner analogous to the interest yield of treasury
bonds in investment decisions. This logic suggests another
kind of modification of the standard discounting method. The

to as Present Innovation Value (PIV) discounting. Let Ft
be the mean action fitness at period t for parameter setting
{C, p}. Note that Ft1,1 is the fitness expectation with no in-
teraction amongst agents. We define the PIV for any fitness
curve as:
                                        N
                                           F C,p
                 PIV (F C,p ) = −N + ∑ 1,1                    (3)
                                       t=1 F
   Therefore, PIV (F 1,1 ) = 0; creators are indifferent to work-
ing alone or in a community with imitation.
