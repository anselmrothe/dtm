randomly-selected Hungarian word was presented for 2000
ms., and after a 1000 ms. interstimulus interval, the
corresponding English word was presented for 2000 ms.
This study used a within-participants design; thus, for each
experimental session, three Hungarian words and their
English glosses were assigned at random to each of the
following conditions: (1), iconic gesture, in which words
were accompanied by video of a gesture representing their
meaning; (2), beat gesture, in which words were
accompanied by video of simple, non-iconic gestures made
in time to speech; (3), image, in which words were
accompanied by an image representing their meaning; (4),
text, in which words were presented as text (see Materials

embodied action. One possible reason why iconic gesture
may not have produced the facilitatory effect observed in
other similar studies of L2 word learning is that participants
may have encountered difficulties mapping gestures onto
the words that they were intended to represent. Despite the
care that was taken in selecting gestures to represent target
words based on gesture production data from the norming
study, it is possible that the gestures chosen may logically
map onto the meanings of more than one word (e.g., the
gesture representing to climb may also map onto ladder).
Unclear gesture-word mappings such as these may cause
confusion, unnecessarily increasing cognitive load upon
presentation of “correct” English glosses, which in turn may
negatively impact L2 word learning and recall. Experiment
3 attempted to control for gesture-meaning mismatches by
presenting English glosses prior to Hungarian words, in
order to ensure that iconic gestures were immediately
associated with their intended meanings.                              Figure 3: Percent of word meanings recalled by condition

may be enhanced via enactment of iconic gestures and
visualization of mental imagery, even though word learning
was not facilitated via passive viewing of iconic gestures
and physical images. Experiment 4 tested this possibility by
examining the effectiveness of L2 word learning via the
active equivalents of the learning conditions of Studies 1-3.

Twenty-eight undergraduates (Age: M = 20.67; SD = 1.56;
Sex: 12 males; 16 females) at a medium-sized public

no knowledge of Hungarian. Additionally, participants had
not participated in Experiments 1, 2, or 3.
   As in Experiments 1-3, the learning phase of Experiment
