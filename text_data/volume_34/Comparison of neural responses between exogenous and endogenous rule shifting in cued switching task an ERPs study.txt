Behavioral data
We measured mean reaction times (RTs) and calculated
switching costs (RT during trials in which the response rule
switches minus RT during trials in which the response rule is
maintained) for all conditions (see Figure 3). For RT data,
the ANOVA revealed only one significant main effect,
which was of switching, F (1, 11) = 35.25, p < .001. RTs in
trials when the response rule was switched were
significantly larger than RTs in trials when the response rule
was maintained. A t-test on the switching cost results
revealed no significant differences between the exogenous
and endogenous switching conditions, T (11) = -0.76, p = .46.
