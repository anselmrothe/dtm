and their unequal length informed by the data pattern over
the 39 trial numbers. As the conclusions derived from the
two statistical analyses were congruent, we reported only
the results of the latter which offered a finer tracking of the
dynamics of verbal satiation. Because of space limitation,
only data for Yes responses are presented. Data for No
responses were congruent with the ones from Yes
responses.
                        Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we aimed at eliciting verbal satiation
through 20 repetitive access to a Chinese category name’s
word form and meaning.
   According to three accounts of satiation (associative
satiation, semantic satiation, and orthographic satiation),
Experiment 1 should elicit verbal satiation. Repetitive
access from the same word form to the same meaning unit
should satiate the associative link between orthographic and
semantic units. Accessing repetitively the meaning of the
category name should satiate it. Repetitive access to the
same word form should elicit orthographic satiation.
Method
Forty students (female 33) participated in the experiment.
The subjects ran a category-matching task as described in
the General Method section.
Results and Discussion
   One participant out of 40 was excluded based on a 90%
accuracy criterion. Figure 1 plots the time course of the RTs
for the correct Yes responses as a function of the trial
number. Both baseline and repeated trials showed a slowing
trend which revealed a general fatigue effect.

  Experiment 1 asked the subjects to determine if an
exemplar word matched a category word. In terms of YES
responses, response times for the first 11 repeated trials
were similar to RTs for the non-repeated baseline trials.
After that, RTs for the repeated trials became slower than
RTs for the baseline trials. The increased RT difference
between the repeated and the baseline trials from position 1
to position 2 was about 9 ms. Not due to a speed-accuracy
tradeoff, this difference represented a verbal satiation effect
brought about by the repeated processing of the same
category word.

towards the occurrence of verbal satiation at Position 2.
  In Experiment 2, the main result was that repeated
processing of exemplars of a same category increased the
RTs differences between repeated trials and baseline trials.
We posited that these RTs differences signaled the
occurrence of verbal satiation. Verbal satiation occurred
roughly at the same trial number than in Experiment 1.
Unlike the verbal satiation in Experiment 1, verbal satiation
in Experiment 2 was short-lived (limited to trials 13-17) and
of higher magnitude (20 ms versus 9 ms). The verbal
satiation in Experiment 2 must be purely semantic because
the word form of the dominant category name was never
shown and the cues in repeated trials had all a different
word form. Hence, with Experiment 2, we identified a
semantic locus to verbal satiation which could have                    Figure 4. Experiment 3. Reaction times as a function of trial
