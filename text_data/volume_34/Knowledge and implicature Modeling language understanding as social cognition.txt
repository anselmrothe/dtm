   pret an utterance by using Bayesian inference to “invert” this
   model of the speaker. We apply this framework to model scalar
   implicature (“some” implies “not all”, and “N” implies “not
   more than N”). This model predicts an interaction between the
   speaker’s knowledge state and the listener’s interpretation. We
   test these predictions in two experiments, and find good fit be-
   tween model predictions and human judgements. Keywords:
