children to utilize labels as windows into categories and
reliably use this information in the course of induction.
   One possibility is that advances in category-based
reasoning are facilitated by changes in how children
organize knowledge. There is evidence that children begin
to organize concepts into networks by 21 months (Arias-
Trejo & Plunkett, 2009). There is also evidence that
conceptual organization changes over the course of
development, with associative networks emerging prior to
semantic networks (McCauley, Weil, & Sperber, 1976;
Plaut & Booth, 2000). It is also possible that development of
executive functioning may facilitate category-based
reasoning by allowing children to disengage their attention
from – often misleading or irrelevant – surface similarities
and consider deeper relational similarities (Sloutsky &
Fisher, 2005; Sloutsky, 2010).
   The goal of the present research is to examine possible
cognitive factors contributing to the development of
category-based reasoning. Towards this goal we designed a

approach. Specifically, we collected measures of children’s             Figure 1: Schematic depiction of the category-based

   The semantic space task was included in the assessment
battery to assess whether the organization of children’s
semantic space was related to their performance on the
category-based reasoning task. Specifically, we were
interested in identifying how children weight different
dimensions (e.g., semantic-similarity, physical similarity,
and habitat) and whether the distribution of weights to
various dimensions enhances or hinders children’s ability to
successfully make category-based inductions.
