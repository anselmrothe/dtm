   Kojima, Ito, and Matsui (2008) investigated whether
emphasizing the goal state could facilitate insight problem
solving using the F puzzle. The F puzzle is to arrange the
four pieces so as to make the F-shape. Along with the T-
puzzle, the goal state is essentially included and is explicitly
shown in the original task instruction. In order to emphasize
the goal state, they provided the F-shape template with the
participants and asked them to match the pieces to it. In
addition to the template condition, they introduced the
instruction condition, in which the participants were not
provided any external aid and were required only to imagine
the F-shape. The results showed that the solution rate in the
template condition was higher than those in the instruction
condition and in the control condition. Kojima et al. (2008)
concluded that giving the template was effective in
emphasizing the goal state and facilitating the top-down
processing and that the top-down processing can be
effective in insight problem solving.
   Because these studies used the insight problem having a
fixed goal, the participants had to reach it. However some
insight problems, for example, the 6-coin problem, have
more than one goal states. What roles does goal information
play in solving the multi goal states problem? Chronicle,
MacGregor, and Ormerod (2004) addressed the question
using the 6-coin problem. They showed that the participants
could reach the solution more often when they were given
the visualized goal state than when were given only the
original instruction.
Purpose of the Present Study
Previous studies have shown that emphasizing the goal state
could facilitate insight problem solving. In the previous
studies, the information of the goal states were given by the
experimenters and the participants were instructed to reach
the goal state. In the present study, we investigate whether
or not the same facilitative effect can be obtained when the
participants are asked to find the goal state by themselves
before performing the tasks. If emphasizing the goal state
facilitated insight problem solving, we expected that self
goal setting could be effective in insight problem solving as
long as they set the goal state appropriately.

to slide one coin only. (c) When they slide a coin, it must
not disturb any other coins. (d) At the end of each move, the
moved coin must be touching two other coins. There could
be the following two goal states: ring and 2-group.
According to Chronicle et al. (2004), there are only two
paths to the ring goal state and 176 to the 2-group one. An
example solution path to the former goal state is shown in
Figure 2 and the latter in Figure 3.
Procedures Participants were tested individually and their
solution attempts were videotaped. For both conditions,
participants were shown the initial state of the problem
using 6 Japanese 500-yen coins. The participants in the self
goal setting condition were asked to draw the goal state on a
paper in three minutes and then to reach the goal state in 12
minutes. They were allowed only to reach the goal state
they drew. The participants in the control condition were
asked only to solve the problem in 15 minutes. The

   Another reason why those in the self goal setting
condition could not solve the problem might be because it is
more difficult to find any paths to the ring goal than the 2-
group goal. Chronicle at al. (2004) have shown that there
were only 2 routes to the ring goal whereas 176 to the 2-
group goal. Thus, it was more difficult for those who could
draw the ring goal state to find the routes to it.
                       Experiment 2
Contrary to our expectation, in Experiment 1, self goal
setting could not facilitate but disrupt the insight problem
solving. Because some participants set the inappropriate
goals and they were not allowed to change them, the
situation might have negative effects on insight problem
solving. If the inappropriate goal setting is cause of the
disruptive effects, the disruptive effect will be diminished
when the participants can change the goal state. In
Experiment 2, we examine the effects of self goal setting on
insight problem solving when the participants are allowed to
change the goal state.
