   Stimuli
   Eight animals of the same type were used in each trial: 8
bears, 8 swans, 8 mice etc. In the first measurement 6
animals were presented, divided in two sets of three animals
of the same type – one set of 3 animals for the experimenter
and one for the child. There was a big, medium and small
animal in each set. The corresponding objects from the two
sets were of different absolute sizes - for example the
biggest mouse from the experimenter’s set and the biggest
mouse from the child’s set had different sizes. In the second
measurement a fourth animal of the same type was added to
each set. In addition, in the Analogy condition six draw-bars
were used to connect the wagons of the train – three for the
experimenter’s set and three for the child’s set (Figure 1a
and 1b, correspondingly).
