In this sequence of utterances, two seemingly unrelated
items were mentioned by the speaker and the hearer is
expected to reason how on earth they are connected. The
process of mentally searching for the connection and
discovering it finally on the basis of the rationale provided
by the speaker yield humorous effects. The sequence has
four distinctive phases: the 1st phase introduces the target
concept (“Given A”); the 2nd phase introduces the response
concept (“I’d say B”); the 3rd phase asks the hearer if he
knows the rationale for making connection between the two
concepts (“Do you know why?”); and the 4th phase
provides the rationale for the supposed connection (“It is
because X”). In this functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) study, we presented a set of such sequences to
participants, and then asked them to judge whether or not
the given riddles are humorous after they heard the rationale.

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to investigate the
neuropsychological process and timing of appreciating humor
upon reading a set of Japanese riddles which were made up of
4 distinct phases: “Given A (1st phase), I'd say B (2nd phase).
Do you know why? (3rd phase) It is because X (4th phase).”
To investigate how the brain responds when an individual
finds the answer to the riddle (“It is because X”) humorous,
this study used the fMRI method. We found that when a
participant judged the answer to the riddle humorous, the
bilateral amygdalae had been significantly activated at the 4th
phase. When the participant judged the answer to the riddle
banal (non-humorous), by contrast, the left amygdala was
found to be significantly activated earlier at the 3rd phase.
Therefore, we argue that in both cases, activation of the
amygdala is related to the detection of optimal relevance.

Incongruity resolution in humor appreciation

Introduction

According to a standard humor appreciation model (Suls,
1972; Wyer & Collins, 1992; Yus, 2003; Martin, 2006),
incongruities in the content of the utterance must be
identified and resolved for it to be humorous. The
incongruities are typically caused by violation of a set of
expectations stored in “mental schemas” which are “formed
on the basis of past experience with objects, scenes, or
events and consists of a set of (usually unconscious)
expectations about what things look like and/or the order in
which they occur” (Mandler, 1979, p. 263). Thus, in humor
appreciation, the simultaneous activation of two
incompatible schemas is essential (Wyer & Collins, 1992).

Timing control is essential for a type of Japanese riddle in
the following example, which has the fixed form of “Given
A (target word), I’d say B (response word). Do you know
why? (question) It is because X (answer)” (“A to kakete, B
to toku, sono kokoro wa, X.”).
“Given ‘the savings,’ I’d say ‘a smile of my wife’. Do you
know why? It is because if they disappear, I will be in
trouble.”

In the Japanese riddle, it is structurally controlled. During
the 1st and the 2nd phase, two different schemas
corresponding to a target word and a response word are
likely to be activated. Two incompatible schemas are
simultaneously activated between the 2nd and the 4th phase.
When incongruities between these schemas are noticed, the
hearer of the riddle naturally looks for a novel and
interesting way to resolve them. When a rationale for
connecting the two seemingly unrelated concepts is
provided at the 4th phase, the incongruities get resolved. At
that point, the two existing incompatible schemas and a new
schema corresponding to the rationale given are likely to be
activated simultaneously. The success of the humor relies
upon this resolution being inaccessible before it is given, yet
obvious with hindsight when given. If either the resolution
fails to be logically coherent or is instead too obvious, the
riddle is judged banal.
According to Relevance Theory (Matsui, 2000; Sperber &
Wilson, 1995; Yus, 2003; Utsumi, 2005), the motivation for
appreciating humor comes from search for “relevance,”
which is a property of inputs to cognitive processes and is
determined by the balance between the cognitive effect and
processing effort. An input has cognitive effect if it
significantly improves a cognitive environment of an
individual. In order to process the input, though, some
processing effort is required. Relevance Theory has two
fundamental principles. The first, or the cognitive principle
of relevance, states that “human cognition tends to be
geared to the maximization of relevance.” The second, or
the communicative principle of relevance, states that “every
act of ostensive communication communicates a
presumption of its own optimal relevance” (Sperber &
Wilson, 1995, p. 260). The first principle of relevance
predicts that an individual has an innate tendency to process
an input to yield maximum cognitive effect with least
possible processing effort. The second principle predicts
that as a hearer, an individual automatically expects that the
speaker will provide information which yields enough
cognitive effect in return for the processing cost.
A relevance-theoretic view of interpretation of the
Japanese riddles is based on the second principle. When
encountering the Japanese riddles, an individual, who
expects that it would provide enough cognitive effect with
least possible processing effort, automatically tries to
resolve the incongruities between the two seemingly
unrelated schemas corresponding to the target and the
response words. When the individual is finally given the
rationale for connecting the two unrelated concepts at the
4th phase, he is likely to feel “Aha!” At that point, he is
satisfied with the interpretation and stops processing it.
Based on this principle, it was predicted that, if the
answer to the riddle was finally judged humorous, there
would be little relevance-based understanding in the 3rd
phase because no cognitive effect was yet achieved at that
time point, and the intensity of relevance-based
understanding would go up in the 4th phase because enough
cognitive effect was finally achieved then to repay the large

processing effort spent during the 3rd phase. It was also
predicted that, if a riddle was finally judged banal (nonhumorous), relevance-based understanding would peak at
the 3rd phase since the individual already found a rationale
satisfying optimal relevance. Since the riddle was in this
case resolved already by the 3rd phase, it was predicted that
there would be no further relevance-based understanding in
the 4th phase.

The amygdala as a detector of optimal relevance
Previous lesion and neuroimaging studies have shown that
the amygdala is involved in an evaluation of motivationally
relevant events (Sander, Grafman, & Zalla, 2003; Zald,
2003; Bach et al., 2008). Several studies have demonstrated
the key role of the amygdala in negative emotion, but a few
studies have suggested a corresponding role for the
amygdala in both positive and negative emotion (Hamann &
Mao, 2002; Burgdorf & Panksepp, 2006). So, the view of
the amygdala as a relevance detector has been proposed
(Sander et al., 2003; Zald, 2003), and many neuroimaging
studies have supported the hypothesis (Bach et al., 2008;
Ousdal et al, 2008; Herbert et al., 2009; Bach et al., 2011).
In this article, we take the hypothesis a step further and
propose that the amygdala extends its function in humans as
a relevance detector in ostensive communication. Thus, it
was predicted that the amygdala would be activated if
relevance-based understanding occurred. It was also
predicted that the amygdala would be deactivated if no such
relevance-based processing occurred.
Previous neuroimaging humor studies report the
activation of subcortical structures including the amygdalae
during humor appreciation (Mobbs, Greicius, Adbel-Azim,
Menon, & Reiss, 2003; Moran, Wig, Adams, Janata, &
Kelley, 2004; Bartolo, Benuzzi, Nocetti, Baraldi, & Nichelli,
2006; Wild, Rodden et al., 2006; Watson, Matthews, &
Allman, 2007; Bekinschtein, Davis, Rodd, & Owen, 2011;
Kohn, Kellermann, Gur, Schneider, & Habel, 2011). We
propose that activation of amygdala in humor appreciation
can be interpreted as the result of detecting the optimal
relevance in humorous utterances –– the “Aha” reaction.
Other main common activation areas of these humor studies
include the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex: an area
around the left fusiform gyrus or the left temporo-occipital
junction (Brodmann’s area [BA] 37) ) to detect incongruity
in humorous utterances (Mobbs et al., 2003); the left
posterior middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) for semantic
comprehension of humor (Moran et al., 2004); the left
inferior frontal gyrus including Broca’s area (BA 44/45) to
resolve the incongruity or ambiguity in humorous utterances
(Mobbs et al., 2003; Moran et al., 2004; Bekinschtein et al.,
2011); and the medial frontal cortex (Goel & Dolan, 2001;
Mobbs et al., 2003; Kohn et al., 2011).
In this study, we used the fMRI method to investigate the
relationship between humor appreciation and its time course
that composed two factors: the presence/absence of humor
(humorous vs. non-humorous) and the expecting/shown
rationale (the 3rd phase vs. the 4th phase). We predicted that

798

when a participant explicitly judged the answer to the riddle
humorous at the end, its relevance would be detected
implicitly at the 4th phase. In addition, it was predicted that
when the participant judged the answer to the riddle nonhumorous at the end because it was banal, its relevance
would be detected earlier at the 3rd phase.

were projected onto a half-transparent viewing screen
located behind the head coil of the magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scanner. Participants viewed the stimuli via
a mirror attached to the head coil. The sentence stimuli were
written in Japanese and presented with white letters on a
black background. The maximum visual angle was 7.8°
(horizontal) × 0.9° (vertical).
In each trial, the 1st phase was presented on the screen for
1.5 sec followed by a cross-hair for 1.25 sec, then the 2nd
phase appeared for 2 sec followed by a cross-hair for 1.25
sec, then the 3rd phase appeared for 0.75 sec followed by a
cross-hair for 1.75 sec, after that the 4th phase was
presented for 3.5 sec followed by a cross-hair for 2 sec. The
length of each phase was adjusted corresponding to the max
length of presented stimuli because timing control was
important for the Japanese riddles, yet the length of the 3rd
phase was shortened and the time between the 3rd and the
4th phase was lengthened because of reducing the value of
correlation coefficients of regressors in imaging data
analyses. Then the participant was required to judge whether
or not the riddle is humorous and to press the button after
the question mark “?”, which was presented for 1 sec
followed by a cross-hair for 5 sec, was presented.
We used an event-related design to minimize habituation
and learning effects. The 34 paired riddles were presented in
a pseudorandom order. The paired riddles were presented in
different sessions. In total, two sessions, each with 17
candidates of humorous riddles and 17 candidates of nonhumorous riddles, were run, and the session order was
counterbalanced across participants.
All images were acquired using a 3-Tesla MR scanner
(Allegra; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). For functional
imaging during the sessions, an ascending T2*-weighted
gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) procedure was
used to produce 34 continuous 4-mm thick transaxial slices
covering the entire cerebrum and cerebellum (time
repetition [TR], 2000 ms; time echo [TE], 30 ms; flip angle,
85°; field of view [FoV], 192 mm; 64 × 64 matrix; voxel
dimensions, 3.0 × 3.0 × 4.0 mm). Oblique scanning was
used to exclude the eyeballs from the images. Each session
consisted of a continuous series of 354 volume acquisitions
with a total duration of 11 min 48 sec. For anatomical
imaging, T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapidacquisition gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) images were also
obtained (TR, 2500 ms; TE, 4.38 ms; flip angle, 8°; FoV,
230 mm; 1 slab; number of slices per slab, 192; voxel
dimensions, 0.9 × 0.9 × 1.0 mm).
After the fMRI session, the participant was asked to select
the best reason for the judgment among the given
possibilities (Nakamura, 2009) in order to remove the
reasons in which we were not interested. The given options
for judging non-humorous were “non-understandable,”
“banal,” “objectionable” and “too serious.” The given
options for judging humorous were “sympathetic,”
“convincing,” “to-the-point” and “close to banal.” The total
duration of the experiment was under 60 min, including the
acquisition of the structural MR images and these responses.

Methods
Participants
Twenty participants (10 females and 10 males; mean age,
23.3 years; range, 18–37 years) were recruited as paid
volunteers for the fMRI experiment. All participants had
normal/corrected-to-normal visual acuity, and were righthanded according to the Edinburgh handedness inventory
(Oldfield, 1971), and no history of neurological/psychiatric
illness. They were educated higher than high-school
graduates. Written informed consent in order to take part in
this study was obtained following procedures approved by
the Ethical Committee of the National Institute for
Physiological Sciences, Japan.

Preparation of task materials
The riddles had the following structure: “Given A, I'd say B.
Do you know why? It is because X.” The topics for the
riddles were obtained from an article (Nakamura, 2009) and
Internet searches by Google (http://www.google.com) in
order to create candidates for strongly humorous riddles.
For example, “Given ‘savings,’ I’d say ‘a smile of my wife,’
Do you know why? It is because if they disappear, I will be
in trouble.” Then, we altered the response word of each
riddle in order to create candidates for weakly humorous
version. For example, “Given ‘savings,’ I’d say ‘a credit
card,’ Do you know why? It is because if they disappear, I
will be in trouble.”
In order to select well-controlled pairs of riddles, 8
normal volunteers (4 females and 4 males; mean age, 27.0
years; range, 22–44 years) participated in a pilot study. We
selected a paired riddle if one of the pair was evaluated
humorous by over one third of participants and the other one
was evaluated non-humorous by over one third of
participants. We obtained 24 topics from the article and
created 24 pairs of riddles, but 8 were removed after the
pilot study. We also obtained 20 topics from the Internet
searches and created 20 pairs of riddles, but 2 were rejected.
So, finally, we selected 34 pairs of riddles and used them in
the fMRI session.

fMRI procedures
Prior to the fMRI session, the participants received detailed
instructions and an explanation of the task procedure, and
were trained with training stimuli that were not used during
the fMRI session. All stimuli were prepared and presented
using Presentation 14.8 software (Neurobehavioral Systems,
Albany, CA) running on a personal computer. Using a
liquid crystal display (LCD) projector, the visual stimuli

Figure 1: The amygdala as a detector of optimal relevance (an interaction area of the 2 × 2 factorial design).
The weighted sum of the parameter estimates in the
individual analyses constituted the contrast images, which
were used for the group analysis with a random effectsmodel to make population-level inferences regarding the
task-related activation. The contrast images obtained by the
individual analyses represent the normalized task-related
increment of the MR signal of each participant. In total, the
data from 15 participants (other 5 contained no convincingbanal pairs) and four different contrasts (3e, 4e, 3a, and 4a)
were incorporated into the 2 (humor effect) × 2 (its time
course effect) factorial design (Friston et al., 2007). As a
result of the factorial design, a significant interaction was
found in the bilateral amygdalae, which we defined as
regions of interest and used as an explicit mask. In order to
show the difference of activated timing of the Amygdala,
four different contrasts (3e vs. 3a, 3a vs. 3e, 4e vs. 4a, and
4a vs. 4e) were used in the one-sample t-tests with the
explicit mask image. In order to check the activation of each
phase, six different contrasts against the rest condition (12e,
3e, 4e, 12a, 3a, and 4a) were used in the one-sample t-tests.
The statistical threshold was set at p < .05 with a
correction for multiple comparisons at the cluster level.

Data analysis
Performance In this study, we assumed that the judgment
about whether or not a riddle is humorous was based on
several different reasons, which we separated out using our
experimental design. We created paired riddles which
contained humorous version and non-humorous version, and
we called convincing-banal pairs if one of the pair was
judged humorous because it was convincing by a participant
and the other of the pair was judged non-humorous because
it was banal by the same participant. Only riddles of
convincing-banal pairs were included in the following
analyses. Other reasons were rejected because they could
contain negative values or ambiguous meanings.
Imaging data The preprocessing of the imaging data was
performed as follows. The first 6 EPI volumes of each
session were eliminated to allow for the stabilization of the
magnetization, and the remaining 348 EPI volumes per
session (a total of 696 EPI volumes per participant for two
sessions) were used for the analyses. The data were
analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8;
Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London,
UK; Friston, Ashburner, Kiebel, Nichols, & Penny, 2007).
The EPI volumes were realigned to correct for head motion,
and corrected for differences in slice timing within each
volume. Then, the whole-head MP-RAGE image volume
was coregistered with the mean image volume of the EPI
volumes, and segmented into the gray and the white matter
volumes using the Montreal Neurological Institute T1 image
template. The normalizing parameters of the segmentation
were applied to the all EPI volumes. After that, the EPI
volumes were spatially smoothed in three dimensions using
an 8 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel.
The signal time course for each participant was modeled
with a general linear model. Regressors of interest (trial
effects) of the 10 conditions (12e, 3e, 4e, 12a, 3a, 4a, 12z,
3z, 4z, and J) were generated using a box-car function
convolved with a hemodynamic-response function
(Abbreviation: 12, the 1st and the 2nd phase; 3, the 3rd
phase; 4, the 4th phase; J, the judgment phase; e, judging
humorous (i.e., convincing of convincing-banal pairs); a,
judging non-humorous (i.e., banal of the pairs); z, judging
as other six reasons in which we were not interested).

Results
Behavioral performance
During the fMRI experiment, 734 riddles (54.0%) were
judged humorous, while 626 riddles (46.0%) were judged
non-humorous. After the fMRI session, 231 riddles (17.0%)
were judged convincing, while 243 riddles (17.9%) were
judged banal. Then, the 43 paired riddles (6.32%) were
judged as convincing-banal pairs, which were used in the
following imaging data analysis (a random-effects model).

Group analysis with a random-effects model
In the 2 × 2 factorial design, no significant main effect was
found, but a significant interaction was found in the bilateral
amygdalae (see Figure 1 for a spread cluster and Table 1 for
peak-levels). In the interaction area, the left amygdala was
significantly activated in the 4th phase before the riddle was
judged humorous and also in the 3rd phase before the riddle
was considered banal (non-humorous), while the right
amygdala was significantly activated in the 4th phase before
the riddle was judged humorous (see Table 2).

a riddle humorous through the time course of humor
appreciation. We were also able to reproduce the other
activations recorded in other studies.
Relevance-related activation of amygdala On the basis of
a significant interaction in the 2 × 2 factorial design, we
argue that the amygdala is a candidate for relevance-based
processing. The left amygdala was significantly activated in
the 4th phase when the riddle was to be judged as humorous.
It was also activated in the 3rd phase when the riddle was to
be judged banal (non-humorous). Thus, we claim that the
left amygdala functions as a detector of optimal relevance
during humor appreciation. The right amygdala was
significantly activated only in the 4th phase when the riddle
was to be judged humorous, and hence we argue that the
right amygdala is a kind of positive value detector.
While previous studies have suggested that the bilateral or
the left amygdala activation involves in positive emotion
(Bartolo et al., 2006; Bekinschtein et al., 2011; Mobbs et al.,
2003; Moran et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2007), our results
suggested that the left amygdala activation involves in
relevance detection because it was found not only in the 4th
phase of judging humorous (i.e., positive emotion) but also
in the 3rd phase of judging non-humorous (i.e., non-positive
or negative emotion). If same brain parts are activated in
both opposite values, the distinction between positive and
negative emotion could not be critical feature, but we argue
that the common feature of positive and negative emotion,
that is, relevance for the organism is more important.

When the riddle was to be judged humorous in the end,
significant activations were found mainly in the left
hemisphere of the cerebral cortex: (12e) the bilateral
fusiform gyri (BA 37), the bilateral inferior occipital gyri
(BA 17–19), the left middle frontal gyrus (BA 9), and the
left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21); (3e) the left inferior
frontal gyrus (BA 47/45); (4e) the left posterior rostral
medial frontal cortex (prMFC; BA 8/6), the left inferior
frontal gyrus (BA 9/45), the left fusiform gyrus (BA 37),
and the left inferior occipital gyrus (BA 18/19). When the
riddle was to be judged banal (non-humorous), on the other
hand, significant activations were found mainly in the left
hemisphere and left amygdala: (12a) the bilateral inferior
occipital gyri (BA 18–19); (3a) the left amygdala; (4a) the
left prMFC (BA 8/6) including the left anterior cingulate
cortex (BA 32), the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 9/45), and
the bilateral inferior occipital gyri (BA 18/19).

Humor-related activation of left hemisphere Our results
also reproduced previous neuroimaging studies of humor
appreciation. The activation of the left fusiform gyrus in
(12e) and (4e) is interpreted as incongruity detection of
humor (Mobbs et al., 2003). The activation of the left
middle frontal gyrus in (12e) and the left inferior frontal
gyrus in (4e) are interpreted as incongruity or ambiguity
resolution of humor (Mobbs et al., 2003; Moran et al., 2004).
So, the activation of these areas corresponds to the
incongruity resolution a la Suls (1972). The activation of the
left middle temporal gyrus in (12e) is interpreted as
semantic comprehension of humor (Moran et al., 2004).
Considering that the prMFC has been suggested to
represent and update the value of possible future actions
such as response selection (Amodio & Frith, 2006), the
activation of the left prMFC in (4e) and (4a) is interpreted
as being involved in judging whether or not a riddle is
humorous. The left inferior frontal gyrus is also activated in
both (4e) and (4a), so it might be also involved in the
selection. Considering the participants of this study looked
at written riddles, the activation of the inferior occipital
gyrus is interpreted as seeing effects. So, our results
correspond well to previous neuroimaging studies.

Discussion
Performance
There are clear individual differences in the way humor is
appreciated. In this study, we were interested in the
amygdala detecting the optimal relevance during humor
appreciation, and we used convincing-banal pairs in order to
strictly cancel out the effects in which we were not interested. In the 3rd and the 4th phase of a paired riddle, same
participants read same stimuli, so only effect of the 2nd
phase, which was modeled out in the 2 × 2 factorial design,
was remained. Thus, a significance level in the following
analysis can be reached with data of only 15 participants.

Neural activation

Conclusions

The present study revealed that the amygdalae are
specifically involved in relevance-based understanding,
showing that the amygdalae have a key role in appreciating

Our results highlight the neural substrates for the detection
of optimal relevance. When a participant explicitly judges

801

the answer to the riddle humorous, the relevance of the
answer has been detected implicitly as the activation of the
amygdala at the 4th phase. On the other hand, when the
participant judges the answer to the riddle non-humorous
because it is banal, its relevance has been detected as the
activation of the amygdala earlier at the 3rd phase.
Therefore, we argue that the amygdala is a detector of
optimal relevance in the process of humor appreciation.
