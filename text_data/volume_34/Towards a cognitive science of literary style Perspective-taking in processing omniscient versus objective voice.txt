Three participants were excluded for being left-handed, and
an additional three participants were excluded due to low
accuracy (below 80%) to picture verification or question
comprehension. One item was excluded for its low accuracy
rate (below 80%). The image, of sushi, may have been
problematic because it depicted a type of sushi not typically
available in the United States, which might have confused
participants. Extremely slow responses (those over 4000
ms), incorrect responses to picture verifications and/or to
comprehension questions, and responses that were more
than 2.5sd above or below the mean response time for each
participant were removed. This resulted in eliminating
11.8% of the data (3.0% exclusion due to incorrect picture
verification, 4.8% due to inaccurate response to
comprehension questions, and 4.0% due to the outliers).
