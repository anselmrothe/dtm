noted that we tend to whisper or speak louder when others

interactions, mimicry translates into a greater desire to want
to cooperate and affiliate with those individuals imitating
our gestures (Chartrand and Bargh, 1999). In spite of the

Testing the Generalizability of the Model                                                 400
Given that the model succeeded at capturing the data from
Boyer et al. (in press), we sought to test its generalizability
as a means of providing further evidence that spatial and
imitative compatibilities are not mediated by the same                                    350
