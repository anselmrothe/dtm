amount of data were twice as much in the latter. This may
be due to features of our experimental design. There was
relatively little reason to avoid additional demonstrations
(among other things, each additional knob only took a
second to press). Furthermore, our dependent measure asked
learners to rate the helpfulness of the informant and learners
have little reason to consider an exhaustive informant
unhelpful. Finally, the additional demonstrations genuinely
reduced some uncertainty: each toy was unique and the
training only provided a few examples to establish the base
rate of the effective knobs. Had the learners been more
certain about the number of working knobs, they might have
shown a stronger bias against exhaustive evidence.
   We have presented evidence that learners’ choice of
informants is not solely guided the sheer amount of
information; learners do not merely maximize the amount of
data they can observe, nor do they minimize it. Learners use
their inductive certainty to decide when enough is enough.
