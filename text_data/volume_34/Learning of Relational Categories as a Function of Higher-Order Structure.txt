           Experiment and Model Results
Subjects varied in how much time they took to learn the
training tasks, and hence in how much time they had for the
main task. To reduce statistical noise and ensure all subjects
had enough time to learn their condition’s category
structure, a selection criterion was used to exclude subjects
who spent over 35 minutes on the training tasks (leaving
less than 20 minutes for the main task). Because this
criterion is based on events prior to the experimental
manipulation, it introduces no bias in estimating differences
among conditions. The selection left 104 subjects in the
analysis. Of these subjects, the fewest number of trials
completed on the main task was 245.
