distinguishing between alligators versus crocodiles, for
example). Low within-category similarity, on the other
hand, refers to category structures in which the exemplars of
the same category share very few features (as is the case for
the category “animal,” for example).
   Each one of these two kinds of categories requires
different mechanisms for efficient category learning. In the
case of high between-category similarity, one has to identify
subtle differences between categories, which might be
facilitated by frequent alternation. However, rapid
alternation between two categories with low within-category
similarity will not allow for the identification of the relevant
properties characteristic of a category. In this case it might
be more beneficial to block exemplars of each category
separately so that the learner can identify the shared features
among members of a category hidden within their diversity.
   By this analysis, the best presentation schedule would
depend upon the learning situation at hand. In this paper we
