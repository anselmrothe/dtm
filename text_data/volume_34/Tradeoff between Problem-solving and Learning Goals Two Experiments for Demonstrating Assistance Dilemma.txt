support condition, the problem-solving performance is higher
than in the low level support condition, but the learning effect
was reduced; therefore in the posttest where no supports are
given, participants who learned in the high level support con-

tion.
   We tested this hypothesis using two experimental tasks. In
Experiment 1 we used the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) puzzle,
which is one representative experimental task widely used in
problems-solving studies. In Experiment 2, the participants
engaged in a natural deduction (ND) task.
   TOH is a simpler task. The problem space is systematically
organized and is not so large. Problem solving is achieved by
only one operator that corresponds to disk movement. The
knowledge and strategies for the solution are represented by
less than ten production rules. ND is a more complex task.
Its problem space is much larger than that of TOH. To solve
problems, since participants must acquire many kinds of in-
ference rules and solution strategies, a complete model for            Figure 1: Example screen shot of experimental system for
