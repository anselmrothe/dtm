                                Abstract
   Drawing on insights from recent work on phonetic adaptation,
   we examined how listeners interpret prosodic cues to two op-
   posing pragmatic meanings of the phrase “It looks like an X”
   (e.g., “It looks like a zebra (and it is one)” and “It LOOKS like
   a zebra (but its actually not)”. After establishing that differ-
   ent prosodic contours map onto these meanings (Experiment
   1), we demonstrated that prosodic interpretation is shifted by
   inclusion of another alternative (Experiment 2); the reliabil-
   ity a speaker’s use of prosody to signal pragmatic alternatives          Figure 1: Waveforms (top) and pitch contours (bottom) of the
