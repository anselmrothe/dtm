                    Discovery Learning
Our study represents a form of discovery learning (Bruner,
1961), also known as constructivist, inquiry or experiential
learning. In discovery learning students learn material inde-
pendently of explicit instruction by exploring environments,
solving problems, or performing experiments. Several re-
searchers have called into question the effectiveness of pure
discovery learning, suggesting that active guidance from an
instructor (Mayer, 2004), or a sufficient foundation of domain
knowledge (Kirschner, Sweller, & Clark, 2006) are required
for constructivist approaches to be successful.
   Our target audience for Divvy differs from the traditional
subjects used in studies of discovery learning. We intend for
Divvy to be used by researchers such as faculty and gradu-
ate students who have a highly sophisticated understanding
of their problem domain. Further, they are accustomed to
self-directed learning. In this sense, though they do not have
a detailed understanding of machine learning, they do have a
foundation of domain knowledge with which they can deter-           Figure 2: The Divvy UI used in this experiment. The tabs at
