set. This part of the simulation was intended to put into the
network the lexical knowledge that a typical child would
bring to the laboratory NNG task.
Testing Following training, the next step was to identify
what sort of word learning biases each run of the network
had developed. We addressed this question with a virtual
version of the NNG task. We presented the network with
three NNG tasks, one for each of the three types of items:
solids, clear non-solids, and ambiguous non-solids. On each
test trial of these tasks, we presented the network with a
triad of novel entities (one at a time) on the perceptual layer.
The triad consisted of an exemplar and two choice items,
one matching the exemplar in shape only and one matching             Figure 2: Mean proportion of shape match choices at test for

identify how this point of emergence of the shape bias in
solids affects the network’s behavior concerning the two
kinds of non-solids. We isolated the closest time points in
learning both preceding and following the emergence of the
shape bias. Using this focused time window, we examined
