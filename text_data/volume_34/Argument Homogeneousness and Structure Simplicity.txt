homogeneous eventuality constructions are simpler than
those of heterogeneous ones.
  A parallel analysis of noun constructions is found in Borer
(2005) and Zhang (2012). In Borer’s analysis, CLP or DivP
is projected for count nominals, but not for mass nominals.
In Zhang (2012), DelimitP is projected for non-mass
nominals, but it is absent in the structures of mass nominals.
In both analyses, the structures of mass nominals are
simpler than those of count nouns. The former shows
homogeneousness, whereas the latter does not.
   The significance of this study is that, like Borer’s (2005)
and Zhang’s (2012) studies of nominal structures, our
research of verbal structures here also show that the
perceived homogeneousness in our understanding of the
world, including events and individuals, correlates with the
simplicity of linguistic structures.
