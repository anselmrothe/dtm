ture in terms of semantic properties (e.g., visual features, the
functions of an artefact). The output of Strudel is a list of
properties linked to the corresponding concept through a pat-
tern describing the relation between the concept and the prop-
erty. An example is the relation elephant in jungle, in which
the concept elephant is related to the property jungle via the
pattern in. The set of properties for each concept is computed
based on the number of co-occurrences in the corpus, taking
into account the number of relevant patterns. The properties
that Strudel generates this way are cognitively plausible in the
sense that they overlap with human-generated feature norms
such as the McRae et al. (2005) norms, as Baroni et al. (2010)
demonstrate.
