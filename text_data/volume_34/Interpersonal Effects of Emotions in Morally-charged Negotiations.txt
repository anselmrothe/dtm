Corresponding effects were not obtained for the non-sacred
objects (water bottles, food cans, money). Repeated
measures ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction,
with proposal round number as the within-subjects factor,
and SV/NoSV and displayed-emotion as between-subjects
factors, determined an overall main effect of time (p <
0.001) for all the four objects, and an interaction between
time, SV/NoSV and agent’s emotion for medicine (F(4.585,

were not obtained for the non-sacred objects.
   To further analyze the differences in concession rates

difference (number of packages in the first offer deducted
from last offer) for medicine as a dependent variable in a 2

emotional reaction (sadness/anger) and the second factor
was the presence or absence of sacred values. For medicine,
there was a significant interaction between SV and the
