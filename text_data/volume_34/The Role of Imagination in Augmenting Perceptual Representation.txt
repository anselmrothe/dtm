Participants Thirty-one (18 boys and 13 girls) 5th grade
elementary school students from the New York City public
schools district participated in this study and were divided
into two groups: imagination group (n = 15) and non-
imagination (control) group (n = 16). The study was IRB
approved.
Children of this age were chosen because they were almost
at the end of concrete operational stage. Therefore, they are
expected to use the appropriate level of inductive logic, such
as transitivity, decentering, ability to eliminate egocentrism,
and etc. (Piaget, 1977).
