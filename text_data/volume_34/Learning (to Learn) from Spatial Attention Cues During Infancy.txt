   My 3-year PhD investigated how different attention cues
(or no cues) affect learning during infancy. My studies
showed for the first time in one cohesive paradigm that the
presence and nature of these attention cues mediate what
infants learn about the structures in the environment (i.e.,
predicting the appearance of audio-visual events or forming
expectations about co-occurring features). A sample of over
450 infants across four extensive eye-tracking studies (Wu
& Kirkham, 2010; Wu, Gopnik, et al., 2011; Wu, Kirkham,
et al., under revision) showed that by 8 months, infants
learned the structures in their environment significantly
better with subtle social cues (e.g., eye gaze, infant-directed
speech) than with salient non-social cues (e.g., flashing
squares) or without any attentional cueing. Importantly,
when presented with multiple events to learn and cued by a
face (rather than a flashing square) to one specific event,
infants learned the cued event rather than the non-cued
event. These results show that when naïve learners do not
know what to learn, social objects (faces) shape the
likelihood of learning cued targets, and that attending to                 Figure 1: Stimuli and results from Study 1. Mean

Study 2 Study 2 used visual statistical learning as the
dependent measure, and compared how infants learn from
social cues to that with no cues. In laboratory experiments,
infants can learn patterns of co-occurring visual features
(e.g., Fiser & Aslin, 2002). Once infants learn the statistical
regularities, however, how do they use the knowledge? In
addition, which patterns do infants learn when presented
with many options (as in the cluttered world outside of the
laboratory)? In this study, infants were shown clusters of 3
shapes, where two always co-occurred and a third changed
on every trial. Infants were either shown these shape
patterns on their own (Experiments 1 and 2) or shown the
pattern cued by a face (Experiment 3) or also with a
distracter pattern in a non-cued location (Experiment 4).
Test trials displayed shapes moving apart: either the co-
occurring shapes (looking longer related to a preference for
the inconsistent/violation of expectation) or the non-co-
occurring shapes (looking longer related to a preference for
the consistent). Tracking co-occurring units and inferring
that they are larger fused units help identify integral object
parts for object individuation, recognition, and
categorization. Experiment 1 showed that 9-month-old
infants interpret co-occurring features as larger fused units
(i.e., infants looked longer when co-occurring features split
apart). The other three experiments showed that social cues           Figure 2: Stimuli and results from Study 2. The top half of

                                                                    training, familiarization, and test. During the training phase,
                                                                    9-month-olds interacted with a centrally presented teapot
                                                                1163

(similar to Deligianni, Senju, Gergeley, & Csibra, 2011,
who found that infants follow such interactive objects).
Infants’ fixations on the teapot caused it to jump or lift its
lid. During the familiarization and test phases, infants were
presented with the pattern events from Study 2, with the
original face now replaced by the teapot. We found that if
infants followed the teapot during familiarization, they
seemed to have trouble learning about the cued event, only
perhaps learning the cued location (general spatial learning
similar to 4-month-olds cued by a face in Study 1). Infants
who did not follow the teapot (and perhaps ignored this cue)
seemed to learn about the non-cued event. While only
preliminary observations can be made at this stage, this pilot
study begins to address how infants learn to use cues, rather
than describing cues they do or do not learn from.
Study 4 In Study 1, the flashing square cue was
unsuccessful at producing specific learning in infants (Wu
& Kirkham, 2010). Study 4 investigated whether the pairing
of familiar social cues with unfamiliar flashing cues could
help infants learn from these novel flashing cues. Nine-
month-old infants were eye-tracked during a Training phase,
followed by a Generalization phase. In the Social
Scaffolding condition, the Training phase consisted of an
expressive face that spoke to the infant and then froze with a
smile, while identical audio-visual animations appeared in
diagonally opposite corners. At the same time, a red flashing
square cued the infant to a specific target frame containing
an object. In the Extended Practice condition, infants only
saw the flashing square and multimodal events. The
Generalization phase for both conditions displayed new
audio-visual events with only the red flashing square cues.
The test trials in each phase played one of the sounds
previously associated with a particular animation, and
looking time to each location was measured. In the Social
Scaffolding condition, infants anticipated that the events
would appear in the correct cued locations for both phases.          Figure 3: Stimuli and results from familiarization and test
