information to redirect attention even though participants
are told the gaze cue is irrelevant to the task. In a review of
12 experiments, 8 revealed no differences between autism
and control groups with this method (review, Nation &
Penny, 2008), suggesting reflexive orienting of attention to
gaze cues in ASD is fairly typical. As mentioned above, this
failure to find a difference could be due to the lack of social
context in the stimuli. A study using eye-tracking methods
examined attention to objects in a person’s line of gaze in a
real-world scene. While individuals with autism reliably
followed the person’s gaze to the objects, they looked less at
the objects of attention than controls (Freeth, Chapman,
Ropar, & Mitchell, 2010). This study illustrates typical gaze
following in ASD individuals, but suggests atypical use of
gaze information (i.e., less looking at the objects). One
limitation of the study, though, is that the gaze cues were so
salient in the scenes that the study may not be tapping into
more subtle, real-world difficulties in attention to and use of
gaze information to orient attention to relevant aspects in

saliency values from the pixels that contained a change

each change region using Matlab. Another potential low-

graphical presentation, values are described as proportions

log-odds ratios and as raw response times (after excluding
times exceeding two standard deviations from each
participant’s mean response time) rather than log
transformed times.
                              Results
Gaze cues facilitate change detection
   Participants first detected 53.5% of the changes in the line
of gaze compared to only 25.3% of the changes not in the
line of gaze; this 28.2% difference was reflected in a
significant main effect of gaze (see Figure 3a; b = 1.46, SE
= 0.47, z = 3.09, p < .01). Unsurprisingly, participants were
(marginally significantly) more likely to first detect changes
that were larger (b = 0.30, SE = 0.02, z = 1.69, p < .10).
Although participants first detected numerically more
changes in the periphery than in the center (37% vs. 32%),
this difference did not reach significance (b = 0.64, SE =
0.39, z = 1.64, n.s.). There was, however, a marginally
significant effect of location when the covariates of size,
saliency, and grounding were not included in the model (b =
0.90 SE = 0.54, z = 1.68, p < .10); this likely reflects the fact
that center changes were nearly always also foreground
