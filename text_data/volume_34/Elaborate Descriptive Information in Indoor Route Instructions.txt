ing memorization.
    While our route instruction system has already been suc-
cessfully evaluated (Cuayáhuitl, Dethlefs, Richter, Tenbrink,
& Bateman, 2010), the goal of the present study is to ex-
plore the boundaries and potential for further development of
the system by using a particularly difficult route which con-
tains areas for which we consider the current (standard) ap-
proach lacking. For this purpose we first conduct and present
an experiment which compares the wayfinding performance
of participants receiving instructions, based either on solely
procedural strategies as used by the system, or on a system-
atic mixture of procedural and descriptive strategies which
the system currently does not provide. The results are pre-
sented and discussed with respect to the insights that can be
gained for the development of route direction systems using
natural language generation. In conclusion we propose direc-
tions that future research in the area could take.
                     Experimental Setup
The experiment was conducted in GW2, a building at the Uni-
versity of Bremen which is notorious for its complexity. Each
of the four floors has a different layout consisting of one or
two main areas. The route (figure 1) was specifically chosen
to be long and difficult, contain many turns and lead through
a large portion of the 3rd level of the building. Secondly, it
should contain two areas (A and B in figure 1) characterized
by scene space rather than by network space. In both cases a
diagonal crossing of the open area was necessary.
    In our experiment the participants made use of an indoor        Figure 1: The selected route for the experiment. Grey dotted
