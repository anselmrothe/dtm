Abstract
Employing the implicit priming task, we examined whether
Chinese words that shared the initial onset consonant could be
typed, using the phonetic-based method (called zhuyin), with
faster response times than words that did not share the initial
onset consonant. We also examined the effect of sharing the
initial tonal syllable. A significant onset preparation effect
and a significant syllable preparation effect were both
observed. The latter was found to vary linearly with the
number of segments in the syllable. The slope of 63 ms was
similar to the 70-ms onset effect, suggesting that the syllable
effect was segment-based. The results contrasted with the lack
of an onset effect previously reported for speaking, and were
interpreted as supporting the Output Constraint Hypothesis
which states that the kind of outputs a production system is
designed to produce (speaking vs. typing) can flexibly and
adaptively alter the way the system is organized and operates.

Introduction
With the popularization of computers and internet, typing
has become a new form of communication that may
someday dominate our social life. It is, therefore, of interest
to study the cognitive processes involved in typing, in
particular, how typing as a language production activity
may differ from speaking. Past research has studied typing
more as a skilled motor activity during transcription
(Shaffer, 1975; Sternberg et al., 1978; Rumelhart & Norman,
1982; Norman & Rumelhart, 1983; Salthouse, 1986; Crump
& Logan, 2010a, 2010b) than as a language production
activity.
In a spoken language production model (e.g., Dell, 1986;
MacKay, 1987; Levelt et al., 1999), word form encoding
refers to the hierarchically organized processes that translate
the semantic/syntactic representation of a word into its
phonological and phonetic forms. The processes involve
retrieving the structural frame and the phonemic segments
of a word, followed by assigning, in a sequential order, the
segments to their categorized slots in the frame. An issue
under much debate concerns the units that make up the
stored phonological representation of a word and drive the
phonological encoding process. In some models, they
contain the syllables (e.g, Dell, 1986; MacKay, 1987), while
in others they do not (e.g., Levelt et al., 1999). Prevailing
evidence from Indo-European languages suggests that the
units are the segments (e.g., Meyer, 1990, 1991; Roelofs &
Meyer, 1998; Roelofs, 1999; Schiller, 1998, 2004; Schiller
& Costa, 2006). But in Mandarin Chinese, they appear to be
the syllables (J.-Y. Chen et al., 2002; J.-Y. Chen et al., 2003;
T.-M. Chen et al., 2007; O’Seaghdha et al., 2010). The

204

varying units of a word’s stored phonological representation
in different languages may have something to do with the
rhythmic structures of the languages (Cutler et al., 1986;
Otake et al., 1996).
The units may also vary with different kinds of outputs
targeted by different production tasks within the same
language, e.g., typing as opposed to speaking. Mandarin
Chinese provides an excellent testing bed for evaluating this
hypothesis. A popular method of typing in Chinese uses the
phonetic alphabet called zhuyin in Taiwan and pinyin in
China. For example, to type the character 潔 (‘clean’, jie2)
in zhuyin, the onset consonant j, the medial glide i, the
rhyme e, and the tone 2 are typed on a keyboard
sequentially, followed by the selection among a list of
homophones. To this extent, zhuyin typing requires
accessing the phonological codes of the character, much like
speaking. Employing a traditional (unmasked) priming task
and comparing naming with zhuyin typing, our previous
study (Chen & Li, 2011) investigated whether syllable onset
priming was absent in naming, which would be consistent
with our findings for speaking (J.-Y. Chen et al., 2002; J.-Y.
Chen et al., 2009; O’Seaghdha et al., 2010), but might be
present in zhuyin typing.
A possible reason for predicting onset priming in zhuyin
typing is that the output of zhuyin typing consists of discrete
manual keystrokes that correspond to the onset, medial,
rhyme and tone of a syllable. This is different from the
output of naming (and speaking), which consists of syllablesized articulatory gestures. That is, the different output
characteristics constrain the way a word is planned during
speaking and typing. Indeed, Berg (2002) observed that
slips of the key resembled slips of the pen, but not slips of
the tongue. He suggested that ‘speaking is characterized by
a hierarchical strategy of activation while typewriting is
subject to the so-called staircase strategy of serialization in
which activation is a function of linear distance’ (p.185).
Although such a prediction seems obvious and only
expected, there are reasons to predict otherwise too.
Studying handwriting, Kandel and colleagues (Kandel et al.,
2006; Lambert et al., 2007; Alverez et al., 2009) found that
interletter intervals were longer between syllables than
within syllables and that the number of syllables of a word
modulated the time course of handwriting production,
indicating that word syllable structure constrains motor
production both in French and Spanish. Given that very
similar processes are believed to underlie typing and writing
(Berg, 2002), it is reasonable to assume that syllables are
also essential units of processing in typing. Direct evidence
for this assumption has also been reported (Nottbusch et al.,
2005). The results from primed naming and primed zhuyin

typing showed significant onset priming for zhuyin typing
but not for naming, supporting the hypothesis that the units
of the stored phonological representation of a word vary
with different kinds of outputs targeted by different
production tasks within the same language. We will refer to
this hypothesis as the Output Constraint Hypothesis (OCH).
In the present study, the OCH was tested further with the
implicit priming task. The implicit priming task (also known
as the form preparation task) has been used extensively in
investigating the word form encoding processes in spoken
production (Meyer, 1990). The task requires the participants
to learn a set of prompt-target word pairs during the learning
phase. During the testing phase, the prompt words are
shown one at a time and the participants have to say the
corresponding target words as responses. The target words
are arranged in a homogeneous context such that they share
the initial portion of their phonological forms (e.g., the onset
consonant). In a heterogeneous context, the same target
words are re-arranged such that they no longer share the
initial portion of the phonological forms. Response latencies
tend to be shorter when the target words are produced, upon
the presentation of the prompt words, in the homogeneous
context than in the heterogeneous context. The response
benefit is attributed to the suspension-resumption
mechanism in the production system, according to which
the system prepares a word from left to right in an
incremental fashion, and it can prepare the word as far to the
right as the left portion is known. The system suspends the
operation when everything that is known has been prepared,
and resumes operation as soon as information about the rest
of the word is received. It is assumed that the portion that
can be prepared by the system represents the unit of word
form encoding during spoken production (Roelofs, 1997a,
1997b). Sufficient evidence has indicated that this unit must
be the size of a syllable in Mandarin Chinese, but can be a
phonemic segment in English and Dutch.
Because previous studies in Mandarin Chinese have
already consistently documented no onset preparation effect
with an implicit priming task in speaking (Chen, Chen,
&Dell, 2002; O’Seaghdha, Chen, & Chen, 2010), the
present study examined typing only, but contrasted the
findings with those reported for speaking base on the same
materials. The OCH predicts that the onset segment of a
Chinese word can be prepared during zhuyin typing, i.e., an
onset preparation effect is predicted in an implicit priming
task of zhuyin typing.
In addition to the syllable onset, the full syllable was also
examined. If phonological encoding in zhuyin typing is
segment-driven as predicted by the OCH, a syllable
preparation effect that is a function of the number of
segments in a syllable should be observed.

the onset experiment, and another sixteen for the syllable
experiment. They were all native and habitual zhuyin typists,
i.e., they learned the zhuyin typing when they first learned
typing and have been typing in zhuyin ever since. All the
participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and
they were paid for participation.

Apparatus and Materials
The experiment was programmed in DMDX (Forster &
Forster, 2003) and run on a personal computer (Intel®
Core™2 Quad CPU, Q6600@2.40GHz) with a 20-inch
LED screen (32bits, 1400x1050 pixels, 8-ms refresh rate)
and a standard keyboard that included marks of the zhuyin
letters.
The stimulus materials for the onset experiment were
disyllabic words taken out of Experiment 5 of J.-Y. Chen et
al. (2002). They consisted of four sets of prompt-target
word pairs, with four pairs in each set. The prompt and the
target in a pair bore clear semantic or associative
relationship such that they could be learned easily. The
target words were chosen such that they shared the same
onset consonant of the first syllable in a set. Across the four
sets, four different onset consonants were used (m, d, sh, l).
These formed the homogeneous sets (see Set 1-4 in Table 1).
The same target words were reshuffled to form the four
heterogeneous sets such that within a set the target words no
longer shared the onset consonant (see Set 5-8 in Table 1).
The arrangement of the stimulus materials was identical to
that of J.-Y. Chen et al. (2002) Experiment 5.
The stimulus materials for the syllable experiment were
disyllabic words taken out of Experiment 3 of T.-M. Chen
& J.-Y. Chen (2006) (see Table 2), and arranged in the same
way. The target words in a homogeneous set shared the first
tonal syllables.

initiated within 2000 ms of the presentation of the prompt
word, a feedback tone of 500 Hz was sounded for 200 ms.
The next trial began after another 200 ms. A practice session
containing four trials was given before the experiment
began. The participants were seated 60 cm from the screen.
Each character measured 1.6 cm in height and 1.1 cm in
width at that viewing distance.

Results
Onset Experiment
Error rates were 2% in the homogeneous condition and 4%
in the heterogeneous condition. Response times ranged from
374 to 1946 ms for the homogeneous trials (mean: 825, SD:
190), and ranged from 354 to 1988 ms for the heterogeneous
trials (mean: 894, SD: 195). No apparent outliers were noted.
All response times (RTs) for the correct trials were then
analyzed using a linear mixed model (Statistical Analytic
System, the PROC MIXED procedure) with subjects and
items as random-effect variables and context, sequence,
round, repetition as fixed-effect variables. Most notable in
the analysis was the significant main effect of context: F(1,
14) = 33.67, p < .0001. The mean RT was 824 ms in the
homogeneous context and 894 ms in the heterogeneous
context. The difference represents an onset preparation
effect of 70 ms. The context effect varied with sequence:
F(1, 1465) = 4.92, p < .03, being greater when the
heterogeneous sets appeared first than when the
homogeneous sets appeared first. The context by sequence
interaction also varied with round: F(2, 1465) = 8.46, p
< .0005. The three-way interaction is manifested as the
context effect displaying an increasing trend when the
homogeneous trials were done first and a decreasing trend
when the heterogeneous trials were done first (see Table 2).
The remaining effects are not enumerated here because they
were either non-significant (p’s > .06) if they involved the
context factor, or significant but did not involve the context
factor. Table 3 summarizes the results by presenting the
mean RTs as a function of context, round, and sequence.

Design and Procedure
The design and the procedure were identical to the
experiments where we took the materials from. Each pair in
a set was repeated four times (the Repetition factor) so that
there were 16 pairs and they appeared in a random order
within a block. Half of the participants received the
homogeneous sets first and the other half received the
heterogeneous sets first (the Sequence factor). The
participants went through the round of homogeneous and
heterogeneous sets (the Context factor) three times (the
Round factor) and in the same sequence. The type of onset
consonants or syllables constituted another factor (Onset).
The Sequence factor was a between-subjects factor while
the rest were within-subjects factors.
During the learning phase, the participants were shown
the four pairs of words in a set. They learned the association
between the two words in each pair until they had
memorized the pairs well. Then the target words were cued
one at a time by their associated prompt words. When the
participants succeeded in reporting the target words
correctly without hesitation, they proceeded to the testing
phase. Otherwise, they repeated the learning phase.
During the testing phase, each trial began with a 1000-Hz
warning tone and two short dashed lines flanking a blank
space at the center of the screen. The tone and the dashed
lines appeared for 200 ms. The prompt word appeared in the
previously flanked space 600 ms later. The prompt word
stayed on the screen for 150 ms. Another 1850 ms elapsed
before the trial ended. The participants were told to type in
zhuyin the target word upon seeing the prompt word, as
quickly and accurately as possible. The participants entered
the zhuyin letters in the English input mode. Accordingly,
no homophonous characters were shown for selection after
the zhuyin letters of a character have been entered.
Response latencies were measured, to the accuracy of
milliseconds, from the presentation of the prompt word to

First

Although the participants were told to complete all key
presses without hesitation or pauses once a response was
initiated, it is possible that the homogenous context might
have encouraged a strategic behavior in them to start the
first key press without having planned for the subsequent
keys. If this was the case, the duration of a response should
be longer in the homogeneous context than in the
heterogeneous context. Unfortunately, response durations
were not available to rule out this possibility. However, we
plotted cumulative response latency distributions for the two
conditions, following Damian and Stadthagen-Gonzalez
(2009). As Figure 1 shows, the differences between the two
distributions are relatively uniform across the entire
spectrum of response latencies, suggesting that the strategy
of immaturely starting responses on homogeneous trials was
not used by our participants. The similar distributions of the
two conditions also rule out the possibility that participants
were able to locate the first key and initiate a response on
homogeneous trials sooner than on heterogeneous trials,
where the first keys were different and took time to locate.

Discussion

Error rates were 2% in the homogeneous condition and 5%
in the heterogeneous condition. Response times less than
250 ms were excluded, making up 0.8% of all trials, before
they were subject to the same kind of analysis as in the
onset experiment. The context effect was significant, with
the homogeneous RTs being 255 ms faster, on the average,
than the heterogeneous RTs (620 ms vs. 875 ms): F(1, 14) =
69.98, p < .0001. The context effect did not vary with
sequence (p > .8), but it increased significantly across
rounds (p < .01). The three-way interaction involving
context was not significant, p > .19. Table 4 summarizes the
results of the syllable experiment.
The cumulative distribution plot of Figure 2 shows no
clear evidence of strategic responding for the homogeneous

Employing the implicit priming task, a widely used tool for
studying word form encoding in spoken production, we
examined whether words that shared the initial onset
consonant could be typed with faster response times than
words that did not share the initial onset consonant. The
result of the experiment was clear. There was a significant
and sizeable onset preparation effect when words to be
typed shared the initial onset consonant (70 ms). This
contrasted interestingly with the small and non-significant
onset effect observed in our previous work when the task
was speaking (J.-Y. Chen et al., 2002, Experiment 5 with
the same material: -1 ms; O’Seaghdha et al., 2010,
Experiments 1-4 and 7 with different materials: 3, -6, 3, 4, 2
ms). We also observed a large tonal syllable preparation

207

effect which varied with the number of segments in the
syllable. The slope of 63 ms was similar to the 70 ms onset
preparation effect, suggesting that the syllable preparation
effect was likely segment-based. This also contrasted
interestingly with the syllable preparation effect previously
observed for speaking, which could be more unambiguously
attributed to the syllable. Together, these results extended
the previous findings of significant onset priming for typing
(30 ms) but no significant onset priming for naming (-5.6
ms) when an unmasked priming task was employed (Chen
& Li, 2011).
Speaking a Chinese word and typing it in zhuyin take the
same input for processing, i.e., the concept of the word.
They also require retrieving the same phonological
representation of the word. However, the two tasks have
different goals, aiming at different outputs. The findings of
the present study as well as the earlier one (Chen & Li, 2011)
suggest that the form of the output can constrain the internal
organization/mechanism of the production system. Speaking,
aiming at syllable-sized gestures, requires a syllable-driven
word form encoding process. Typing, aiming at segmentsized gestures, involves segment-sized word form encoding
process. Thus, all production systems are not organized in
the same way. The kind of outputs a production system is
designed to produce can flexibly and adaptively alter the
way the system is organized and operates.
It has been suggested that the traditional priming
paradigm and the implicit priming paradigm tap different
levels of word form encoding process (Levelt et al., 1999;
Cholin, Schiller, & Levelt, 2004). Traditional priming
works to pre-activate the segments of a word, facilitating its
phonological encoding process. Its effect takes place at the
early stage of phonological encoding. Implicit priming is
said to work at this early stage of phonological encoding as
well as at the later stages of phonological encoding and
phonetic encoding (i.e., online syllabification and possibly
accessing the mental syllabary). Because onset priming in
zhuyin typing was observed with both the explicit priming
paradigm and the implicit priming paradigm, it may be
concluded that the production system respects the form of
its output and gets ready for that form at the stage as early
as the beginning of the word form encoding process.
One caveat against the above conclusion is that typing is
typically much slower than speaking, indicating low
automaticity, and this is perhaps the reason that typing is
less hierarchically organized than speaking (Berg, 2002).
Future work will investigate this with professional typists.
The output constraint is not unique to the production
system only, but finds an analog in the perception system
too, where it is the input that constrains how the perception
system is organized and operates. For example, research has
shown that the structural and functional basis of word
recognition and reading varies between an alphabetic
writing system like English and a logographic writing
system like Chinese (Perfetti, Liu, & Tan, 2005; Tan,
Spinks, Eden, Perfetti, & Siok, 2005; Tzeng & Hung, 1981;
Kuo, Yeh, Duann, Wu et al., 2001; Kuo, Yeh, Lee, Wu et al.,

208

2003; Siok, Niu, Jin, Perfetti, & Tan, 2008; Siok, Perfetti,
Jin, & Tan, 2004).
When building a model of language processing, a
universal one is always preferred. But, even a universal
model needs to incorporate flexible parameters and
constraints to accommodate the variations across languages
and tasks. One source of such constraints might be sought
from the input and output a particular language system is
designed to process. This view carries the Gibsonian
tradition of emphasizing the role of environment in
perception (Gibson, 1986), but extends it to production.
