   Although the participants were told to complete all key
presses without hesitation or pauses once a response was
initiated, it is possible that the homogenous context might
have encouraged a strategic behavior in them to start the
first key press without having planned for the subsequent
keys. If this was the case, the duration of a response should
be longer in the homogeneous context than in the
heterogeneous context. Unfortunately, response durations
were not available to rule out this possibility. However, we
plotted cumulative response latency distributions for the two
conditions, following Damian and Stadthagen-Gonzalez
(2009). As Figure 1 shows, the differences between the two
distributions are relatively uniform across the entire
spectrum of response latencies, suggesting that the strategy
of immaturely starting responses on homogeneous trials was
not used by our participants. The similar distributions of the
two conditions also rule out the possibility that participants
were able to locate the first key and initiate a response on        Figure 2: Cumulative response latency distributions for the
