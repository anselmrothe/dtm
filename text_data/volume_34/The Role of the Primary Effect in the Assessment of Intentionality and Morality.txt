that secondary effects that play the role of means need to be

a new experiment with more similar scenarios. In
Experiment 2a we focused on intentionality assessment, in
Experiment 2b on morality judgment.
Design, Materials, and Procedure 142 subjects were
recruited and compensated as in Experiment 1a. The same
design as in Experiment 1a was used. Moreover, we used
the same side-effect scenarios except that we placed the
single worker inside a train to make his death appear less
cruel. Additionally, we made the means scenario less violent

The security vest was introduced to highlight the role of the
single victim as a necessary means. Without the vest one
might argue that the five are saved by the train, and the
single worker’s death is only a side effect. The procedure

used in Experiment 1a.
