distractor interference was present in the low load-low
dilution condition but not in the high load-high dilution
condition. However, in contrast to the predictions of the
Perceptual Load theory, no distractor interference was
observed in the low load-high dilution condition despite the
fact that latencies in this condition were as short as those of
the low load-low dilution condition. Benoni and Tsal (2010)
interpreted this finding as evidence that the perceptual load
effects reported in the literature previously are caused by
dilution.
   Although the Dilution account aspires to offer a more
concrete explanation of perceptual load effects than the
Perceptual Load theory itself, it is also somewhat vague in
some respects. For example, Benoni and Tsal (2010) argued
that dilution requires the mere presence of non-target letters
“...whose features are visually similar to those of the
distractor” (p.1293). It is not very clear what constitutes a
visually similar feature and how exactly a task can be
cateogorized as high-dilution or low-dilution. Benoni and
Tsal (2010) employed a low load task in which the target
was presented alone in the search array thus no dilution was
possible. However, Lavie and Cox (1997) have used a low
