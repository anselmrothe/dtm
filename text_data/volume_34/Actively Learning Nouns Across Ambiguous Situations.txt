we found two clusters, estimated by the optimum average
silhouette width (Kaufman & Rousseeuw, 1990). Cluster 1
contained 33 of the active training structures, and Cluster 2
contained the other 47. Figure 4 shows the trial-by-trial
average number of repeated pairs for each cluster. Although
people in both clusters initially repeat around one pair per
trial, learners in Cluster 1 soon began to repeat two or more
pairs on average, while those in Cluster 2 stayed closer to
one repeat, until the last few trials2. Overall, Cluster 1
repeated 1.9 pairs per trial, significantly more than Cluster
2’s mean of 1.1 repetitions (Welch t(60.7) = 9.09, p<.001).
From Figure 5, which shows how many pairs were repeated

Cluster 2 often chose to repeat single pairs until the very
