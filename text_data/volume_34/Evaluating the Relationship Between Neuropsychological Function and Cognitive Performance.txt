  Figure 1 shows median participant response times relative
to the presentation of the initial go stimulus across each of

task are stable across all blocks, showing no evidence of

  Beyond the 2AFC, the results for the change signal task
are generally consistent with those obtained in the Brown
and Braver (2005) experiment, and there are several features
that will be relevant for the rest of the analyses and
discussion that follows. First, note that the response times
for the change signal task are consistently much longer than
for the 2AFC, and that there is a wide disparity between the
change high and change low conditions. We will
demonstrate how these phenomena are related to the                       Figure 2: Reaction time as a function of change signal

for them to delay making a response once a change signal is
presented. In change trials, therefore, responses can be
initiated as soon as the change signal appears. Moore et al.
(2012) present a computational model demonstrating the
plausibility of this account.
   Another interesting feature in Figure 3 is that median
response times for change trials are faster in the high error
likelihood condition than in the low error likelihood
condition. To understand this average difference, it is
necessary to examine the details of human performance in
these cases and the characteristics of the task that give rise
to the observed results. Figure 4 shows the distribution of
response times for the change high and change low
conditions (left side), as well as the proportion of lapses in
each of the conditions (right side).
   Figure 4 illustrates that the difference in response times
between the two change conditions in Figure 3 is likely a
function of the 1000 ms lapse threshold. In the high error
likelihood condition, 15 % of the trials resulted in lapses
(see the right half of Figure 4), while only 1% of trials in the
low error likelihood condition resulted in lapses. The right
