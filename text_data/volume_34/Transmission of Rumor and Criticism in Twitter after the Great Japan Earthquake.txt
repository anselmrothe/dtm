transmission. The more important participants evaluated a
rumor, the more they intended to transmit it. This result is
congruent with the past studies showing that a positive
relationship of importance to transmission (see DiFonzo &
Bordia, 2007). Unlike the past work, in which the
relationship between importance and transmission did not
reach statistical significance (e.g., r = 0.12, p > 0.30 in
Rosnow et al., 1988), the current study found a strong
relationship between importance and transmission. This
relationship was found only in intended transmission, but
not in estimated transmission. Thus, participants
distinguished these two questions of transmission;
subjective importance of rumor had an effect on subjective
intension of transmission, not on expected behavior of
others.
