Abstract
The purpose of this study was to examine psychological
factors that affect the transmission of rumor and criticism in
social media during disasters. 40 students at Chiba University
evaluated 10 rumor tweets and corresponding 10 criticism
tweets that were posted in Twitter after the Japan March 11
Earthquake. Among some psychological factors, only
importance was related to intended transmission of rumor.
Surprisingly, accuracy and anxiety were not predictors of any
transmission. Estimated transmission of criticisms was higher
when its importance was high, while that of rumor did not
vary according to importance. Interestingly, although
participants estimated that criticisms were spread more than
rumor, they intended to transmit rumors as much as
criticisms.

Introduction
A 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit northeastern Japan on
March 11, 2011. The Great East Japan Earthquake triggered
powerful tsunami waves and a series of aftershocks, which
caused a devastating damage to the country.
During the disasters, social media played an important
role in obtaining and transmitting information to understand
the situation. An example is Twitter, which enables its users
to send and read text massages of up to 140 characters,
known as “tweets,” and to forward a message by re-tweeting
a tweet to followers through a single click.
Communications during disasters increasingly relies on
social media like Twitter. One reason is that social media
allow immediate and interactive information transmission.
This advantage, for example, led to the discovery and rescue
of some individuals who were isolated in a disaster area
after the Japan Earthquake. Although social media can play
an important role in sharing information and coordinating
disaster response, social media can also facilitate the
dissemination of false information, potentially creating
widespread panic. After the Japan Earthquake, for example,

Twitter was immediately filled with tweets about the
disaster that included not only useful information but also
false rumors (Ogiue, 2011; Tachiiri, 2011). The spread of
false rumors about the disaster became a major social
problem, and the Japanese government called attention to
false rumors on the Internet.
Given the growing use of social media in people’s
everyday life, cognitive science research needs to examine
how people process information using social media
technologies. This work contributes to this need by
analyzing the transmission of rumor and criticism in Twitter
after the Japan Earthquake. During disasters, factors such as
time pressure and psychological stress come into play, and
each individual’s decision and action can have significant
impact. For instance, the immediate and far-reaching spread
of false information can be detrimental. Thus, it is important
to study how users interact with information in social media.
Although Twitter is a new technology started in 2006, the
spread of false rumors during disasters is not a new
phenomenon (e.g., Prasad, 1935; Sinha, 1952). For example,
Prasad (1935) categorized rumors after the great Indian
earthquake of 1934. He found that the same types of rumors
about earthquakes appear again and again in different
locations during the past 1,000 years (Prasad, 1950).
Rumor study caught attention after World War II (see
Rosnow & Foster, 2005). Rumor was defined as “unverified
and instrumentally relevant information statements in
circulation that arise in contexts of ambiguity, danger, or
potential threat and that function to help people make sense
and manage risk” (DiFonzo & Bordia, 2007, p.13). It was
distinguished from gossip, defined as an evaluative
statement about someone’s private lives.
Past rumor studies revealed psychological factors that
affect rumor behavior, such as accuracy, anxiety, and
importance of rumors, and examined rumors in different
situations, including universities, organizations, and
communities (Anthony, 1973; DiFonzo & Bordia, 2000;
Rosnow, 1991; Rosnow, et al., 1988; Walker & Beckele,

2387

1987). However, few of the past work have examined
rumors in social media, which allow users to communicate
with a large number of people who are physically distant.
Thus, it is unclear whether we can apply the findings from
past studies to rumor transmission in Twitter.
In addition to the abundance of rumors in Twitter, we
noticed that many people tried to stop the spread of false
rumors by criticizing the rumor tweets. It was not only the
government and organization but also many individual
Twitter users who posted criticism tweets. A number of
studies have shown that refutation decreases the level of
belief in rumors (e.g., Allport & Postman, 1947; Bordia, et
al., 2000; Iyer & Debevec, 1991). Thus, criticism tweets
could minimize the impact of false rumors by making users
critical. Even if false rumors spread widely in Twitter, the
negative effect of false rumor would be curbed if criticisms
also spread. For this reason, examining how criticisms
spread in Twitter deserves attention.
In the current study, we examine the psychological factors
that affect rumor and criticism transmission using actual
tweets posted after the Japan Earthquake. Specifically, we
study whether perceived accuracy and importance of tweets
and anxiety arising from the tweets relate to the intended
and estimated transmission of the tweets.

questions within 50 minutes. The experiment consisted of
the four phases in the following order:
1. Rumor tweet Participants answered the following eight
questions about each rumor tweet: (1) Familiarity – Have
you heard this information? (Yes, No); (2) Anxiety – How
anxious did you feel when you heard this information? (1
Not at all, 7 Highly anxious); (3) Importance – How
important do you think this information is? (1 Not at all, 7
Highly important); (4) Intended receiver – Who should
know this information? (Family, Friend, Victims, Many
Japanese, Many people abroad, Anyone, Other); (5)
Intended transmission – How many people do you think
should know this information?; (6) Self-accuracy – How
accurate do you think this information is? (1 Not at all, 7
Highly accurate); (7) Estimated transmission – How many
people do you think have already known this information at
present?; (8) Others-accuracy – How accurate would others
think this information is? (1 Not at all, 7 Highly accurate).
Each tweet was presented in a random order.
2. Criticism tweet The design and procedure were the same
as those of the rumor tweet phase.
3. Demographic information There were demographic
questions and other questions about the degree of damage
experienced and familiarity with Twitter and media.
4. Debriefing Each participant was explained the purpose of
the experiment. It was emphasized that the tweets in the
experiment might be false, and that the spread of false
rumor was becoming a social problem after the disaster. In
addition, for further information, we recommended useful
books and websites that examined the false rumors related
to the disaster.

Method
Participants
Forty students (18 male, mean age 20 years) from Chiba
University in Japan participated for course credit. In
addition, they received a gift card in the amount of 500
Japanese yen (about $6.5). The experiment was conducted
from October 19 to November 1, 2011. Chiba University is
located in one of the areas affected by the disasters.

Stimuli
We collected 10 rumor tweets related to the disasters
following the Japan Earthquake and 10 criticism tweets that
criticized the corresponding rumor tweets (see Appendix).
Each tweet was posted in Japanese on Twitter between
March 11 and September 7, 2011. Each of the 20 tweets was
converted to a 700×162 pixels image in the PNG format
(see Figure 1). The user name associated with each tweet
was generated by randomly combining alphabet and number.
The image also contained the actual date when the original
tweet was posted. We created each criticism tweet by
adding the word “RT” (an abbreviation for Re-Tweet), the
user name of the corresponding rumor tweet, and part of the
rumor tweet to the criticism (see Figure 1, bottom). The
maximum number of characters in each tweet image was
140 in Japanese.

Results and Discussion
On average, the tweets we used were relatively unfamiliar to
the participants. The range of proportion of participants who
were familiar with 10 rumors was from 0% to 38% (M =
22.5%). That of 10 criticisms was 0% to 43% (M = 9.8%).

We removed outliers of intended and estimated
transmissions using the Smirnov-Grubbs test. Analyses
were repeated until no additional outliers were observed.
We examined the relationship between the four
psychological factors (self-accuracy, others-accuracy,
anxiety, and importance) and transmission (intended and
estimated). Each mean of these factors was shown in
Appendix. Table 1 shows Pearson’s coefficients of
correlation among these factors.
Self-accuracy and Others-accuracy Self-accuracy was
positively correlated with the other three psychological
factors: others-accuracy, anxiety, and importance (r = 0.62,
0.64, 0.80, p < .001, respectively) in the rumor condition. In
the criticism condition, it was positively correlated with
others-accuracy and importance (r = 0.79, 0.73, p < .001,
respectively), while it was not significantly correlated with
anxiety. The relationships between others-accuracy with the
other factors showed the same pattern as self-accuracy.
In order to examine the relationship between selfaccuracy and others-accuracy in detail, we performed a
repeated-measures ANOVA on accuracy rate as the
dependent variable, familiarity (familiar vs. unfamiliar) as
the between subject factor, tweet type (rumor vs. criticism),
and accuracy (self vs. others), as the within-subject factors.
All three main effects were significant (F (1, 796) = 24.7,
21.7, 70.3, respectively. p < .001): The familiar condition
(M = 4.8, SD = 1.7) were more accurate than the unfamiliar
condition (M = 4.2, SD = 1.7), the criticism condition (M =
4.7, SD = 1.5) were more accurate than the rumor condition
(M = 3.9, SD = 1.7), and others-accuracy (M = 4.6, SD =
1.4) was higher than self-accuracy (M = 4.0, SD = 1.8).
The interaction between tweet type and accuracy was also
significant (F (1, 796) = 66.3, p < .001, Figure 2). Simple
main effect of tweet type was significant only on selfaccuracy (F (1, 1592) = 61.7, p < .001): The rumor
condition (M = 3.4, SD = 1.8) was less accurate than the
criticism condition (M = 4.7, SD = 1.7). Simple main effect
of accuracy was significant only on rumor tweet (F (1, 796)
= 136.6, p < .001): Self-accuracy (M = 3.4, SD = 1.7)	  was
lower	  than others-accuracy (M = 4.5, SD = 1.5).
These results show that participants evaluated rumor
tweets less accurately than criticism tweets; however, they
estimated that others would evaluate rumor tweets as
accurate as criticism tweets. This result indicates that
participants think that they can detect unreliability of a

rumor tweet but that others cannot. There is a tendency for
participants to underestimate the ability of others to evaluate
accuracy of a rumor.

Figure 2: The analysis revealed that the bar of self-accuracy
in the rumor condition was lower than the other three bars.
Each bar shows the mean of 40 participants and 10 tweets.
Error bars represent standard errors.
Anxiety The means of anxiety in the rumor and the
criticism conditions were 4.0 (SD = 1.9) and 3.0 (SD = 1.8),
respectively. In the rumor condition, anxiety was positively
correlated with self-accuracy, others-accuracy, and
importance (r = 0.64, 0.35, 0.71, p < .001, p = 0.05, p <
.001, respectively). On the other hand, anxiety was
positively correlated with importance (r = 0.57, p < .001) in
the criticism condition, while there was no correlation
between anxiety and any accuracy. Thus, we found that the
more accurate participants perceived rumors were, the more
anxious they became. In contrast, anxiety was not correlated
with accuracy in criticism tweet. In other words, if a tweet
adopts a writing style in which it criticizes other tweet,
participants’ perceived accuracy of the tweet does not
influence anxiety.
The inconsistency in accuracy and anxiety between the
present study and past studies may be due to the differences
in the measurement of transmission. An index to measure
rumor transmission used in many studies was proportion
assessed by dividing the number of rumor passed along by
the number of rumor heard (e.g., Rosnow, et al., 1986;
Rosnow, et al., 1988; DiFonzo & Bordia, 2000). By contrast,
in the present work, the transmission was measured by
asking to how many people a participant intended to
transmit a rumor.

2389

Importance The means of importance in the rumor
condition and the criticism condition were 4.0 (SD = 1.9)
and 4.3 (SD = 1.9), respectively. Importance was positively
correlated with the other three psychological factors. It was
also positively correlated with intended transmission in the
rumor condition (r = 0.32, p = 0.04). On the other hand,
there was no significant correlation in criticism tweet.
Intended and Estimated Transmission Intended
transmission was correlated with no psychological factors
except for importance in the rumor condition. Estimated
transmission was not correlated with any psychological
factors. It was positively correlated only with intended
transmission in both the rumor condition and the criticism
condition (r = 0.31, 0.47, p = 0.05, 0.002, respectively).
The nonsignificant relationship between anxiety and
rumor transmission is inconsistent with the past finding that
anxiety was related to rumor spread (e.g., Anthony, 1992;
Jaeger, et al., 1980; Prasad, 1935; Pezzo & Beckstead, 2006;
Rosnow, et al., 1988; Walker and Beckerle, 1987). As the
mean anxiety of rumor in this study was approximately at
the center of the 7-point scale, it would be unlikely that we
observed a floor or ceiling effect as Pezzo & Beckstead
(2006) pointed out.
Of all psychological factors examined in the current study,
importance was the only factor that was related to rumor
transmission. The more important participants evaluated a
rumor, the more they intended to transmit it. This result is
congruent with the past studies showing that a positive
relationship of importance to transmission (see DiFonzo &
Bordia, 2007). Unlike the past work, in which the
relationship between importance and transmission did not
reach statistical significance (e.g., r = 0.12, p > 0.30 in
Rosnow et al., 1988), the current study found a strong
relationship between importance and transmission. This
relationship was found only in intended transmission, but
not in estimated transmission. Thus, participants
distinguished these two questions of transmission;
subjective importance of rumor had an effect on subjective
intension of transmission, not on expected behavior of
others.

to 4) and high importance (5 to 7). We performed this
classification in the rumor condition and the criticism
condition separately. There was no main effect of tweet type
on intended transmission as the dependent variable by
analysis of variance (ANOVA), with tweet type (rumor vs.
criticism) and importance (high vs. low) as the between
subject variables, F (1, 779) = 0.6, p = 0.4, while the main
effect of tweet type was significant on estimated
transmission as the dependent variable, F (1, 717) = 38.0, p
< .001: Estimated transmission rates in the criticism
condition (M = 1,036,225.4, SD = 2,789,937.5) were higher
than the rumor condition (M = 115,900.4, SD = 284,913.2).

Rumors vs. Criticisms
A tweet type (rumor vs. criticism) by transmission
(intended vs. estimated) analysis of variance was conduced,
with means of 10 tweets (Table 2) in each tweet type as a
dependent variable. The main effect of transmission was
significant, F (1, 40) = 16.7, p < .001: Intended transmission
was higher than estimated transmission. The main effect of
tweet type and interaction between two factors did not reach
statistical significance. This is, we think, because familiarity
in both rumor and criticism was very low. Approximately
only 16% of participants were familiar with the tweets.
Most tweets were new to participants, and, thus, they
estimated that a tweet had not been spread as much as they
wanted to transmit it.
As a next step, each response of intended transmission
and estimated transmission was classified into two
conditions according to importance rate: low importance (1

	  0	  

Figure 3: There was no significant difference between
rumors and criticisms on intended transmission, while the
two-way ANOVA on estimated transmission revealed the
interaction between tweet type and importance. Error bars
represent standard errors. 	 
The interaction between tweet type and importance was also
significant on estimated transmission	  F (1, 717) = 8.3, p =
.004 (see right four bars in Figure 3). The simple main effect
of importance was significant only in the criticism
condition, F (1, 375) = 10.4, p = 0.001: Estimated
transmission rate of the criticism condition was higher in

2390

high importance condition (M = 1,455,451.9, SD =
3,250,638.1) than low importance condition (M = 536,565.9,
SD = 2,011,841.9). There was no significant difference in
estimated transmission of the rumor condition between high
and low importance conditions. The simple main effect of
importance was significant on intended and estimated
transmission, F (1, 779) = 62.3, F (1, 717) = 11.4, p < .001,
respectively: transmission rate in importance high condition
(Intended transmission: M = 144,816.0, SD = 312,746.4,
Estimated transmission: M = 1,455,451.9, SD =
3,250,638.1) was higher than importance low condition
(Intended transmission: M = 94,578.9, SD = 261,279.8,
Estimated transmission: M = 536,565.9, SD = 2,011,841.9).
In intended transmission, there was no significant
difference between rumor and criticism tweet. Regardless of
tweet type, the more important a tweet was, the higher the
participants’ intended transmission was. This result shows a
simple relationship between importance and intended
transmission. On the other hand, importance had an effect
on estimated transmission by interacting with tweet type.
While the degree of importance of rumor tweets did not
influence on estimated transmission, that of criticism tweets
did influence on estimated transmission; the more important
a criticism tweet was, the higher the participants’ estimated
transmission was. These results show a discrepancy between
intended and estimated transmissions in terms of tweet type.
If people actually could transmit rumor and criticism as they
intended, rumor and criticism should be spread at the same
rate in Twitter. Thus, they should estimate a similar pattern
of transmission of rumor and criticism. However,
participants estimated that important criticisms were more
spread than important rumors. This may imply that
estimated transmission, in the present study, reflects	 
participants’ wish that criticisms should be shared more than
rumors.
With regard to criticism tweet, it was operationally
defined, in the current study, as a tweet that criticized a
rumor tweet by citing it. While accuracy of rumor was
correlated to anxiety, accuracy of criticisms was not
correlated to anxiety. This result indicates that accuracy of a
criticism does not increase anxiety. One interpretation is that
the perceived accuracy of criticisms reduces anxiety
compared to rumors. Similarly, Bordis, DiFonzo, & Haines
(2005) showed that rumor denials reduced anxiety by
interacting with personal relevance and source credibility.
Besides, criticism tweets were evaluated more accurate
and more important than rumor tweets. There are two
important points here. First, approximately 90% participants
were unfamiliar with the criticisms on average. Second,
participants were not given any strong evidence to show that
each criticism was truthful. Based on the definition of rumor
(DiFonzo & Bordia, 2007, p.13), the criticisms presented in
the current study are also considered a kind of rumor. In this
perspective, the difference between a criticism tweet and a
rumor tweet in this study was whether it adopts criticizing
form citing an original tweet. Why were criticism tweets
evaluated as more accurate and more important than rumor

tweets? One possible explanation is that, if a tweet has a
criticizing form citing an original tweet, the accuracy and
importance of the criticizing content are raised relatively to
the accuracy and importance of the cited original tweet.

Limitation and Future Research
The measurement of transmission is one limitation of this
study. In terms of ethical consideration, tweet transmission
was measured by asking intended and estimated
transmission instead of measuring how participants actually
spread tweets. The actual spread of tweet is also affected by
the number of follower a user has. Thus, even if a
participant intend to transmit a tweet to a few million
people, if the user has only a few follower, the tweet will
not be transmitted so much. We need to pay attention to the
difference between intended or estimated transmission and
actual transmission.
The order of rumor tweet and criticism tweet was fixed in
the current study: All participants were given rumor tweets
first, and then criticism tweets. Thus, the possibility, which
responses to criticism tweets were influenced by the
responses to rumor tweets, was not excluded. What if we
receive criticism tweets first? Do psychological responses to
criticisms help minimizing the spread of false rumor?
Further research is needed to examine this possibility by
comparing the experiment presented in the present study as
a condition with another conditions with the different order
of rumors and criticisms.

Conclusions
The major contributions of the present study were (1) to
reveal the relationship between psychological factors and
information transmission using real tweets posted after the
earthquake; and (2) to compare rumor tweet and criticism
tweet. As a general conclusion, perceived importance seems
to be a main predicator of tweet transmission. Better
understanding of users’ behavior through continued work in
this area can help the design and use of social media
systems, which in turn will help minimize the spread of
false information during disasters, and enhance people’s
social media literacy.
