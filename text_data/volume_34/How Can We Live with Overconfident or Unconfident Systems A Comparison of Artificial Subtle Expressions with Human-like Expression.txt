      form of a question, while the former stimulus (faster
      rate and falling intonation) informs them of a higher
      level of confidence.
     Linguistic condition: As another kind of typical
      human-like expressions, we prepared two stimuli by
      adding Japanese linguistic suffixes to the suggestions;
      that is, one with “desu (definitely)” 0.1 seconds after
      the suggestion, and the other with “dato omoi masu (I
      guess so).” We designed the suggestions with “dato
      omoi masu” to inform users of the system’s lower level
      of confidence, while the ones with “desu” to inform
      them of a higher level of confidence.
  Among the 20 trials, the navigation system expressed the
information with a higher level of confidence 10 times and
with a lower one 10 times. The order of these two levels of
confidence was counterbalanced across the participants.
