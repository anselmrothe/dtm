on people’s perception of the counterpart’s cooperativeness.
The hypothesis was that appraisal variables would mediate,
at least partially, the interpersonal effect of emotion (H3).
To further test the mediating role of appraisals, a second
experiment explicitly manipulated appraisals and measured
the effect on people’s perception of how cooperative the
counterpart was. The manipulation consisted of having the
agents, instead of showing facial displays of emotion,
express how they were appraising the outcome through text
(e.g., “I really don’t like this outcome and I blame you for
it”). The hypothesis was that, in line with reverse appraisal,
expression of appraisals would lead to effects on perception
of the counterpart’s cooperativeness that were consistent
with findings in the previous experiment (H4). This
experiment, thus, establishes the remaining link (ii, Figure
1) in the proposed causal model. Therefore, Experiments 1
and 2, together, provide experimental evidence for the
proposed model (Spencer, Zanna, & Fong, 2005).                            Figure 2: The emotion facial displays used in Experiment 1.
