Abstract
We investigate how the degree to which a context constrains
the words that could occur in a sentence affects the
processing of the word that does occur. Roland et al. (2012)
found that processing was facilitated when target words were
more semantically similar to word alternatives that could
have appeared. Because this effect is independent of word
predictability, it suggests that comprehenders may have
separate expectations for words and more general semantic
features. We show that the semantic similarity effect is
modulated by the degree of contextual constraint. We found
that facilitation due to semantic similarity was greater when
contexts were less constraining, and lower when contexts
were more constraining, independent of word predictability.
We interpret these results as suggesting that in highly
constraining contexts, comprehenders may expect specific
words, and face difficulties when these expectations are
violated, while in less constraining contexts, they may have
more general expectations for semantic properties shared
between the words that could occur.

Introduction
In expectation-based models of sentence comprehension,
contextual information has an enormous effect on how
words are integrated into sentences. These models predict
that the degree of difficulty a reader encounters in
integrating a new word into a sentence is either entirely or in
large measure a function of how predictable that word is
given prior context (e.g., Levy, 2008). Presumably this is
because predicted words are activated by context in advance
of when they are encountered, making them easier to
retrieve from memory or because predictable words are
easier to integrate into the representations being constructed
during comprehension. The effect of predictability on
processing time has been observed in many studies (e.g.,
Bicknell, Elman, Hare, McRae, & Kutas, 2010; Ehrlich &
Rayner, 1981; Frisson, Rayner, & Pickering, 2005; Staub,
2011; DeLong, Urbach, & Kutas, 2005; Federmeier,
Wlotko, De Ochoa-Dewald, & Kutas, 2007; Otten & Van
Berkum, 2008; Van Berkum, Brown, Zwitserlood,
Kooijman, & Hagoort, 2005).

The relationship between a word‚Äôs predictability and the
amount of effort required to process it has been formalized
in a number of computational models of language
processing known as surprisal models (e.g., Boston, Hale,
Patil, Kliegl, & Vasishth, 2008; Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008;
Pad√≥, Crocker, & Keller, 2009). In these models, the
amount of cognitive effort required to integrate a word into
a sentence depends on the negative log probability of that
word given its preceding context. Surprisal models have had
considerable success in predicting differences in reading
times based on a word‚Äôs predictability given its preceding
context.
As it turns out, the amount of processing effort associated
with integrating a word into a sentence cannot be entirely
reduced to its predictability given its preceding context.
Roland, Yun, Koenig, and Mauner (2012) examined the
effects of the semantic cohort of a target word (i.e., the other
words that could appear in the same position/context as the
target word) on the processing of a target word. They found
that words that are more semantically similar to their
semantic cohort are easier to process when word
predictability and other factors are controlled for. This result
is important because it points to a limitation in expectationbased computational accounts of sentence processing that
claim that a word‚Äôs probability given its context is the sole
predictor of processing effort (e.g., Levy, 2008). The results
we present further constrain expectation-based accounts of
sentence processing by showing that the effect of semantic
similarity between a target word and its semantic cohort
interacts with the degree of constraint provided by context.
The findings of Schwanenfluegel and LaCount (1988)
motivate the possibility that the benefits of semantic
similarity on word integration might be modulated by
contextual constraint. Schwanenflugel and LaCount found
that unpredictable words that were semantically related to
the most predictable word that could occur in the same
position were processed faster than other equally
unpredictable words that were also semantically unrelated to
that most predictable word. What is crucial for this
discussion is that the benefit of shared semantic information
was not consistently observed for all unpredictable words.
Shared semantic information only facilitated the processing
of unpredictable words when contexts were weakly
constraining.

To illustrate why the benefit of shared semantic similarity
to other words activated by the preceding context would be
greatest when a target word is unpredictable and its context
is only weakly constraining, consider the sentence contexts
in examples (1) and (2), for which we have obtained word
completions (this study will be described in greater detail
later).

Entropy as a measure of contextual constraint

0.05

In order to measure the effects of contextual constraint, we
need a measure to quantify the degree of contextual
constraint. Recall that in a more constraining context, there
are larger differences in the probabilities of cohort members,
because a small subset of the possible words is more likely,
while the others are unexpected. Alternatively, in a less
constraining context, there are a larger number of words that
are more or less equally likely. We will use Entropy (H), a
standard measure from information theory shown in
Equation 1, to reflect these differences in the distributions of
the probabilities the cohort members. Entropy is higher
when the choices are more similar in probability, as in low
constraint contexts, and is lower when choices are less
similar in probability, as in more highly constraining
contexts.

Hypotheses and Prediction
Based on the findings of Schwanenflugel and LaCount
(1988), we predict that the semantic similarity effect found
by Roland et al. (2012) will be stronger in more weakly
constraining contexts and weaker in highly constraining
contexts. While Schwanenflugel and LaCount only
examined the processing of unpredictable words, we do not
expect interactions with word predictability, since Roland et
al. found no interaction between similarity and
predictability.

constraint provided by the jabbing context is to note that the
top three items have a combined probability of .55. In the
attacking context, even the first 6 items do not match that
combined probability.

Figures 1a-b: Probability distributions for semantic cohorts
for Examples (1) and (2).
In both contexts, an instrument noun is most likely to be
the next word. However, the types of instruments in the
semantic cohort differed across contexts. For context (1),
instruments like sword, spear, stick, knife, and spike were
mentioned. These instruments share a typical property, i.e.,
all can be used as ‚Äúpokers‚Äù. In contrast, instruments like
sword, spear, knife, stick, fire, net, whip, and rock, which
were mentioned for context (2), have few salient
characteristics that are common to instruments of attacking.
This difference in the degree of shared characteristics
suggests that context (1) places greater restrictions on the
range of possible instruments than context (2). Using
responses obtained from a completion study, we illustrate
the distribution pattern of the probabilities of possible
instruments for each context. In comparing Figure 1a to
Figure 1b, two things become apparent. First, the most
probable instruments for jabbing are more likely than the
most probable instruments for attacking. Second, the
probabilities of the jabbing semantic cohort drop more
sharply than do the probabilities of the attacking semantic

Experiment to Generate Reading Times
Participants One hundred thirty native English-speaking
undergraduates from the University at Buffalo received
partial course credit for participation.
Materials We constructed 3 sets of 60 active declarative
sentences with optional prepositional phrases similar to
those in Example (3). Sets were differentiated by having an
instrument noun that was highly likely (e.g., sword),
moderately likely (e.g., spear), or unlikely (e.g., spike). To
avoid wrap-up effects on instrument reading times (Just &
Carpenter, 1980), all sentences included sentence-final
phrases like in the Colosseum. Presentation regions are
indicated in example (3) by vertical lines (|).

Selection of target instruments was based on responses from
a listing study in which 42 participants produced five
instruments for sentence fragments like (1) and (2). Cloze
probabilities for highly likely, moderately likely and
unlikely instruments were M = .23, S.D. = .06, M = .10, S.D.
= .04 and M = .02, S.D. = .01, respectively. Results of
plausibility rating revealed that all instruments were
plausible. Co-occurrence frequencies between target verbs
and instrument prepositional phrases, counted using the
British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 1995), were very
low (M = .03, S.D.= .03), and separate modeling showed
that the frequency with which each verb occurred with an
instrument phrase played no role in our results.	 ¬†
Experimental sentences were counterbalanced across six
presentation lists, each consisting of 10 experimental
sentences for each level of predictability. To obscure
systematicities, these sentences were intermixed with 90
distractor sentences with varied syntactic structures (e.g.,
subordinate clause, adverbial phrase, or relative-clause
sentences) and prepositional phrases with different
prepositions (e.g., on, in, or from). Finally, because
participants judged whether each sentence made sense, 33%
of the total number of trials were designed not to make
sense.
Procedure Participant-paced, region-by-region reading was
accompanied by a secondary make-sense judgment task.
This task was used to increase sensitivity to subtle semantic
effects that might not be observed in a straight reading
paradigm. Trials were divided into two blocks with a twominute break between blocks to lessen fatigue.
Dependent Variables 	 ¬†While the primary dependent
variable was the reading times for sentences that
participants continued to judge acceptable, we examined
‚ÄúNo‚Äù judgments to ensure that they did not differ as a
function of instrument likelihood. Across conditions,
percentages of ‚ÄúNo‚Äù responses adjusted for remaining
chances to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (see Boland, Tanenhaus & Garnsey,
1990) were low (under 5% in all conditions) and their
variances were small. ‚ÄúYes‚Äù reading times for instrument
noun phrases were filtered for outliers such that reading
times greater than 4,000 ms or less than 200 ms were
omitted. Filtering resulted in the removal of 27 of 3723
(0.7%) reading times.

Measuring Effects of Predictability, Semantic
Similarity, and Contextual Constraint
The goal of the modeling was to investigate how contextual
constraints modulated the effect of semantic similarity.
Reading times were submitted to a linear mixed-effects
model for analysis using the R statistics program (version
2.14.0, R Development Core Team, 2011) using lme4
(version 0.999375-42, Bates & Maechle, 2011). Fixed
factors consisting of Predictability, Similarity, Constraint,
Length, and Frequency, described in more detail below,
were used to predict reading time variances. Participants and

items were random factors. Fixed effects terms that did not
contribute significantly to the fit of the model, including all
4-way and 5-way interactions, were removed. We simplified
the initial fully crossed and fully specified random effects
structure to yield the maximally justified random effect
structure, as discussed by Jaeger (2009) and Baayen,
Davidson, and Bates (2008). Outliers with a standardized
residual at a distance greater than 2.5 standard deviations
from zero were removed (Baayen, 2008).

Model Predictors
Predictability We used log-transformed cloze probabilities
from the above-mentioned listing study to estimate
predictability. Each of the five responses was weighted by
its order of mention. If an instrument was a participant‚Äôs
first choice, it was weighted 5, if it was the second choice, it
was weighted 4, and so on.
Similarity We measured the degree of semantic similarity
between each target instrument and each member of its
semantic cohort (i.e., the other words produced in the
above-mentioned listing study) using Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA) cosines (Deerwester, Dumais, Furnas,
Landauer, & Harshman, 1990) with a semantic space
created from the BNC. LSA cosines were weighted by their
cohort-frequencies to determine the average semantic
similarity of a target instrument with its semantic cohort.
Average LSA cosines between targets and their semantic
cohorts ranged from .08 for the lowest similarity to .54 for
the highest similarity. Our measure of semantic similarity
differs from that used by Schwanenflugel and LaCount
(1988), in that they compared the target word with only the
most likely word, rather than with all of the words in the
semantic cohort. In addition, they used human similarity
judgments, while we used LSA cosines as a measure of
similarity.
Constraint We used the entropy of the probability
distribution of all possible instruments for a context to
measure the degree of constraint provided by the preceding
context. Entropy values ranged between 2.55 for the most
constraining contexts and 5.02 for the least constraining
contexts, with a mean of 3.88.
Length The lengths of instrument noun phrases were
included as an additional factor to control for any potential
reading time differences which might be due to this
perceptual factor. Length was measured in number of
characters, including spaces. Lengths ranged from 5 to 16
characters, with a mean of 8.36 characters.
Frequency We log-transformed the raw frequencies of the
head nouns of the instrument noun phrases, which were
obtained from the BNC. Base 10 log-transformed
frequencies ranged from 0 to 4.56 (i.e., occurring between 1
and ~36K times in the BNC), with a mean of 2.85. Because
frequency was correlated with Length (r = .65) and

	 ¬†

Predictability (r = .31), we residualized Frequency for
Length and Predictability, so that the predictors would only
reflect the component of frequency that did not overlap with
length and predictability. All other predictors had
correlations of less than 0.30.

Model Results and Discussion
We provide a summary of the linear mixed-effect regression
model in Table 1 and a graphical representation of the
interaction between Similarity and Constraint in Figure 2.
Length Longer words took longer to read. This is
consistent with previous findings showing the effects of
length (e.g., Juhasz & Rayner, 2003). Besides the
interactions discussed below, there was a 3-way interaction
between Length, Frequency, and Constraint. This was due to
length effects being larger for low constraint, low frequency
items and high constraint, high frequency items, and smaller
for low constraint, high frequency items and high constraint,
low frequency items. This possibly due to idiosyncrasies
within our items, since we did not attempt to make sure that
the same range of target word lengths were found in all
conditions.
Frequency Unsurprisingly, more frequent words were read
faster than less frequent words. This too is consistent with
previous studies (e.g., Ashby et al., 2005; Juhasz & Rayner,
2003; Kliegl, Grabner, Rolfs, & Engbert, 2004; Staub,
2011). Frequency interacted with a number of other
predictors as discussed below.
Predictability Consistent with many previous studies
(Ashby, Rayner, & Clifton, 2005; Bicknell et al., 2010;
DeLong et al., 2005; Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Federmeier et
al., 2007; Frisson et al., 2005; Otten & Van Berkum, 2008;
Rayner & Well, 1996; Staub, 2011; Van Berkum et al.,
2005), more predictable instruments were processed more
quickly.
There was a 3-way interaction between Predictability,
Frequency, and Constraint, as well as a 2-way interaction
between Predictability and Frequency, and a marginally
significant 2-way interaction between Predictability and
Constraint. These are due to low frequency unpredictable
words taking longer to read in low constraint contexts than
would be expected from the simple effects of frequency and
predictability (i.e., when all factors combine to give the
comprehender the least amount of help in predicting the
word). This may have resulted in the model underestimating
the reading times for low frequency unpredictable words in
low constraint contexts, giving the appearance of a lack of a
frequency effect for highly predictable words in low
constraint contexts.

Similarity Instruments were read faster when they were
more similar to the members of their semantic cohort than
when they were less similar. This result replicates Roland et
al.‚Äôs (2012) results. There was also a 3-way interaction
between Similarity, Frequency, and Length and a 2-way
interaction between Similarity and Length. These
interactions were due to the effect of similarity being larger
for longer words and smallest for short, high frequency
words. These are both consistent with the notion that
similarity effects are due to spreading activation during
processing, as the slower reading times for longer words
provide more chance for activation to spread between preactivated words, and short, fast words, being read quickly,
provide the least time.
Constraint There was no main effect of contextual
constraint. Importantly however, Constraint interacted with
Semantic Similarity, just as hypothesized. We analyzed this
interaction by performing separate analyses on the data
where one standard deviation was either added or subtracted
from the values for each of the predictors in the interaction
to create models reflecting low and high conditions for each
predictor, respectively (Aiken and West 1991). There was
an effect of Semantic Similarity when Entropy was high
(i.e., low constraint contexts) (Estimated coefficient = 500.28, S.E. = 103.43, t-value = -4.84), but no effect of
Semantic Similarity when entropy was low (i.e., high
constraint contexts) (Estimated coefficient = -34.14, S.E. =
85.70, t-value = -0.40). The estimated high and low reading
times are shown in Figure 2. The fact that Semantic
Similarity did not facilitate the integration of instruments in
strongly-constraining contexts is consistent with
Schwanenflugel and LaCount‚Äôs (1988) results. In addition,
there was a 3-way interaction between Similarity,
Constraint, and Length, with the similarity effects in the low
constraint conditions being larger for longer words than for
shorter words. Again, this is consistent with the notion that
the added reading times of longer words allows more time
for activation to spread between pre-activated words.

General Discussion
We found that semantic similarity between a target word
and its semantic cohort has a stronger effect on processing
when the context provides fewer constraints on what may
appear in the target position. Alternatively, the effects of
semantic similarity become weaker as the context becomes
more constraining. The effect of contextual constraint on the
degree to which semantic similarity affects processing has
important implications for models of processing. Roland et
al. (2012) suggested two possible causes for the semantic
similarity effect: spreading activation between the
representations for the words that comprehenders were
anticipating, and the possibility that expectations for words
and expectations for semantic features could have
independent effects on comprehension difficulty. Our
results suggest that the nature of comprehenders‚Äô
expectations may vary with the degree of contextual
constraint. In a highly constraining context (i.e., low
entropy), there is no effect of semantic similarity, and
comprehension difficulty appears to be primarily
determined by the predictability of the target word. If the
target word is expected, it is easy to process. If the target
word is unexpected, it is difficult to process.
On the other hand, in a less constraining context,
semantic similarity and predictability both influence
processing. Not only are more predictable words easier to
process, but so are words that are more similar to the other
members of the semantic cohort. Words are most difficult to
process when they are both unexpected and semantically
distant from their semantic cohort.
One possible explanation for why contextual constraint
modulates the influence of semantic similarity for
unpredictable words is that in a highly constraining context,
comprehenders may be expecting specific words, and face
difficulty when the expectations turn out to be wrong. In a
less constraining context, comprehenders may have less
specific expectations ‚Äì anticipating semantic features in
common between a set of possible words (in addition to, or
as an alternative to anticipating specific words). Thus, they
face less difficulty when the target word turns out to be
something other than the most likely word ‚Äì as long as the
target word shares some level of semantic similarity with
the other likely possible words. Overall, our data suggests
that word predictability, semantic similarity, and contextual
constraint all have an impact on language comprehension.
