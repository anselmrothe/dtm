   CRs are often formulated as CCs, as in (3) which is
particularly true where the syntactic category of the next
word was highly predictable (independently of lexical en-
tropy). Of the 72 CCs, 21 occurred in syntactically pre-
dictable (low POS entropy) conditions with 12 of these
also being CRs. Of the other 51 CCs, only 13 were also
CRs (57% vs. 25%; χ2(1) = 6.575, p = 0.010).
