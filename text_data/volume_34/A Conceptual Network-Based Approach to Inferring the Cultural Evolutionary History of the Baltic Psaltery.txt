each vertex (node) corresponds to an artifact, and an edge
implies that the extreme vertices of the edge are similar.
The edge is labelled by the similarity weight between the
two artifacts. The graphical representation of the similarity
graph can subsequently be interpreted as a historical pattern
of relationships amongst included artifacts. It is important
to emphasize that the similarity graph is not a cultural
phylogeny, but a mere representation of similarity among
artifacts: it does not incorporate explicit actual cultural
transmission models but provides an independent
framework for establishing historical hypotheses that can
corroborate or disagree with existing models of cultural
change. We restrict ourselves to the maximal similarity
graph, which connects each artifact to only those that have
the highest similarity to it (in most cases, for each artifact
there is only one most similar artifact). The maximal
similarity graph provides an approximation to the artifact’s
true cultural history.
