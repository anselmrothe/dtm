Furthermore, each chemical shared an occasional symptom

diagonally opposite quadrant. Symptoms from these classes
are denoted “ac” in the following.
   A single trial in the diagnostic task consisted of a
sequence of four symptoms, for example: Eyelid swelling,
Cough, Swoon, and Difficult Breathing (Ab_Ba_ac_Ba).
Note that in this example, the third symptom (a circulatory
problem) disambiguates the symptoms heard up to then and
leaves only “A” (the top left chemical in this example) as
the final diagnosis.
   Ten different item types were constructed that are listed in
Table 2. The point in the sequence at which a symptom in
combination with foregoing symptoms determined the final
