   EEG Analysis
   Peak amplitudes of the N170 in study and recognition
phases were examined for differences between the
experimental conditions. To improve the estimates of N170
amplitude and latency given the relatively small number of
ERP segments in each condition (leading to a low signal-to-
noise ratio), N170 extraction was aided by linear
decomposition of the EEG by means of Independent
Component Analysis (ICA, Bell &Sejnowski, 1995). ICA
was run separately for each subject using all scalp channels
and the entire dataset. For analyses of the recognition phase,
segments associated with incorrect responses were
discarded (there were no responses in the study phase). The
remaining EEG segments were averaged for every
participant and experimental condition. In each subject, we
identified ICA components that: (1) showed a deflection
