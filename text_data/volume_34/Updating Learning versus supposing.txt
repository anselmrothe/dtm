The Bayesian doctrine may also prove to be unsuited to sit-
uations in which the agent, albeit rational, loses track of her
position in time or space (Arntzenius, 2003). But the debate
about (1) might be of limited relevance to the typical transi-
tion from one probability distribution to another. Such tran-
sitions need not depend on adding an event B to one’s beliefs
without probabilistic qualification. Rather, experience might
lead us to revise our confidence in B without driving it to zero
or one. The rule proposed by Jeffrey (1983) is suited to this
kind of case. Recent work has begun to examine Jeffrey’s rule
from the psychological point of view (Over & Hadjichristidis,
2009; Zhao & Osherson, 2010).
