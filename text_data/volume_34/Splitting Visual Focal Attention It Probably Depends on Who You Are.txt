   However, there is a growing body of evidence which
supports the possibility of split attentional foci, or allocation
of attention to noncontiguous regions (for review, see Jans,
Peters, & De Weerd, 2010; cf. Cave, Bush & Taylor, 2010).
For instance, Awh and Pashler (2000) presented participants
with a 5 x 5 stimulus array and tasked them with identifying
two targets following the onset of cues (validity = 80%).
Results showed a strong accuracy advantage at cued
locations that did not apply to targets appearing between
cued locations, which suggest a divided focus of attention.
In their appraisal of the current literature, Cave, Bush and
Taylor (2010) concluded “the weight of evidence suggests
that some form of split attention is possible in some                   Figure 1. Predicted result trends, depending on mode of

Stimuli
   As far as possible, the stimuli, design, and procedure of
our experiment were kept in accordance with Experiment 1
of McCormick et al. (1998). While our participants
completed fewer trials, the proportion of trials for each
condition remained the same (see Table 1).
   The visual display comprised of a black background and
centered white fixation cross (0.4° by 0.4°). The cue used
was an empty white-bordered square (1.1° by 1.1°) which
appeared 10° to the immediate left of fixation, 10° to the
immediate right of fixation, or in both locations
simultaneously. The imperative stimulus was a white dot
positioned at one of four possible locations on the horizontal
median (10° left, 5° left, 5° right, or 10° right).

examined the simple main effect of target location at each
level of MMI. For the right cue condition, the simple main
effect of target location was significant for both High and
Low MMI participants, F(3, 96) = 87.68, p < .001, ŋp2 = .90
and F(3, 96) = 134.16, p < .001, ŋp2 = .81 respectively. For
the double cue condition, the simple main effect of target

F(3, 96) = 1.07, p = .36; but significant for High MMI
participants, F(3, 96) = 7.39, p < .001, ŋp2 = .19.
   This 3-way interaction is reflected in Figure 3. A distinct
RT gradient can be observed for both single cue conditions,
regardless of the MMI scores of participants: RT was fastest
at the cued location, and became slowed as the target was
presented further from the cue. For the double cue
condition, relatively constant RTs can be observed at each
target location for Low MMI participants. For High MMI
participants, a slight RT gradient can be observed between                                    High MMI
cued and irrelevant locations, with RTs being faster at cued
locations.
   As a further investigation of the 3-way interaction, and as
a planned comparison, we collapsed both single cue
conditions into one condition, and sorted the RT data by
trial type. Specifically, we analysed the RT difference
between valid trials, where the target appeared at cued
locations, and valid probe trials, where the target appeared
5° to the left or right of cued locations. The outcomes are as
follows:
   For the single cue condition, the effect of trial type was
significant regardless of the level of MMI. For both High
and Low MMI participants: RTs on valid trials (Low:
300ms, High: 306ms ) were significantly faster than those
on valid probe trials (342ms, 359ms), t(32) = 11.05, p <
