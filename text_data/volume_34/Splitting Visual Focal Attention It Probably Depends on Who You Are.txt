Abstract
Research evidence now suggests that the deployment of
multiple attentional foci in non-contiguous locations (i.e.,
splitting visual focal attention) is possible under some
circumstances. However, the exact circumstances under
which focal attention might ‘split’ have not been well
understood. The present study is the first in the literature to
examine the possibility that ecological differences arising
from our increasingly media-saturated environment may
result in individual differences in the capacity to demonstrate
splitting focal attention. Results suggest a significant
relationship between the behavioural preference for
consuming multiple media forms simultaneously and the
capacity to employ a split mode of attention.
Keywords: Ecological differences; splitting focal attention;
media multitasking

Introduction
In visual attention research, whether the focus of attention
can be divided is an issue of debate. Several authors espouse
the view that the focus of attention is unitary and indivisible
in nature (e.g. Eriksen & Yeh, 1985; McCormick & Klein,
1990; Pan & Eriksen, 1993). In order to account for the
processing of multiple visual stimuli in different spatial
locations, two different theories have been proposed. The
serial shifting theory of attention suggests that the focus of
attention rapidly shifts between different locations (Eriksen
& Eriksen, 1974; Posner, 1980), whereas the zoom lens
theory of attention suggests that the focus of attention is
adjusted in size to accommodate multiple locations (Eriksen
& St. James, 1986).
However, there is a growing body of evidence which
supports the possibility of split attentional foci, or allocation
of attention to noncontiguous regions (for review, see Jans,
Peters, & De Weerd, 2010; cf. Cave, Bush & Taylor, 2010).
For instance, Awh and Pashler (2000) presented participants
with a 5 x 5 stimulus array and tasked them with identifying
two targets following the onset of cues (validity = 80%).
Results showed a strong accuracy advantage at cued
locations that did not apply to targets appearing between
cued locations, which suggest a divided focus of attention.
In their appraisal of the current literature, Cave, Bush and
Taylor (2010) concluded “the weight of evidence suggests
that some form of split attention is possible in some
circumstances”.

With the focus on establishing the possibility of split
attention, there has been little research into the exact
circumstances under which split attention might arise. This
was the crux of a recent study by Lim and Lee (2011), who
hypothesized that adoption of a unitary or split mode of
attention could be a strategic choice made by the visual
system, depending on whichever was the least effortful
means of extracting target information from a particular
visual presentation. To test this, Lim and Lee employed a
modified version of the paradigm used in McCormick,
Klein and Johnston (1998).
In the double cue condition of the original study, boxes
10° to the left and right of a central fixation point were used
to cue the subsequent onset of a target dot. The target could
appear inside either box, or between a box and the central
fixation. Participants were tasked with responding to the
target once it appeared in their visual field. Results showed
that reaction times (RTs) for targets in cued locations (i.e. in
boxes) did not differ from those that appeared in irrelevant
locations (i.e. outside boxes), which was interpreted as
indicative of a unitary mode of attention (See Figure 1).
For their modified version of the double cue condition,
Lim and Lee introduced a vertical wall positioned in the
centre of the visual display with the intent of preventing a
single locus of attention from encompassing both boxes. It
was believed that this would incentivize a split mode of
attention and, in contrast with McCormick et al. (1998),
give rise to RTs for targets in irrelevant locations that were

attention employed in double cue condition (McCormick et
al., 1998).

slower than those in cued locations. Most intriguingly, while
results revealed the expected trend, this was regardless of
the presence or absence of the vertical wall. In other words,
participants showed the capacity to split attention for both
the experimental and control conditions – a contradiction of
McCormick and colleagues’ findings.
To explain this contradiction, Lim and Lee point towards
the 10-odd years that have passed between the two studies.
While this may not seem much in absolute terms, the 21st
century has seen an exponential increase in the prevalence
of digital devices in modern society. Compared to the
undergraduates of 1998, those in 2011 would have grown up
in a far more media-saturated environment with
simultaneous exposure to multiple rich streams of
information being a common occurrence (Ophir, Nass &
Wagner, 2009). Studies have shown cultural differences in
attentional phenomena such as change blindness (Masuda &
Nisbett, 2006), while learned visual experiences have been
known to result in differential allocations of visual attention
(Chun, 2000). In a similar vein, by demanding the allocation
of attention to multiple objects, today’s media-saturated
environment may encourage the development of the
capacity to split attention.
In our present study, we examine the suggested
relationship between media usage and splitting attention. To
this end, we borrow the Media Multitasking Index (MMI)
developed by Ophir et al. (2009), a measure of simultaneous
media usage. High and Low media multitaskers, as
indicated by the MMI, have been found to demonstrate
fundamental differences in cognitive control as well as
information processing approaches. We believe that similar
differences may be observed in the capacity to split attention
as well. Furthermore, to strengthen the case that the
contradiction between Lim and Lee (2010) and McCormick
et al. (1998) stems from ecological, rather than paradigm,
differences, we employed a close replication of
McCormick’s paradigm.
It is hypothesized that:
1. MMI should not result in between subject performance
differences for the single cue conditions. All
participants should demonstrate faster RTs for targets
that appear in cued locations, over those that appear in
irrelevant locations.
2. For the double cue condition, individuals who tend not
to media multitask, as indicated by their Low MMI
scores, should demonstrate unitary attention: RTs for
targets at cued and irrelevant locations should be
comparable;
3. However, individuals who tend to media multitask, as
indicated by their High MMI scores should
demonstrate split attention: RTs for targets at cued
locations should be significantly faster than for those at
irrelevant locations

Method
This research was conducted in two parts: a media use
questionnaire and matrix, followed by a cognitive
behavioral experiment.
Participants.
66 introductory psychology students participated for
course credit.
Media use questionnaire and matrix.
The questionnaire and matrix were close replications of
those employed in Ophir et al. (2009), with one slight
modification. Ophir and colleagues (2009) had included
items about non-visual media forms, such as music, in their
original study. Given that the present study is primarily
interested in the deployment of visual attention, all such
irrelevant items were removed. A decision was made to
retain the ‘Handphone’ item, as technological advances
have arguably transformed the handphone into a personal
digital assistant used for many functions other than for
phonecalls.
The questionnaire addressed 10 different media forms:
printed media, television, computer-based video (e.g.
YouTube), video or computer games, non-call related
mobile phone usage, online instant messaging, text
messaging, e-mail, web surfing, and other computer
applications (e.g. Word processor). Participants were
required to report the total number of hours spent per week
on each media form. Furthermore, participants filled up a 9
x 10 media-multitasking matrix, indicating the degree to
which, while engaged in one media form as a primary
activity, they would concurrently use other forms of media
as well (1 “Never”, to 4 “Most of the time”). Text
messaging was excluded as a primary media form in the
matrix as its usage could not be accurately described as a
function of time. However, it was still available as an option
under concurrent activities.
Deriving MMI
We recoded matrix responses as follows: 1 “Never” = 0, 2
= 0.33, 3 = 0.67, and 4 “Most of the time” = 1. Summing up
responses for each primary media form gave a measure of
the mean number of other media used concurrently for each
primary activity. Finally, to account for the different
amounts of time spent on each media form, MMI was
derived by calculating a sum of this measure across all
primary media forms, weighted by the percentage of time
spent on each primary media form. This process can be
summarized with the following formula:

where mi is the number of media typically used while using
primary media form i, hi is the number of hours per week
reportedly spent using primary media form i, and htotal is the

2571

total number of hours per week spent with all primary media
forms.
Stimuli
As far as possible, the stimuli, design, and procedure of
our experiment were kept in accordance with Experiment 1
of McCormick et al. (1998). While our participants
completed fewer trials, the proportion of trials for each
condition remained the same (see Table 1).
The visual display comprised of a black background and
centered white fixation cross (0.4° by 0.4°). The cue used
was an empty white-bordered square (1.1° by 1.1°) which
appeared 10° to the immediate left of fixation, 10° to the
immediate right of fixation, or in both locations
simultaneously. The imperative stimulus was a white dot
positioned at one of four possible locations on the horizontal
median (10° left, 5° left, 5° right, or 10° right).
Figure 2. Schematic of the sequence of a trial.
Design
The experiment used a 3x4 fully within factorial design.
The two independent variables were (1) type of cue: (a)
single box to the left, (b) single box to the right, and (c)
double box, and (2) location of target dot: (a) 10° left, (b) 5°
left, (c) 5° right and (d) 10° right.
Procedure
The sequence of events (see Figure 2 for schematic) for
each trial was as follows: the fixation cross was presented
for 800ms. This was followed by a single or double-box
cue. After a 515ms interval, the target dot was presented and
remained on screen along with the boxes until the
participant responded. Participants were instructed to press
the response key (spacebar) as soon as they detected the
target, but to refrain from responding when the target did
not appear (catch trials).
Participants were informed that the box cues indicated the
most likely location at which the target would appear, and to
orient their attention to these locations. Participants were
also informed that in the event of a double box cue, the
target could appear at either location with equal probability.
Participants were further instructed to attempt to divide their
attention between the two boxes when presented with a
double box cue.
Each participant took part in a single experiment session
consisting of 420 trials. Four rest periods were interspersed
during this session. The total number of trials for each cuetarget combination is presented in Table 1.

Results
Participant MMI scores ranged from 0.29 to 6.45, with an
average of 3.15 and standard deviation of 1.37. There was
no correlation between MMI score and the total number of
hours spent on surveyed media forms each week, r(64) =
.05, p = .67. In preparation for further main analyses,
participants with above-average MMI scores were classified
as High scorers, whereas those with below-average MMI
scores were considered Low scorers. Two groups of equal
numbers were obtained: 33 High versus 33 Low scorers.
Responses on catch trials were only extremely rare (2.2%
of catch trials), and no participants had to be excluded from
analysis on this basis. For each participant, trials with RTs
less than 150ms or in excess of 1000ms were regarded as
errors and not analyzed (less than 1% of trials).
A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
performed that included the variables cue type (left, right, or
double) and target location (10° left, 5° left, 5° right, or 10°
right) as within-subject variables, and MMI (high or low) as
a between-subject variable. Relevant means have been
summarized in Table 2.
The Mauchly’s test of sphericity was significant, p < .05,
for the cue type x target location interaction term,
suggesting that sphericity was violated. Accordingly, a more
stringent F-test (Greenhouse-Geisser) was used. Results
revealed a significant main effect for cue type, F(2, 128) =
235.84, p < .001, ŋp2 = .90. There was also a significant
main effect for target location, F(3, 192) = 34.44, p <.001,
ŋp2= .59. The main effect for MMI did not reach
significance, F(1, 64) = 3.19, p = .08. In terms of
interactions, the cue type x MMI interaction was nonsignificant, F(2, 128) = 0.99, p = .37. Both the cue type x
target location and target location x MMI interactions were
significant, F(6, 384) = 189.49, p < .001, ŋp2 = .90 and F(3,
192) = 4.66, p < .01, ŋp2 = .16 respectively.
Most important, all effects were qualified by a significant
cue type x target location x MMI interaction, F(6, 384) =
2.46, p < .05, ŋp2 = .21. Post-hoc tests revealed that the

target location x MMI interaction was non-significant for
the left cue condition, F(3, 192) = 2.36, p = .084, but
significant for the right and double cue conditions, F(3, 192)
= 3.40, p < .05, ŋp2 = .05 and F(3, 192) = 4.24, p = .01, ŋp2
= .22 respectively. The significant target location x MMI
interaction was examined individually for the right and
double cue conditions. To test my hypothesis directly, we
examined the simple main effect of target location at each
level of MMI. For the right cue condition, the simple main
effect of target location was significant for both High and
Low MMI participants, F(3, 96) = 87.68, p < .001, ŋp2 = .90
and F(3, 96) = 134.16, p < .001, ŋp2 = .81 respectively. For
the double cue condition, the simple main effect of target
location was non-significant for Low MMI participants,
F(3, 96) = 1.07, p = .36; but significant for High MMI
participants, F(3, 96) = 7.39, p < .001, ŋp2 = .19.
This 3-way interaction is reflected in Figure 3. A distinct
RT gradient can be observed for both single cue conditions,
regardless of the MMI scores of participants: RT was fastest
at the cued location, and became slowed as the target was
presented further from the cue. For the double cue
condition, relatively constant RTs can be observed at each
target location for Low MMI participants. For High MMI
participants, a slight RT gradient can be observed between
cued and irrelevant locations, with RTs being faster at cued
locations.
As a further investigation of the 3-way interaction, and as
a planned comparison, we collapsed both single cue
conditions into one condition, and sorted the RT data by
trial type. Specifically, we analysed the RT difference
between valid trials, where the target appeared at cued
locations, and valid probe trials, where the target appeared
5° to the left or right of cued locations. The outcomes are as
follows:
For the single cue condition, the effect of trial type was
significant regardless of the level of MMI. For both High
and Low MMI participants: RTs on valid trials (Low:
300ms, High: 306ms ) were significantly faster than those
on valid probe trials (342ms, 359ms), t(32) = 11.05, p <
.001 and t(32) = 14.33, p < .001 respectively (See Figure 4).
For the double cue condition, the effect of trial type was
non-significant for Low MMI participants: RTs on valid and

valid probe trials were comparable (306ms vs 308ms), t(32)
= 0.91, p = .37. In contrast, the effect of trial type was
significant for High MMI participants: RTs on valid trials
were faster than on valid probe trials (316ms vs 330ms),
t(32) = 4.84, p < .001 respectively (See Figure 5).

Discussion
The present experiment has replicated one of the central
findings in McCormick et al. (1998): Increasing RTs as
targets are presented further from cued locations in the
single cue conditions. This RT gradient has also been
observed in prior studies which used probes to test the
spatial extent of visual attention (e.g. LaBerge, 1983). Two
interpretations have been offered to explain this gradient.
Umiltà, Riggio, Dascola, and Rizzolatti (1991) proposed
that increasing RTs could reflect the need to shift attentional
focus, while McCormick and Klein (1990) suggested that
the gradient could reflect diminishing concentrations of
attentional resources at distances further from the cued
location.
McCormick et al. (1998) did not observe such a gradient
in their double cue condition. Accordingly, it was concluded
that either participants had no need to shift attention to
targets which appeared in irrelevant locations, or similar
levels of attention had been deployed across all four
potential target locations. Both interpretations are consistent
with the idea of a single attentional focus expanded to
encompass noncontiguous cued locations, as predicted by
the zoom lens model.

Consistent with McCormick and colleagues’ (1998)
findings, no RT gradient was observed in the double cue
condition for participants with Low MMI scores. RTs to
targets appearing at cued and irrelevant locations were
comparable. This suggests that a unitary mode of attention
was being employed by these participants.
In contrast, the critical finding in the present experiment
was the observation of an RT gradient in the double cue
condition for participants with High MMI scores. RTs to
targets at cued locations were faster than for those at
irrelevant locations. As elaborated above, this suggests that:
1) High MMI participants had to shift attention from cued
locations to attend to targets in the irrelevant region in
between, or 2) High MMI participants had deployed higher
concentrations of attention at cued locations, compared to
irrelevant locations. Both interpretations are consistent with
the idea of the deployment of two attentional foci in
noncontiguous locations – a demonstration of split attention.
Taking these results together, an interpretation based on
MMI variability seems to provide excellent insights into the
conditions under which split attention tends to occur, which
we elaborate below.
MMI is a measure of media multitasking behaviour. The
‘score’ obtained is an estimation of the number of media
forms a participant tends to concurrently use in a typical
hour of media consumption. Thus, the critical difference
between Low and High MMI participants is the behavioural
tendency to consume multiple visual media forms
simultaneously. Our results have established the following:
1. People who tend to consume multiple visual media
forms simultaneously, as indicated by High MMI
scores, employed a split mode of attention when
presented with cued noncontiguous locations.
2. People who tend to consume fewer visual media forms
simultaneously, as indicated by Low MMI scores,
employed a unitary mode of attention when presented
with the same.
This suggests a relationship between simultaneous media
usage and the capacity to split attention. If, as argued by
Lim and Lee (2011), ecological differences in terms of the
media-saturation of participants’ environments account for
the contradictory results between Lim and Lee (2011) and
McCormick et al. (1998), this further suggests that the
capacity to split attention ought to follow prolonged
simultaneous media usage, and not vice versa (however, this
remains an open empirical question at this juncture, as MMI
scores could not be experimentally manipulated to provide a
fuller claim).
How, then, might such a development take place? As
suggested in Lim and Lee (2011), the employment of a split
or unitary mode of attention could be a strategic decision
made by the visual system, depending on whichever was the
least effortful means of extracting information from a visual
representation. It has also been suggested that maintaining a
split mode of attention is inherently more effortful than
unitary attention, and leads to performance costs (Cave et
al., 2010). Pulling these trains of thought together, we

2574

propose that prolonged simultaneous media usage acts as a
form of practice which reduces the effort needed to maintain
split attention. This, in turn, increases the occasions where
split attention becomes strategically optimal, and thus
employed in lieu of unitary attention. A new direction for
future investigations would be to empirically test this
hypothesis through the use of training studies.
With respect to existing split attention literature, the
present study contributes to converging evidence which
suggests that the deployment of multiple attentional foci is
possible. Furthermore, the present study advances our
understanding of the conditions under which focal attention
might split. New evidence is presented, for the first time in
the literature, supporting the possibility of individual
differences in the capacity, or at least a tendency, to split
attention. Potential individual differences, which need not
necessarily stem from media multitasking behavior alone,
might at least in part explain the body of conflicting results
pointing to unitary attention. Prior attempts to reconcile
conflicting findings have typically focused on paradigm
differences (Dubois et al. 2009; Kramer & Hahn, 1995). A
full picture may only be achieved by considering the
interaction between individual and paradigm factors.
In addition, we wish to highlight that the present study
contributes to the general finding that ecological
experiences influence various visual attentional processes.
An interesting direction of future research would be to
explore the possibility of other ecological influences on the
capacity to split attention. One possible candidate is habitual
video game playing. Expert gamers are significantly better
at identifying targets presented towards the periphery of
their vision than non-gamers, which has been interpreted as
superior ability at distributing attentional resources
throughout the visual field (Green & Bavelier, 2003). Given
that split attention can be conceptualized as the ability to
deploy attention in a flexible manner, the attention
distribution benefits stemming from habitual game playing
might have an impact on the capacity to split attention as
well. This possibility is both a theoretically as well as an
empirically exciting one.
In conclusion, we report novel evidence that ecological
differences, arising from our increasingly media-saturated
environment and how we choose to interact with it, could
lead to individual differences in the capacity to demonstrate
split focal attention. This advances our understanding of the
exact conditions under which focal attention might split, and
might partly account for the conflicting evidence for and
against split attention found in the literature. Further studies
may consider other potential sources of individual
differences in the capacity to split attention. Moving
forward, we are very hopeful that ecological factors will
continue to shed new light on the persistent puzzle of
splitting visual focal attention.
