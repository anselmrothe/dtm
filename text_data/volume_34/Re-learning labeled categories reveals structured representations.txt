Procedure. On every trial, participants saw one object and
three possible labels (Figure 2). The starting position of the
cursor was equidistant from all response options and the
location of labels was randomly determined on every trial.
Participants were asked “Which category does this belong
in?” The object and labels remained on the screen until the
participant made a response. Afterward, feedback appeared
above the object for 1200 ms: “Correct [Incorrect]! This is
a _____.” Feedback included the correct label for all
responses. There was a 400 ms pause between trials.

These data suggest that learners may have successfully
represented more than object-to-label mappings for each
individual object and instead capitalized on structure among
objects. We discuss this idea further after considering
another interesting case of learning and re-learning.
     Study 2: Re-learning with related objects
The objects in Study 1 could be grouped into categories in
only by using the labels because the objects shared no
segments. How do people learn and re-learn related objects?
In what way(s) does similarity among objects influence
object grouping and impact re-learning?
   To examine these issues, we again used a category

objects with the goal of understanding how relearning is
influenced by the mapping between object similarity and
category labels.
