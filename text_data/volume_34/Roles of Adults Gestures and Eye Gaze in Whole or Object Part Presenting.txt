   In Analysis 1, we asked a caregiver to teach either a
whole object name or object part name and analyzed the
caregiver’s referential actions when she uttered either a
whole label or a part label. In Analysis 2, we compared the
caregiver’s eye gaze when she uttered labels in each
situation. If the caregiver used different referential actions
when she uttered a whole and a part label, and if they use
different eye gaze simultaneously with labeling whole or
part labels, it can be said that they actually provide different
nonlinguistic information for young children to help they
learn whole and part labels.

Nineteen pair of 4-year-olds (Mean=56.25 SD= 3.455
Range= 52-63 months) and their caregivers participated in
the experiment in the Greater Tokyo Area, Japan. This
experiment was conducted in conformity with a privacy
ethical code of Tokyo Denki University.
