processes can occur within a cognitive agent itself, or in
different agents within a group or society. Our larger goal in
this research is to study and model these micro-processes.
  In particular, we are focusing on the creative processes in
visual art. For this, one could consider the creative insights
spanning over the entire career of an artist (for example,
Dali 1993); or over a part of the career of an artist (for
example, Okada et al. 2009); or across several artists (for
example, Mace & Ward 2002). When a longer period is                                               Figure 1

the self-reflection data. In other words, we are relying on the
Artist’s own judgment of the novelty factor. We should
emphasize here that because of the nature of the task,
namely to connect the two pictures seamlessly, there were
many cases where the Artist copied elements, extended
texture, color or shape from one of the pictures to the
middle picture, and so on. Though we have included such
micro-processes in our complete analysis, they are not                                         Figure 2

Surface Similarity
In several instances, similarity with respect to color, shape
or texture played a key role in the genesis of the connecting
picture, and in such a way that a semantic construct was
created. This is illustrated by the following examples.
Similarity in shading or texture: Consider the Artist’s

I thought of a good way to solve this problem. In the

picture, I floated a number of clouds from 3 on the river.
