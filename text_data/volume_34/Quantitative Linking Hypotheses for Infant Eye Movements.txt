of infants, interactions among multiple cognitive processes,
and non-linear functions linking learning to looking.
   Infants in Wu & Kirkham’s (2010) study were simulated
in training and testing trials like those in their experiments.
Each simulated infant was exposed to four consecutive
blocks, each consisting of six training trials and a test trial.
On each training trial, objects appeared in two of the boxes
(top-left and bottom-right, or top-right and bottom-left), and
the lower box was cued. Each configuration of objects also
co-occurred with a unique sound. Each of the two
configurations occurred three times in each block of training
trials, and order was randomized within a block. After all
six training trials, infants saw one test trial where the screen
was empty, but one of the two sounds was heard. Simulated
infants then saw three more blocks, and each sound was
tested twice in random order across the four test trials.
