Figure 3: Empirical results and model predictions for the coin-tossing game. Columns represent separate experiments, with the empirical
data shown in the top row. The y-axis is the mean amount of blame subjects believe will be assigned to the player on the x-axis, by the other
player in the game. For example, in Experiment 1 subjects believe that Player 1 is assigned a 2.42 blame rating by Player 2, while Player 2 is
assigned a 3.56 blame rating by Player 1. In each sub-figure, the player on the left side of the x-axis is the one going first. For example, in
Experiment 1 Player 1 tosses the coin first. Model predictions are colored blue if they qualitatively match the ordinal blame judgments in the
empirical results, and are grey otherwise. The amount of blame predicted by the models is normalized. We set α = 0.7 in the above, but this
