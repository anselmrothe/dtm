similar findings on individuation tasks).
   There is also recent evidence by Deng and Sloutsky
(2012) who demonstrated that labels function the same way
as other features for young children, but they may become
category markers in the course of development. In
particular, Deng and Sloutsky used a variant of Yamauchi &
Markman’s (1998, 2000) paradigm and pitted category label
against a highly salient visual feature. They found that
unlike many adults who relied on category label, children
relied on the salient feature.
   If labels are not category markers for preschoolers, how
they can be category markers attracting attention to within-
category commonalities for infants (e.g., Balaban &
Waxman, 1997; Ferry, Hespos, & Waxman, 2010; Waxman
& Markow, 1995)? Although there is evidence that labels
do little above and beyond a silent condition (Robinson &             Figure 1. Prototypes of stimuli from Categories A and B.
Sloutsky, 2007), none of the studies claiming that labels are
category markers compared effects of labels with those of
highly salient visual features. How do labels affect (a)
patterns of attention and (b) the outcome of category
learning? And how do these effects differ from those of
highly salient visual features? The goal of this research is to
answer these questions by using a combination of eye
tracking and a more traditional novelty preference
paradigm.
               Overview of Current Study
The goal of the study reported here was to examine the role
of labels in category learning in infancy. The experiment
consisted of two between-subjects conditions: label-defined
condition and motion-defined condition. In both conditions,
infants were familiarized with the exemplars from one
category and then tested with the prototype of this category
and that of the contrast category. Infants saw the same
