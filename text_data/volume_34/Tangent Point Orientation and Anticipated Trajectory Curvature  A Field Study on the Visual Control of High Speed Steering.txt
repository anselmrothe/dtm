experienced drivers. Participants were recruited through
university e-mail lists, some through personal contacts
among students and staff. Condition for inclusion in the
experiment was normal uncorrected vision (qualified to
drive a car without correction) and sufficient driving
experience (>20 000km). All participants were naïve to the
purpose of the study (the tangent point hypothesis) and were
given two cinema tickets as compensation for participating.
All participants gave written informed consent, and the
study was approved by the local ethics committee.
                         Procedure
The test road was a 3.9 km low-standard two-lane rural road
with a low traffic density and no lane markings (5.4 m
pavement width). All drives were carried out in daylight.
Participants drove the car to the test route, which was
located 34 km from the campus. A few kilometers before
arriving at the test road, the instrument panel was occluded.
This was in done to reduce downwards glances to the

subjects. This distribution is shown by the histogram in
figure 3 (bottom), and shows that gaze is not equally distri-
buted on the road surface. This would happen if the drivers
were, for example, fixating a point on their trajectory that
would be some constant distance ahead. Instead, as shown
in the top half of figure 3, while they are approaching a turn
the drivers are looking further ahead – 100-150 meters up
the road in this instance – but as they enter the turn, the gaze
falls closer to the car. Also, when in a connected sequence
of turns, the gaze moves discontinuously on the road. Here,
the gaze is seen to jump further up the road (from right to
left) just before the vehicle yaw rate has reached its peak
and the left-hand part of the turn begins.
   An unexpected pattern became evident when the relative
frequency of estimated gaze landings in a specific part of
the curve was compared with yaw rate at that part of the
road (histogram in fig.3, bottom shows data for one curve).
