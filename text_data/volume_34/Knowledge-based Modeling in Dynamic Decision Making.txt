                         Evaluation
The connection weights of the decision net of MAIDEN-
DSF have been adjusted to model, as well as possible, the
behavior of a set of participants who performed the DSF.
The evaluation consists in the prediction of the behavior
of another set of participants in different conditions of
the DSF. The training and test data has been collected
from the DSF challenge (Lebiere et al., 2010) whose
homepage presents a wealth of information about the task
(http://www.hss.cmu.edu/departments/sds/ddmlab/modeldsf).
The measure used to evaluate the model fit was Pearson’s
linear correlation coefficient R, comparing the decisions of
the model and the participants over all 100 time periods. In
order to compute the decisions of MAIDEN-DSF, in each
time period the activation of the concepts of the perception,      Figure 3: Correlation between MAIDEN-DSF and human de-
