two best performing models are the DMSM and the minimal
networks model. The DMSM therefore accounts for Rips’
data as well as his own model despite requiring fewer free pa-
rameters. The DMSM performs better than the USM and the
mixed-strategy account, but recall that the DMSM has one
free parameter and the USM has no free parameters. Addi-
