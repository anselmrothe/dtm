precision in the visual and the cross-modal conditions was
substantially worse than that in the auditory condition the
same as the results in Experiment 1. The results suggested
that the performance of the cross-modal trials would lie
between that of the visual and auditory trials.
    In order to test how cross-modal comparison affected
the accuracy of numerosity comparison, we conducted a
one-sample t test to compare the mean of the PSEs of the
cross-modal condition 1 and that of the cross-modal
condition 2 with the PSE of 0, respectively. The mean of
PSEs in the cross-modal condition 1 was significantly larger
than 0 [t(4)=3.54, p < .05] and the mean of PSEs in the
cross-modal condition 2 was significantly smaller than 0
[t(4)=-5.43, p < .05]. The results showed that the number of
visual stimuli was overestimated relative to that of auditory
stimuli in both cross-modal conditions.	 
                         Discussion
    We investigated whether and how precision in
approximate numerical judgment between visual, auditory,
and cross-modal presentations would differ. Our results
demonstrated three significant findings. First, precision for
numerical comparison of auditory sequence was
significantly higher than that of visual sequence across two
standard numbers. Second, precision in the visual and the
cross-modal conditions was substantially worse than that in
the auditory condition. Third, the number of visual elements
was overestimated relative to that of auditory elements.
Taken together, our results imply the existence of modality-
