Abstract
Eye movements of twelve Caucasian participants were
measured whilst they performed a recognition test of
same (Caucasian) and other race (Indian) faces. We
observed a standard other-race effect, with more items
recognised correctly, fewer false alarms, and reduced
reaction time to same-race than other-race faces.
Additionally, a differential pattern of eye movements
between races emerged. During the study phase, samerace faces were fixated more than other-race faces,
whilst other-race faces resulted in a greater proportion
of fixations to internal face features than same-race
faces. At test, whilst no differences between races
emerged in the number of fixations or in the proportion
of fixations made to internal features, a significantly
greater level of fixations were made to the left
hemispace for other-race faces for both previously
studied and lure faces. These differences in the pattern
of fixation plausibly reflect the greater effort in the
processing of other-race than same-race faces.
Keywords: other-race effect, eye-tracking, face recognition,
same-race faces.

Introduction
The other-race effect refers to the phenomenon that
individuals are less proficient at recognising faces from a
different race to their own. This is typically characterised by
a ‘mirror effect’, whereby same-race faces attract a higher
proportion of hits and a lower proportion of false alarms
compared with other-race faces (Meissner & Brigham,
2001). As well as its theoretical importance, the other-race
effect has considerable practical significance. In particular,
it is well established that minority races in a community are
more likely to be wrongfully convicted of a crime on the
basis of erroneous eyewitness testimony (Meissner &
Brigham, 2001). For instance, Scheck, Neufeld, & Dwyer
(2000) found that most cases of mistaken eyewitness
identification in the United States were of Caucasian victims
misidentifying non-Caucasian suspects.
One explanation for the other-race effect is that
individuals process other-race faces in a qualitatively
different way to same-race faces. In particular, same-race
faces are believed to rely on configural processes to a
greater extent than other-race faces. Support for this comes

from the composite face effect (e.g., Michel, Rossion, Han,
Chung, & Caldara, 2006) in which recognition of the upper
half of a face was more disrupted by the bottom half of a
different face for same-race than other-race faces.
Furthermore, there is greater benefit for same-race than
other-race faces from the whole face context when
processing individual facial features (the whole/part effect,
e.g., Tanaka, Kiefer, & Bukarch, 2004). Additionally, there
is evidence that the face inversion effect is more pronounced
for same-race than other-race faces (Rhodes et al., 1989; but
see Valentine & Bruce, 1986). The greater exposure that
people typically have to same-race faces (e.g., Chiroro &
Valentine, 1995) may be one reason for the increased use of
configural processes (Gauthier & Tarr, 2002). Similarly,
perceptual learning (e.g., Gibson & Walk, 1956; McLaren &
Mackintosh, 2000) may lead to same-race faces being less
tightly clustered in multidimensional space than other-race
faces, resulting in easier discrimination of same-race faces
(as in “face-space” models, e.g., Byatt & Rhodes, 2004).
Eye movements provide an index to the allocation of
visual attention towards facial features (Findlay & Gilchrist,
2003). As such, the pattern of eye movements can provide
direct insight into cross-race processing differences. To
date, however, eye tracking has seldom been used to explore
the other-race effect. One exception is a study by Goldinger,
He, & Papesh (2009) which examined eye movements to
various features together with pupil dilation (an index of
mental processing load in visual attention) for Caucasian
and Asian faces, recruiting participants from both these
races. Both Caucasian and Asian participants fixated more
to same-race than other-race faces, and more to the eyes and
hair for same-race faces and more to the nose and mouth for
other-race faces. Pupil dilation was greatest for other-race
faces, indicating the recruitment of greater resources. A
separate study conducted by Blais, Jack, Scheepers, Fiset, &
Caldara (2008) found a slightly different pattern of results,
with Caucasians focussing on the eyes and East Asians
focusing on the nose and mouth, regardless of the race of
the faces viewed. As Goldinger et al. (2009) note, this
discrepancy may be partially due to the fact that in their
study they used faces with neutral emotions, whilst the faces
presented in Blais et al. (2008) varied in expression.
Our study directly examined differences in the processing
of internal features, relative to external features, for samerace compared to other-race faces. We also asked whether
there would be cross-race differences in fixation

1804

lateralization. These questions were not directly assessed by
Goldinger et al. (2009) but have been investigated in studies
tracking eye movements to famous/nonfamous faces (a
familiarity benefit similar to the same-race advantage has
been robustly established; see Johnston & Edmonds, 2009).
For instance, Althoff and Cohen (1999) found that a greater
proportion of fixations were delivered to nonfamous than
famous faces in fame and emotion judgment tasks.
Additionally, they showed that nonfamous faces evoked a
greater proportion of fixations to the left hemispace than
famous faces. Stacey, Walker, and Underwood (2005)
showed that famous faces resulted in greater internal
processing than nonfamous faces only under relatively
restricted conditions (a matching-faces task). These findings
are surprising given that behavioural work suggests that
internal features are more important for familiar than
unfamiliar face recognition (e.g., Ellis et al., 1979). Althoff
and Cohen (1999) suggested that the greater processing of
internal features for unfamiliar than familiar faces may
reflect the necessity for more efficient sampling of
information when viewing unfamiliar faces given that
internal features are particularly useful for identifying
people. They proposed a similar explanation for the greater
left hemispace bias for nonfamous than famous faces asymmetric viewing is more efficient due to the general
symmetry of faces.
Our predictions were somewhat open-ended due to the
lack of direct empirical investigation of these issues in the
context of the other-race effect. However, given that internal
features are regarded as more diagnostic and have greater
involvement in configural processing than external features,
more fixations to same-race than other-race faces would
provide an explanation for the same-race recognition
advantage. Nevertheless, this reasoning also applies to the
face familiarity effect, yet Althoff and Cohen (1999)
observed greater internal feature processing for nonfamous
than famous faces. On these grounds, if one assumes that
other-race faces can, on the whole, be regarded as less
familiar than same-race faces, a greater reliance on internal
features for other-race than same-race faces might be
anticipated. For similar reasons, the results of Althoff and
Cohen would suggest a greater reliance on left hemispace
processing for other-race than same-race faces.
Method
Participants
Twelve Caucasian students (3 males, 9 females) from the
University of Exeter, ranging in age from 18-39 (M = 22.92,
SD = 4.91) participated. No participants had visited Asia for
an extended period of time (i.e., over one month).
Participants were tested individually in a testing cubicle.
Apparatus
The experiment was run using E-Prime (Psychological
Software Tools, 2002) on a Dell PC with a 22-inch color
monitor and a standard computer keyboard. Participants sat
0.5 metres away from the screen.

The Eye link II system recorded movements in the right
eye using a video-based eye tracker with a head movement
compensation system connected to a Dell PC with a 17-inch
TFT monitor. Eye movements were sampled on the
recording computer at 500Hz. Pupil position was monitored
via a miniature infrared CCD video camera mounted on an
adjustable headband. The display computer initiated and
terminated eye tracking recording on each trial.
Stimuli
Stimuli consisted of forty colour photographs of male
faces. Twenty Caucasian (taken from O’Toole et al., 2005)
and twenty Indian faces (taken from Jain & Mukherjee,
2002) were used. All faces were full-face view, had neutral
expressions, and no distinctive features (e.g., glasses, facial
hair). Images were of comparable quality. Pictures were
edited using Adobe Photoshop to achieve a resolution of
300-pixels wide; the height was constrained by the natural
proportions of the face (average: 370.3-pixels). Faces were
cropped, to remove the background of the image. The
resulting images were presented centrally on a white
background on a screen with a resolution of 800x600 pixels.
Procedure
Our basic procedure was modeled on Experiment 2 of
Stacey et al. (2005) with the difference that we manipulated
the race of the faces rather than their familiarity. In the
study phase, twenty faces were presented. Ten of these faces
were Caucasian and ten Indian. Trials began with a black
fixation cross for 500ms, followed by a blank screen for
500ms. A face was then presented for 5 seconds. No
response was required but participants were instructed to
remember the faces.
After a break of around 2 minutes, the test phase began.
Here, forty faces were presented: the twenty studied faces
(ten Caucasian, ten Indian) and twenty “lure” faces (ten
Caucasian, ten Indian) which had not previously been seen.
Faces were presented in a random order. Trials began with a
black fixation cross lasting 500ms, followed by a blank
screen for 500ms. A face was then displayed for 5 seconds.
During this time, participants indicated whether they had
seen the face previously (by pressing z on the keyboard) or
if the face was new (by pressing m). If participants did not
answer in time, no response was recorded and participants
were encouraged to respond quicker.
In both the study and test phases, stimuli were presented in
a random order. Eye movements were recorded in both
phases, with corrections for drift conducted every 5 trials.
Analysis
Eye Movements
Eye movements were analysed using EyeLink Data
Viewer Software, which automatically detects saccadic eye
movements and analyses these movements into individual
fixations using a combined position/velocity/acceleration
criterion (a saccade was defined as a period where eye
velocity was greater than 30º/sec, eye acceleration was

Results
Behavioural Results
Test Phase
A paired-samples t-test revealed that the hit rate for
studied faces was significantly higher for same-race
(Caucasian; M = .85, SD = .14) than other-race (Indian; M =
.70, SD = .18) faces, t(11) = 2.51, p = .029. Furthermore, the
false alarm rate was higher for other-race (M = .35, SD =
.18) than same-race (M = .08, SD = .08) faces, t(11) = 5.75,
p <.001. Response time was significantly higher for otherrace (M = 1697.22, SD = 478.65) than same-race (M =
1407.15; SD = 376.43) faces, t(11) = 3.08, p = .011. Time
outs were minimal (on .004 of trials).
Eye movement data
Study Phase
Descriptive data of the pattern of eye-movement across
the entire 5000ms study period is displayed in Table 1.

Paired-samples t-tests revealed that more fixations were
made to internal than external features for both same-race,
t(11) = 7.83, p < .001, and other-race, t(11) = 9.51, p <
.001, faces. An additional paired-samples t-test, combining
both internal and external features, showed that participants
made significantly more fixations to same-race (M = 15.13;
SD = 3.71) than other-race (M = 14.33; SD = 3.68) faces,
t(11) = 2.78, p = .018.
Table 1

the entire Study Period.

Due to the significant difference between groups in terms
of the mean number of fixations, we calculated the mean
proportion of fixations to internal features (internal features/
[internal features + external features]). Next, we divided the
study interval into five separate 1000ms time bins to better
characterise differences in the processing of other-race and
same-race faces over time. This information is displayed in
Figure 2. We then conducted a within-subject ANOVA with
two factors, race (same-race and other-race) and time
interval (0-1000ms, 1001-2000ms, 2001-3000ms, 30014000ms, and 4001-5000ms) to investigate this data. This
yielded a significant effect of race, F(1,11) = 14.994, p =
.003, η2p = .577, with the proportion of fixations to internal
features significantly greater for other-race than same-race
faces. There was, however, no significant effect of time
interval, F (4,44) = .723, p = .581, η2p = .062, and no
significant interaction between time period and race, F
(4,44), = .070, p = .991, η2p = .006, indicating that the main
effect of race remained consistent across time.

Fixations

greater than 8000º/sec2 and the eye had deviated at least 0.1º
from its starting position). Fixations were defined as periods
between saccades. Blink artefacts were automatically
removed from the data.
Eye movements were analysed for the entire stimulus
presentation period in the study phase. In the test phase, eye
movements were analysed up until participants made their
response. Using the EyeLink Data Viewer Software, Region
of Interests (ROI) were created for internal (i.e., eyes, nose
and mouth) and external (e.g., hair, ears) features.
Furthermore, ROIs were created for the left and right
hemispaces (including both internal and external features).
ROIs were drawn separately for each face (c.f., Figure 1).
The size of the ROI’s between races was closely
comparable. Fixations falling outside of the ROIs were
excluded from subsequent analyses. In the analyses
reported, for ease of exposition, we focus on the pattern of
fixations; dwell measures showed a similar pattern.

We calculated the mean proportion of fixations to the left
hemispace (left hemispace/[left hemispace + right

1806

showed that fixations to the left hemispace did not differ
from 0.5 (chance) for either same-race (M = .53; SD = .16),
t(11) = .67, p = .52, or other-race (M = .56; SD = .16), t(11)

proportion of fixations to the left hemispace across the study
interval for both same-race and other-race faces. A withinsubject ANOVA with two factors, race (other-race, same
race) and time interval (0-1000ms, 1001-2000ms, 20013000ms, 3001-4000ms, and 4001-5000ms) revealed that
there was no significant effect of race, F(1,11) = 2.171, p =
.169, η2p = .165. There was, however, a significant effect of
time interval, F(1,11) = 5.783, p = .001, η2p = .345, with the
proportion of fixations to the left hemispace decreasing
across the study period. Furthermore, there was also a
significant interaction between race and time interval,
F(4,44) = 3.321, p = .018, η2p = .232. T-tests, assessing the
nature of this interaction, indicated that other-race faces had
a significantly greater proportion of fixations to the left
hemispace than same-race faces for the first 1000ms time
bin, t(11) = 2.702, p = .021, but that there were no
differences between face type for the other time periods (all

The mean proportion of fixations to the left hemispace for
both studied and lure same-race and other-race faces are
shown in Table 2. One sample t-tests showed that fixations
to the left hemispace were reliably greater than chance (0.5)
for both studied, t(11) = 2.551, p = .027, and lure, t(11) =
2.960, p = .013, other-race faces. There was no significant
asymmetry, however, for either studied, t(11) = 1.200, p =
.256, or lure, t(11) = .768, p = .459 same-race faces. In
terms of the proportion of fixations made to the left
hemispace, a 2x2 within-subject ANOVA, yielded no
significant main effect of presentation type (studied, lure), F
(1,11) = .980, p = .344, η2p = .082, and no significant
interaction between face type and race, F(1,11) = .148, p =
.708, η2p = .013, but there was a significant main effect of
race, F(1,11) = 8.619, p = .014, η2p = .439. Paired-samples ttests revealed that the effect of race was significant for both
studied, t (11) = 2.404, p = .035 and lure, t(11) = 2.274, p =
.044, faces with a greater proportion of fixations to the left
hemispace for other-race than same-race faces.

Test Phase
Descriptive data for the test phase are shown in Table 2.
As in the study phase, paired-samples t-tests revealed that
there were no differences between same-race and other race
faces for either studied, t = 1.399, p = .189, or lure faces,
t(11) = .466, p = .651. There were more internal than
external fixations for both “seen”, t(11) = 10.46, p < .001,
and “new”, t(11) = 8.16, p < .001, same-race faces;
similarly, there were more internal than external fixations
for “seen”, t(11) = 8.37, p < .001, and “new”, t(11) = 9.63, p
< .001, other-race faces.
As for the study phase, we calculated the mean proportion
of fixations to the internal features. Unlike in the study
phase, however, we did not partition the fixations into time
intervals due to differences both within and between
participants in the time spent viewing the faces. Table 2
shows the mean proportion of fixations to internal features
for both other-race and same-race faces for both studied and
lure faces. A 2x2 within subject ANOVA, with the factors

Discussion
We investigated the pattern of fixations of Caucasian
participants while they performed a recognition task on a
group of Caucasian (same-race) and Indian (other-race)
faces. Consistent with previous studies, we found evidence
for a “mirror-effect” (Meissner & Brigham, 2001);
participants had fewer hits (recognising “seen” faces), more
false alarms (incorrectly recognising “new” faces), and a
longer response time for other-race than same-race faces.
In the study phase, we found, consistent with Goldinger et
al. (2009), that participants made more fixations to samerace than other-race faces. Additionally, participants made a
greater proportion of fixations to internal features for otherrace than same-race faces. We divided the study period into
five time periods to examine whether the nature of this
effect changed over time. However, there was no indication
of a time x face type interaction, which indicates that this

1807

effect remained consistent throughout the study period. We
also directly examined the lateralization of the fixations that
participants made to same-race and other-race faces. Whilst
there was no overall effect of race type, there was a
significant effect of time with fixations becoming more
equally divided between the left and right hemispace over
time. Furthermore, we also found that there was a
significant interaction between race and time, with a greater
proportion of fixations made to the left hemispace for otherrace than same-race faces for the first 1000ms time interval
but not for the remaining four time intervals.
At test, stimuli were divided into those seen in the study
phase, and “lure” stimuli which were only presented at test.
For both types of faces there was no difference in the
proportion of internal fixations to same-race or other-race
faces. However, there was a significant effect of race for
both studied and lure faces in terms of the proportion of
fixations made to the left hemispace. Specifically, we
observed a greater left hemispace bias for other-race than
same-race faces.
The demonstration in the study phase that a greater
proportion of fixations were made to internal features for
other-race faces than same-race faces is consistent with
previous work (e.g., Goldinger et al., 2009). In this regard,
an explanation similar to that proposed by Althoff and
Cohen (1999) to account for the greater proportion of
internal fixations to nonfamous than famous faces seems
applicable to our results. Specifically, Althoff and Cohen
(1999) argued that there was greater need to effectively
process the internal features, which are critical to face
recognition, for nonfamous than famous faces. Our finding
may, therefore, be due to the less efficient extraction of the
internal features for other-race than same-race faces. The
fact that participants made fewer fixations to other-race than
same-race faces whilst trying to remember them supports
the assumption that other-race face information is processed
less easily (see also Goldinger et al., 2009). The more
efficient processing of internal feature information for samerace faces would, consequently, provide greater opportunity
to focus on external feature information, which still has
informational value for recognition. This explanation is also
consistent with Goldinger et al. (2009) who found greater
pupil dilation for other-race than same-race faces, indicating
greater processing effort for other-race faces.
Given this, it is striking that the internal feature bias for
other-race races appears relatively transient – this effect did
not come close to reaching significance in the test phase.
One might have reasonably expected a greater reliance on
the more diagnostic internal features would also have been
present in the test phase where the behavioural differences
between same-race and other-race faces emerged. Instead,
the effect was only detectable when participants were
explicitly asked to encode the stimuli rather than when the
requirement was to retrieve the stimuli. As such, this pattern
of findings is in line with the idea that the greater bias to
internal features for other-race than same-race faces reflects
an encoding related perceptual process rather than a

retrieval-based process (for related behavioural evidence see
Lindsay, Jack, & Christian, 1991; Tanaka et al., 2004; but
see also Papesh, & Goldinger, 2009).
One caveat to the idea that the internal feature bias for
other-race than same-race faces reflects an encoding rather
than a retrieval process is that, as is common in face
recognition studies (e.g., Goldinger et al., 2009; Stacey et
al., 2005) the same picture of each face was shown at both
study and test. This may have increased the reliance on
pictorial codes during recognition rather than structural
(abstracted memory representations) codes (Longmore, Liu,
& Young, 2008), which are assumed to underlie face
recognition outside the lab. This may, therefore, account for
the difference between phases rather than the differing
requirements of the study and test phases. However, as
Longmore et al. (2008) note, if recognition was purely
picture based, one might have expected equivalent
recognition performance on other-race and same-race faces
which was not the case in our study. Nevertheless, this
potential issue could be addressed in future work by
showing different photographs at study and test.
The pattern of fixations across the study and test phases
was somewhat different to the internal feature effect. In the
study phase, there was evidence of a greater bias to the left
hemispace for other-race faces on first viewing the stimuli
but this effect was not detectable over the remainder of the
study period. In contrast, we found a left hemsipace bias for
other-race than same-race faces for both studied and lure
faces in the test phase. Broadly speaking, therefore, these
results indicate a greater lateralization asymmetry for otherrace than same-race faces which was most marked in the
test phase than the study phase. This may reflect that whilst
the internal features effect appears to be due to encoding
processes, the lateralization effect may reflect retrieval
processes and is present only in the initial stages of
encoding the stimuli. The demonstration that a greater
proportion of fixations were made to the left hemispace for
other-race than same-race faces during recognition is again
similar to Althoff and Cohen’s (1999) finding of greater left
hemispace viewing for nonfamous than famous faces. This
finding can also be explained by postulating greater
processing requirements for other-race than same-race faces.
Under high processing demands, it appears efficient to focus
primarily on the most diagnostic regions. This would mean
a greater focus on one side of the face, given that faces are
generally symmetrical (Althoff & Cohen proposed a similar
explanation). We note that the limitations that Althoff and
Cohen identified in their study concerning assessment of
laterality effects (e.g., possible differences in texture or
luminance between sides) similarly apply to our experiment.
Future work could assess the generality of our effect by
flipping one half of the face in a counterbalanced design
such as in Rhodes (1985).
Previous work indicates that familiarity effects in face
processing are influenced by task demands (Stacey et al.,
2005). Our findings should, therefore, be generalised to
different paradigms as well as to different races. Future

1808

work should also include participants from different races to
investigate cross-over interactions between recognition
performance and the race of the participants. This would
ensure that our findings are due to differences in cross-race
face processing rather than factors such as the properties of
the stimuli themselves. One issue with this sort of study,
however, is that due to the extensive media exposure to
Caucasian faces which means such faces are highly familiar
to most populations, it might be preferable to carry out
follow-up cross-over studies with non-Caucasian races.
Nevertheless, our findings provide compelling evidence for
processing differences between same-race and other-race
faces. They also indicate that there may be overlap in the
processes that underlie the same-race benefit and the
familiarity advantage. Much remains to be understood, and
this study should only be seen as a first step, but we hope
that our experiment will help motivate future eye tracking
work in this important area.
