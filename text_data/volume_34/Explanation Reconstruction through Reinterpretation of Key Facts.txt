Abstract
Reconstructing explanations is crucial for the progress of science. We focused on the transition of interest in a key fact
that contradicts the preceding explanation and has a central
role in its reconstruction. We used a short story as an experimental material in which the participants first constructed a
naı̈ve explanation and reconstructed it. First, when the naı̈ve
explanation was rejected, a new explanation was required, after interest in the key fact was inhibited. Second, hypothesized premises not inconsistent with the naı̈ve explanation
were sought to protect the naı̈ve explanation. Third, interest
in the key fact was recovered through the process of the explanation reconstruction. Last, we facilitated the explanation
reconstruction by having the participants focus on the key fact.
Keywords: eye movement analysis; scientific explanation;
key fact; insight; naı̈ve concept.

Introduction
Scientific activities aim to understand the world by two ways:
descriptive and explanative (Simon, 2000). Descriptive understanding grasps the nature and characteristics of phenomena by observations and experiments; explanative understanding grasp the mechanisms behind the phenomena and
the reasons why such phenomena appear.
Through the history of science, descriptive understanding
is usually established first and then explanative understanding is investigated. For example, Keplar’s law described the
orbit of the planets, and then Newton’s law explained why
they moved in such orbits. Science has developed while pursuing such explanative understanding about phenomena. The
construction of explanations is crucial for science.
As historical facts, we can confirm many cases where
the explanation for a certain phenomenon was completely
changed because the structures of the explanation and the
concepts of objects were essentially shifted. Such cases are
generally observed in the history of science: e.g., the shift
from the caloric theory to the oxygen theory and the transition from Newton’s traditional theory to Einstein’s relative
theory.
As an example, consider the change of the caloric theory
to the oxygen theory. Initially, in the caloric theory, burning was explained as the release of caloric. After an inconsistency was observed about the caloric theory, the weight
increase after burning, a new explanation was required. In
the current study, we call such an instance that contradicts a
preceding explanation and must be interpreted by a new explanation a “key fact.” The change of the explanation from
the caloric theory, i.e., burning released caloric, to the oxygen theory, i.e., burning is connected with oxygen, was es-

tablished by reinterpreting the key fact, i.e., the increase of
weight by burning.
Note that there are two ways of understanding a key fact.
One is by local modification and slight expansion of a previous explanation. The other is understanding by an essential
change of a previous explanation. An interpretation about
key facts completely changes between the two types of understanding: a completely different interpretation about a key
fact is given in each of the two theories. In the oxygen theory,
the key fact is explained by the connection with oxygen, but
in the caloric theory, it is explained by the release of phlogiston that has negative weight.
Difficulties exist in such essential reconstruction of explanations. Interesting processes are often observed that prevent
such reconstruction. One is the stubborn refusal to abandon
explanations. People prefer to protect an established explanation by modifying and adding new reservations than shifting to a new one. In such a case, to protect the old explanation, people may focus on other irrelevant facts and arbitrarily proposed premises that are not inconsistent with the
previous explanation. They sometimes add secondary explanations as protection. For example, in the caloric theory, a
premise, phlogiston might have negative weight, was hypothesized and investigated.
Now we summarize the problems we address in this paper.
We investigate a situation in which fact F that cannot be interpreted by explanation A is observed, and new explanation
B is required. For the transition from explanation A to B, a
mental leap is needed, meaning that fact F must be reinterpreted. We call fact F a key fact and investigate how it is
processed through a reconstruction of the explanation.
The research questions and hypotheses are drawn in the
following. We hypothesize that reinterpretation of key facts is
crucial for the transition to a new explanation. However, people tend to pursue unrelated facts or arbitrarily hypothesized
premises to protect old explanations, and such reinterpretation of key facts may be postponed. As a result, the interest
in key facts is inhibited, and the reconstruction of explanation
is impeded.
We propose two hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1 When a previous explanation is rejected and a
new explanation is required, interest in a key fact may be
temporarily inhibited.
Hypothesis 2 With the inhibition of interest in a key fact,
other facts and hypothesized premises that are not inconsistent with a previous explanation are searched for, and

the old explanation is protected.
We are also interested in the transition process from a former to a new explanation. We confirm that the reinterpretation of a key fact has a central role in the transition of the
explanation. Two additional hypotheses are drawn.
Hypothesis 3 The recovery of interest in a key fact is observed through the process of the explanation reconstruction.
Hypothesis 4 We may promote explanation reconstruction
by having participants focus on a key fact.

Concern for a key fact
We used a short story as an experimental material because
people understand a text by unifying meanings while adding
implicit information and inferences about omitted and unpresented sentences (Rumelhart & Ortony, 1977; Seifert &
Robertson, 1985).
We used a text that was modified from a barber task
(Gardner, 1978). Figure 1 shows the material. In this material, (1) a naı̈ve explanation is initially constructed by a key
fact; (2) a new explanation is required where a shift of perspective is needed; (3) a rational explanation is constructed
by reinterpreting the key fact.
In the story, in a town with only two barbershops, a character is looking for a barber and must to select either barber A whose staff has unkept hair or barber B whose staff’s
hair is beautifully cut. Initially, participants may select barber
B where the following naı̈ve explanation is given: “a barber
with beautiful hair is very skilled.” However, a new explanation is required after being informed that the character selected barber A. The fact, “barber A’s hair is messy and barber
B’s hair is neat,” contradicts the initial explanation. Therefore, in the story, the key fact that must be reinterpreted is:

“barber A’s staff has unkept hair and barber B’s staff has neat
hair.” The reconstructed explanation from Gardner (1978) is:
“each does the other’s hair because there are only two shops
in town; therefore, barber A’s staff who did barber B’s staff’s
hair is more skilled.” In the reconstructed explanation, the key
fact becomes evidence for selecting barber A but in the naı̈ve
explanation, it is evidence for selecting barber B. The meaning of the key fact has completely shifted with the transition
from the initial to the reconstructed explanation.
In the text, other unrelated facts than the key fact are described; therefore, other secondary additional explanations
may be possible to protect the initial naı̈ve explanation. However, if participants construct such an explanation based on
other facts than the key facts, the contradiction remains unsolved: the character selects a messy barber. The shift to the
reconstructed explanation by reinterpreting the key fact is required for consistently understanding the story structure.

Experiment 1
We confirmed the validity of the barber’s story as an experimental task to examine our hypotheses. Experiment 1
confirmed whether most participants initially constructed the
naı̈ve explanation. Additionally, to confirm Hypothesis 2 preliminary, participants reconstructed their explanations after
the naı̈ve explanation was rejected.
The definitions of the naı̈ve and reconstructed explanations
are described below.
Naı̈ve explanation A barber who has beautiful hair is very
skilled.
Reconstructed explanation Each does the other’s hair because there are only two shops in the town; therefore, barber A’s staff who did barber B’s staff’s neat hair is more
skilled.

Twenty-one undergraduate students participated in the experiment.

Procedure

Task

Experiment 1 was constructed of two phases: the initial explanation phase and the reconstruction phase. In the initial
explanation phase, the participants read the story while thinking about which barbershop to select and their task was to
construct an explanation for their decision. The initial explanation phase was followed by the reconstruction phase in
which the naı̈ve explanation was rejected, and they were required to reconstruct their explanation of the story.

The story was displayed on a computer screen. The filler (barbershop) part of the text (Figure 1) was removed due to limitations of the display size.

Results
Forty four of the 53 participants initially constructed the naı̈ve
explanation. A binomial test revealed that they primarily constructed naı̈ve explanations (two-sided: p < .01). Moreover,
the reconstructed explanations by the 44 participants were
classified into four types (Table 1). Three other explanations than the reconstructed explanation were based on such
facts about place as “shop B is located near the repair shop,”
and about time such as “shop B is open until late,” and hypothetical information not included in the story. A chi-square
test revealed a significant difference in the numbers of these
explanations (χ2 (3) = 10.8, p < .05), and a multiple comparison using Ryan’s method showed that the explanations based
on place and time were constructed significantly more than
the reconstructed explanation (p < .01, p < .01).

These results confirmed the validity of the barber task as
an experimental task for our study. Additionally, we confirmed that the participants tended to add secondary explanations based on the facts about place and time to protect the
naı̈ve explanation, preliminarily supporting Hypothesis 2.

Experiment 2
We confirmed both the inhibition of interest in the key fact
(Hypothesis 1) and resumption of interest (Hypothesis 3) us-

Procedure
The experiment was conducted individually, and participant
eye movements were recorded using a Tobii T60 eye tracker.
As in Experiment 1, in the initial explanation phase, the
participants were required to explain the story. Their fixation
ratios of the key fact during the initial explanation phase were
used as the baseline for analysis of the subsequent reconstruction phase. The fixation ratio of each fact was normalized by
the number of letters that were included in each part.
After the initial explanation phase, the participants were
reconstructed their explanations as answers to a quiz. When
the participants found an idea, they reported it. They did the
experiment at their own pace. When they gave another explanation than the reconstructed explanation as the target, they
were told that it was not correct and were told to reconsider.
This phase was continued for 30 minutes; when each participant constructed the reconstructed explanation, it was terminated.

Results
Inhibition of fixation on key fact To examine the inhibition of interest in the key fact after the naı̈ve explanation was
rejected, we analyzed the fixation ratio of the key fact part in
the initial stage of the reconstruction phase. First, we examined whether the fixation ratio of the key fact was less than
the baseline obtained in the initial explanation phase and the
other facts (place and time).
Figure 2 shows the fixation ratio of each of the facts (place,
key, and time) during the first minute and the subsequent
minute in the reconstruction phase.
In the first minute (0–60 sec), a t-test indicated no significant differences between the fixation ratio of the key fact and
the baseline (t(20) = 1.62, n.s.). A one-way ANOVA showed
a significant main effect of the three facts (place, key, and
time) (F(2, 40) = 8.97, p < .001), and a multiple comparison
using Ryan’s method showed that the fixation ratio of the fact
about place was significantly higher than those of the key fact
and the fact about time (p < .05, p < .05).
Next, we conducted the same analysis on the subsequent
minute (60–120 sec). A t-test indicated a significant difference between the fixation ratio of the key fact and the baseline (t(20) = 2.86, p < .01). A one-way ANOVA showed
a significant main effect of the three facts (place, key, and
time) (F(2, 40) = 4.36, p < .05), and a multiple comparison

using Ryan’s method showed that the fixation ratio of the
key fact was significantly lower than the place and time facts
(p < .05, p < .05).
In the subsequent minute, we confirmed that the fixation
ratio of the key fact was significantly lower than the baseline
and the place and time facts. These results support that interest in the key fact was inhibited when the naı̈ve explanation
was rejected.
On the other hand, in the first minute, our prediction was
not observed; the fixation ratio of the fact about place was
substantially higher. This result might be affected by the order of the three facts, which were arranged as place, key, and
time (see Figure 1). The participants probably read the story
in this order, reflecting the result in the first minute.
The overall results of Experiment 2 supported Hypothesis 1.

Procedure

Resumption of fixation on key fact Next, we analyzed the
process of recovering interest in the key fact to build reconstructed explanation (Hypothesis 3). We focused on the 11
of 21 participants who successfully constructed the reconstructed explanation and analyzed the transition process of
their fixation ratio of the key fact part.
Figure 3 shows the transition with the progress of three
phases: the first 60 seconds, the last 60 seconds before reaching the reconstructed explanation, and the residual between
them.
A one-way ANOVA showed an significant main effect of
the three phases (F(2, 20) = 7.62, p < .005), and a multiple
comparison using Ryan’s method showed that the fixation ratio of the key fact in the last phase was significantly higher
than those in the first and middle phases (p < .05, p < .05).
The interest in the key fact gradually improved even though
the ratio in the middle phase was not greater than in the first
phase, partially supporting Hypothesis 3.

This experiment was conducted in small groups on personal
computers for the stimulus presentation and data acquisition.
The participants were divided into two experimental conditions: highlighted (21 participants) and non-highlighted (20
participants). In the highlighted condition, the key fact was
colored red to facilitate interest in it; the participants were instructed that the highlighted sentences were crucial for finding the right explanation. There was no such highlight in the
non-highlighted condition.
In the initial explanation phase, the participants constructed explanations about the story as in Experiments 1 and
2. Then, in the reconstruction phase, they were also required
to reconstruct their explanations and report them by computer
keyboard. After reporting their explanations, they received a
message: “since there is another reasonable explanation acceptable to all, please reconsider.” They were told that there
was an evaluator in another room connected by the Internet,
even thought no such evaluator existed, and the same message
was always returned. The maximum time of the reconstruction phase was 15 minutes, and the data were analyzed until
they reached reconstructed explanations.

Discussions and Conclusions
In our study, we focused on reinterpretation of a key fact for
explanation reconstructions and examined the inhibition of
interest in it and the improvement of interest in it by eyemovement analysis. The following is a summary of our experiment.

• In such a situation, other facts and hypothesized premises
not inconsistent with the naı̈ve explanation were searched
for and focused on, and the naı̈ve explanation was protected(Hypothesis 2 was supported).

Next, we analyzed the facts to which the participants referred until they reached the reconstructed explanation in the
reconstruction phase. The referenced facts were identified by
their description about the explanations. The ratio of each of
the referenced facts in the generated explanations is shown in
Figure 4.
A two-way ANOVA was conducted with the experimental
conditions (highlighted and non-highlighted) as a betweenparticipant factor and the facts (place, key, and time) as a
within-participant factor. There was neither a significant
main effect of the experimental conditions nor of the facts
(F(1, 33) = .16, n.s.; F(2, 66) = 1.15, n.s.), but there was significant interaction between the conditions and the facts
(F(2, 66) = 8.55, p < .001). A multiple comparison using
Ryan’s method showed differences between the highlighted
and non-highlighted conditions of the key and place facts
(p < .05, p < .05). There were also significant differences
between the key and place facts in the highlighted condition
(p < .05), and the key fact and the place and time facts in the
non-highlighted condition (p < .05, p < .05).
These results suggest that the participants in the highlighted condition attempted to reinterpret the key fact. On
the other hand, in the non-highlighted condition, there was
little mention of the key fact. When there was no facilitation
of interest in the key fact, the participants tended to modify
their explanation based on other facts, supporting Hypothesis 2 that was preliminary supported in Experiment 1.

Finally, the ratios of the accumulated number of the participants who reached the reconstructed explanation in the
reconstruction phase are shown in Figure 5. A chi-square
test showed significant differences between the two experimental conditions at 10 and 15 minutes (χ2 (1) = 6.26, p <
.05; χ2 (1) = 7.79, p < .01).
These results indicate that enhancing interest in the key fact
facilitated the reconstruction of the naı̈ve explanation, and

• Interest in the key fact was recovered through the process
of the explanation reconstruction, especially before reaching the solution (Hypothesis 3 was partially supported).
• We facilitated the explanation reconstruction by having the
participants focus on the key fact (Hypothesis 4 was supported).
In studies of hypothesis generation and testing, some human biases have been confirmed. For example, confirmation
bias gathers positive instances to confirm hypotheses (Wason,
1960), and established hypotheses are maintained against
anomalous data (Chinn & Brewer, 1998; Mason, 2001).

In the educational psychology domain, it has also been
confirmed that naı̈ve concepts that are not supported by related evidences are held strongly (McCloskey, Washburn, &
Felch, 1983; Watts & Zylberstan, 1981). Watts and Zylberstan (1981) studied junior high-school students’ naı̈ve concepts about the inertia law and concluded that even if they received accurate knowledge about the law from lectures, they
repeated the naı̈ve explanation for events related to it.
In our experiments, we set up an experimental situation
in which the participants reconstructed the naı̈ve explanation.
Theories in scientific activities were established based on the
accumulated results of experiments through history in which
the fixation to an explanation may be much stronger. Note
that similar phenomena were observed using a short story in
the laboratory setting of our current study.
The situation requiring a shift in explanations in our experiments seems similar to the settings dealt with in studies of insight problem solving. Here, mental constraints arising from
the perceptual features of a problem and past experiences create an impasse and prevent problem solvers from finding the
new relations required to solve the problem. These mental
constraints are gradually relaxed unconsciously in some cases
even if problem solvers meet an impasse, where they often
ignore key evidence that leads to a solution. With activities
that do not follow these mental constraints and acceptance of
such crucial instances for solutions, problem solvers gradually reach a solution (Knoblich, Ohlsson, Haider, & Rhenius,
1999; Knoblich, Ohlsson, & Raney, 2001; Ohlsson, 1992;
Terai & Miwa, 2003). In our experiment, we also observed
such a recovery process that of focused on key facts.
It is difficult to manage interest in facts without the influence of hypotheses and concepts that were previously constructed (Kaplan & Simon, 1990; Luchins & Luchins, 1950;
Wason, 1960). For example, Bilalic, McLeod, and Gobet
(2008) used a rule discovery task that required participants
to search for a better solution than the one they had already
found. Their study indicated that the participants were unconsciously prevented from searching for facts that were unrelated to the existing solution, even if they were instructed
to seek alternatives. This result also indicates that human behavior is largely constrained by constructed hypotheses and
concepts.
In Experiment 3 of our study, even though we controlled
the participant interest in the key fact that contradicted the
naı̈ve explanation by highlighting it, there was no significant difference between the highlighted and non-highlighted
conditions during the first five minutes. Moreover, only half
of the participants constructed the reconstructed explanation,
even if such external stimuli were given. This suggests that
the inhibition of interest in the key fact that contradicted the
naı̈ve explanation remained even after deep consideration for
15 minutes. We must study the interaction between conscious
and unconscious activities by combining verbal protocols and
eye movement analysis to understand the process of shifting
explanations in more detail.
