Abstract

combinations are “highly recalcitrant to compositional
semantic analysis”.
Here, we take a novel approach to this debate, by providing a mathematical test which determines whether
a conceptual combination can be considered compositionally, or not. We start with a consideration of what
compositionality might mean probabilistically.

The question of under what conditions conceptual representation is compositional remains debatable within
cognitive science. This paper proposes a well developed mathematical apparatus for a probabilistic representation of concepts, drawing upon methods developed in quantum theory to propose a formal test that
can determine whether a specific conceptual combination is compositional, or not. This test examines a joint
probability distribution modeling the combination, asking whether or not it is factorizable. Empirical studies
indicate that some combinations should be considered
non-compositionally.

Probabilistic Models of Compositionality

Conceptual Representation
Within cognitive science, the question of how to represent concepts is still being debated. Different positions
have been put forward (e.g. the prototype view, the exemplar view, theory theory view), and Murphy (2002)
contrasts some of these positions. He asks which is most
supported by the various aspects of cognition related to
conceptual processing, but concludes somewhat disappointingly, that “there is no clear, dominant winner”.
Here, we take the position that it is possible to progress
by asking a broader question about the nature of concepts; can they always be modeled compositionally? Or
do they sometimes take a non-compositional form?
Some arguments for compositionality center around
the systematicity and productivity of language; there are
infinitely many expressions in natural language and yet
our cognitive resources are finite. Compositionality ensures that this infinity of expressions can be processed,
as it allows an arbitrary expression to be understood
in terms of its constituent parts. Since compositionality is what explains systematicity and productivity,
Fodor (1998) claimed that concepts must be compositional, however, this is at odds with prototypicality effects (Frixione & Lieto, [In Press]; Fodor, 1998). For
example, consider the by now well known conceptual
combination PET FISH. A “guppy” is not prototypical
PET, nor a prototypical FISH, and yet a “guppy” is a
very prototypical PET FISH (Hampton, 1997). Therefore, the prototype of PET FISH cannot result from the
composition of the prototypes of PET and FISH, and
so the characterization of concepts in prototypical terms
is difficult to reconcile with compositionality (Hampton,
1997; Fodor, 1998). This supports a view put forward
by Weiskopf (2007) when he observed that conceptual

Figure 1 represents a basic probabilistic scenario involving a ‘black box’ composed of two proposed subsystems,
A and B. What would it mean if this system was declared to be compositional? Acknowledging that it is the
experiments which can be performed upon this system
(and their likely outcomes) that will define this notion
allows us to move beyond philosophy and into the realms
of a mathematical definition.

Figure 1: A potentially compositional system, consisting
of two identifiable sub-components A and B. The system
can perhaps be understood in terms of a mutually exclusive choice of experiments upon those sub-components,
one represented by the random variables A1, A2 (pertaining to an interaction between the experimenter and
component A), and the other by B1, B2 (pertaining to
an interaction between the experimenter and component
B). Each of these experiments can return a value of ±1,
representing yes and no.
We define a compositional system as one which can
be validly decomposed in such a manner that different
experiments can be carried out upon each of its subsystems, and that these will answer a set of ‘questions’
regardless of the experimental behavior of any other subsystems. For the sake of simplicity, we shall assume that
the answers to these questions are binary, they might be
termed ‘yes’ and ‘no’, but are for generality labeled as +1
and −1.1 Standard probabilistic reasoning suggests that

This assumption is more reasonable than it might at first
appear: it is always possible to break a complex question

it is possible to describe this behavior in terms of four
random variables representing the bivalent outcomes:
{A1, A2, B1, B2}. What analysis can be brought to
bear upon such a situation? As with many systems, the
outcomes of our experiments will have a statistical distribution over all available outcomes, and it is possible
to develop a set of probabilistic arguments about this
scenario. For example, it is possible to consider the joint
probability Pr(A1, A2, B1, B2) describing the likely behavior of our experimental black box, however, this very
formulation forces us to consider what exactly a noncompositional probability distribution would look like.
This paper is devoted to answering this question, but
in order to approach the answer, we must first provide a
model of non-compositional behavior, and this is not an
easy task; almost all of our mathematical formalisms are
based upon a notion of compositionality (Kitto, 2008).
However, one mathematical model is widely accepted as
non-compositional, Quantum Theory (QT), and so we
take this formalism as the basis of our formulation of
non-compositional behavior. Our reasons for this choice
will become clearer from a psychological perspective as
our argument progresses.

Senses and Concepts
Our model takes Gärdenfors (2000) conceptual space as
its starting point, extending this notion through the use
of a vector space representation of concepts. For the purposes of this paper, we shall construct this representation
through reference to the word association networks and
vocabulary of the human mental lexicon, although this
is not a necessary step for the formalism proposed; any
sensible vector space construct would suffice if it has a
similar structure to that discussed below. The UniverAssociate

of each concept into a sport sense (highlighted in bold),
and an animal sense.
sity of South Florida (USF) word association data maps
the strength of word associations displayed by a large
sample of psychology students over a period of 30 years
of 20 questions illustrates. Quantum theory has provided
a more sophisticated proof of this result using the Spectral
Decomposition Theorem (Isham, 1995).

(Nelson et al., 2004). In Figure 2 we see a set of association strengths for two words, “boxer” and “bat”.
Note the manner in which both words can be attributed
a meaning that belongs to one of two senses; an animal sense and a sporting sense. Thus, we claim that the
concepts BOXER and BAT are both ambiguous. Despite this ambiguity, humans are adept at recognizing
the sense that is intended for an ambiguous word. They
do this through reference to the context in which the
word is being used, and this context might depend upon
a wide range of factors (e.g. the co-occurrence of other
words spoken before and after, the history of a conversation, the social context of the speaker). We note at this
point that even our simple scenario has far more ambiguity than has appeared in the USF data (e.g. some
people would interpret boxer as a pair of shorts, and
someone could bat their eyes etc.), indeed, there are a
wide range of very fine gradations in meaning that might
be attributed to even these simple concepts. This added
complexity can be dealt with in our model through an
extension of the state space to higher dimensions, and
through the use of a more sophisticated set of data2 to
construct the vector space model that we shall present.
In the next section we shall show that it is possible
to construct a simple model of this ambiguity and its
contextual dependency through use of the quantum formalism.

A simple model of the manner in which context might
affect the interpretation that a subject ascribes to an
ambiguous word can be constructed through the use of
a superposition state, which is a novel concept of a state
arising in Quantum Theory (QT). In Figure 3(a), an ambiguous word w is represented in some context c, as a
superposition of recalled, |1i and not recalled |0i within
the mind of a subject. When presented with a cue (rep2

w, or not, with some probability. These probabilities can
be estimated through reference to the online USF data,3
which, in the context of a cue word “ball” suggests that
a subject will recall the concept BAT with a probability P r(BAT |ball) = .19, or they might recall something
else (P r(BAT |ball) = .81). We put this data into the
quantum superposition state of Fig. 3(a) and so represent the cognitive state of our subject in the context of
being presented the cue word “ball” as
√
√
|BAT iball = 0.81|0iball + 0.19|1iball .
(1)
Figure 3(a) represents these probabilites geometrically
using the measurement postulate of QT (Laloë, 2001;
Isham, 1995), but this same state can be easily obtained
through use of the Pythagorean theorem.
This simple model is made more interesting in Figure 3(b), where we have represented the fact that a different context (in this case a cue, but context could be
a more complex semantic component) might result in
a different set of recall probabilities. Thus, we could
represent BAT as the superposition in the cognitive
state
of a subject
when presented with the cue “cave”:
√
√
0.94|0i + 0.06|1i so giving a 6% probability that the
word “bat” will be recalled by a subject who is presented
with this different cue (or context). We see that the word
“bat” is more likely to be retrieved from memory when
a subject is presented with the cue “ball” than the cue
word “cave”, and this change in probability can be obtained from the same initial cognitive state through a
shift (i.e. a rotation) in the basis vectors representing
the context in figure 3(b).
How should we consider the combination of two words
in this model? While it is possible that a simple tensor multiplication of the two superposition vectors might
suffice, this is not necessarily the correct mechanism
(Bruza et al., 2009). Indeed, it seems possible that not
all senses of a word remain accessible during conceptual
combination. Thus, it might prove to be the case that a
BOXER BAT is only ever interpreted by human subjects
as “a small furry mammal with boxing gloves on”, or “a
toy bat that a boxer dog chews on”, which would imply
a case of perfect anti-correlation in the senses attributed
by a subject to the combination. That is, considering
the interpretation of the novel (i.e. non-lexicalized) conceptual combination BOXER BAT in the context of two
priming conditions, one applied to each of the concepts
in the combination (e.g. BOXER primed by “dog” and
BAT by “ball”) we denote a concept which is recalled
with the same sense as that for which it was primed as
1 and a failure to return in this sense by 0. For this scenario we might find that not all possible combinations of

http://web.usf.edu/FreeAssociation/AppendixC/ .

the two senses in the combination can be realized. For
example, we might find that a subject’s cognitive representation of BOXER BAT should be represented as
|BOXERi⊕|BAT i = a|01i+b|10i, where |a|2 +|b|2 = 1.
(2)
denoting a scenario where either BOXER has a sporting
sense and BAT an animal sense (|01i with probability
|a|2 ), or BOXER an animal sense and BAT a sporting
sense (|10i with probability |b|2 ).
Such a cognitive state has profound consequences for
the notion of compositionality. Indeed, QT has consistently shown that similar states cannot be interpreted
compositionally (Isham, 1995; Laloë, 2001). Thus, if a
similar set of experiments can be found that apply to
human language processing, then this would give strong
support for the claim that language cannot always be
considered compositionally. The remainder of this paper will briefly sketch out recent work which attempts
to test for such non-compositional conceptual behavior
(Kitto et al., 2010, 2011; Bruza et al., 2012).

Tests of (Non-)Compositionality
QT has a well developed suite of tests that can be applied
to systems of the form shown in Figure 1, and these can
be quickly adapted towards the the analysis of compositionality in language. For example, it is possible to construct a variation of the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt
(CHSH) inequality (Isham, 1995; Laloë, 2001), using an
analysis derived from Cereceda (2000), which tells us
that a system of this form can only be described as a
combination of it’s subcomponents if:
2 ≥ ∆ = |2(Pr(A1 = +1, B1 = +1)
+ Pr(A1 = −1, B1 = −1) + Pr(A1 = +1, B2 = +1)
+ Pr(A1 = −1, B2 = −1) + Pr(A2 = +1, B1 = +1)
+ Pr(A2 = −1, B1 = −1) + Pr(A2 = +1, B2 = −1)
+ Pr(A2 = −1, B2 = +1) − 2)| (3)
This formula (and a number of variations of it) has a substantial history in the physics and philosophy literature
(Laloë, 2001; Shimony, 1984), and lack of space prevents
a detailed explanation, however, we can briefly motivate
its usage through a discussion of figure 1 and of the potentially compositional nature of the system it describes.
Each subsystem A and B is represented by random variables: {A1, A2} and {B1, B2}, denoting whether a particular sense was observed (+1), or not (−1) under a
given experimental arrangement. For this system, compositionality is expressed in terms of a factorizable probability distribution: Pr(A, B) = Pr(A) Pr(B). The syntax
of this equation clearly shows how the model of the combined system is assumed to be expressed a product of the
distributions corresponding to the individual subsystems
A and B. When the inequality in (3) is violated, such a

1794

compositionality assumption does not hold. Thus, the ∆
value in (3) gives us a clear criterion for deciding whether
a given concept combination should be considered compositional or not. In a set of recent work (Kitto et al.,
2010, 2011; Bruza et al., 2012), we have performed a
number of experiments aimed at testing our formulation
of the compositional hypothesis, and we shall now briefly
discuss these results.

Empirical Evaluation
We utilized four different priming regimes in order to
generate the four different experimental scenarios required by Fig. 1. These experiments start by biasing
subjects towards a particular interpretation of a nonlexicalized conceptual combination through exposure to
words that have a particular sense representing the underlying concept. They then ask subjects to interpret
the conceptual combination, and to designate the senses
that they used in that interpretation. If conceptual combinations such as BOXER BAT are genuinely compositional, then it seems reasonable to assume that “vampire” primes BAT but has no priming effect on BOXER.
A probabilistic analysis using (3) was performed upon
the data obtained to test this assumption.
Table 1 lists the set of ambiguous conceptual combinations chosen, as well as the primes used to bias subjects
towards each of two senses for the respective concepts.
Primes were selected from the USF norms (Nelson et al.,
2004) and the trials were composed of six phases.
Phases 1-2: Two consecutive double lexical decision
tasks were carried out, where participants were asked to
decide as quickly as possible whether two strings, a prime
and the concept to be presented as a part of the compound given in Phase 3, were legitimate words, or if one
of the strings was a non-word. Participants responded
by pushing a button on the keyboard, labeled ‘word’
or a button labeled ‘non-word’ (left arrow and right arrow keys respectively). For instance, if given the strings
“coil” and “spring”, then participants were expected to
decide that both strings are words and so push the ‘word’
key, whereas if given “grod” and “church” then participants were expected to decide that they had been
shown a non-word combination and to push the ‘nonword’ key. Each lexical decision consisted of the the two
letter strings presented in the center of screen, one below
the other. They were presented in this arrangement to
discourage participants from interpreting the two words
as a phrase. As soon as the participant responded, the
screen was replaced by a blank screen for 800 ms, which
was then immediately followed by the second lexical decision phase. The participant’s second lexical decision was
followed by a 800 ms blank screen, and then immediately
followed by phase 3. For example, one lexical decision
task exhibited “coil” and “spring”, and was designed to
prime the mechanical sense of the concept SPRING in

the conceptual combination SPRING PLANT. The order of the two double lexical decision tasks was counterbalanced, so that half were presented in the same order as the compound words (e.g., “coil” and “spring”
are first presented, then “factory” and “plant”) and half
were presented in the reverse order (e.g., first “factory”
and “plant” are presented for lexical decision, followed
by “coil” and “spring”. Phase 3: A bi-ambiguous conceptual combination was presented in the center of the
screen (e.g. “spring plant”). Participants were asked to
push the space bar as soon as they thought of an interpretation for the compound. Filler compounds were
included for the filler (i.e. non-word) trials so as not
to disrupt the participant’s rhythm in making two lexical decisions followed by an interpretation. Phase 4:
Participants were asked to type in a description of their
interpretation. Phases 5-6: Two disambiguation tasks
were carried out, where participants choose what sense
they gave to each word from a list (e.g., plant = A.
‘a living thing’; B. ‘a factory’; C. ‘other’). The order
of test and filler trials were randomized. Participants
completed 24 test trials and 24 filler trials, and the full
procedure took 20-30 minutes. Experimental subcomponents utilizing non-words were discarded during the
analysis presented here.

Results
Table 1 lists a number of ∆ values, some of which violate equation (3). Confidence intervals around the CHSH
value ∆ were computed using the boostrap method that
both removed and added data points that corresponded
to interpretations that were either not present or added,
and for each iteration, a pseudo ∆ was computed. Confidence intervals
were computed using: mean(pseudo) ±
p
t0.975,n−1 var(pseudo)/n.
These results imply that there is good reason to believe that some conceptual combinations must be analyzed in a non-compositional framework. However, it is
still possible to provide further details about how exactly
the joint probability behaves during such a violation. In
what follows, we shall analyze three specific examples
from the three different categories of result: BOXER
BAT (where ∆ < 2); APPLE CHIP (where ∆ = 2); and
BANK LOG (where ∆ > 2).

Further Analysis
It is possible to write the joint probability in a form
that starts to explain how violations of (3) occur. To
do this we represent the four different random variables
{A1, A2, B1, B2} in a matrix where each random variable contribution is split into a set of possible outcomes.
This allows us to break down the results from Table 1
into a form that allows for a consideration of the underlying structure required for violations (or not) of (3). In
this representation we can write the data gathered from
the above experiments out as a set of joint distributions,

interpreted as an electronic device. This complete correlation of the senses attributed to the bi-ambiguous words
leads to a value of ∆ = 2. This is still a compositional
concept combination.
Finally, if we consider conceptual combination BANK
LOG then we can see how a non-compositional value of
∆ > 2 is obtained:

In this case, we see a complete correlation between the

when APPLE is interpreted as a computer then CHIP is

Here, we see no particular ordering or patterns when we
compare equations (3) and (4). We can see that the data
gathered does not center the distribution in such a way
that it can violate the CHSH inequality.
In contrast, APPLE CHIP leads to a joint distribution
that has a far more interesting structure:

While this case is similar to the one illustrated in (5),
it exhibits a key difference; a non-zero value has been
returned by the ensemble of subjects for the off-diagonal
case where Pr(A2 = +1, B1 = −1) = 0.13, which corresponds to the case where the subjects interpret “bank
log” as e.g. a financial institution made of wood. The
off-diagonal term in (3) means that there is enough probability ‘mass’ for a violation. Comparing (4–6) with the
set of equations typified by (3) we can understand that
while it is necessary to for a system violating such inequalities to have some correlation in the random variables, it is just as important to have an anti-correlation.

Conclusions
There is nothing in equation (3) that restricts its domain of application to quantum theory. Indeed, there
are many systems that appear to be separated in a similar way, and so should adhere to the probabilistic behavior that it requires. Indeed, an early work by Aerts
et al. (2000) proposed that the formalism of quantum
theory could be widely applied to the description of a
broad class of nonseparable systems, and this paper further contributes to this stream of work. More recently
Busemeyer et al. (2011) have applied the formalism of
quantum theory to obtain a unified description of human decision making and the way in which it violates
many of the axioms of standard probability theory. Together with the work presented here, these and many
other results suggest that the formalism of QT is widely
applicable to the analysis of psychological problems. We
suggest that this is due to the ability of the formalism to
incorporate a complex notion of context into its models,
a significant advantage in cognitive modeling.
More specifically, the work presented here has considered only two possible senses for each word, and a
very simple priming procedure, but we claim that this is
not a limitation of the model per se. Firstly, the spectral decomposition theorem (Isham, 1995) implies that
any measurement can be decomposed into a sum of projection operators. Secondly, more complex primes and
cues can possibly be modeled through the use of a vector
space approach that extracts the meaning of proceeding
sentences, phrases and part word cues.
In summary, it seems likely that a broad class of
systems which exhibit strong contextual dependencies
among their subcomponents can be well modeled in this
approach, and future work will seek to further clarify
the conditions under which such systems become noncompositional.
