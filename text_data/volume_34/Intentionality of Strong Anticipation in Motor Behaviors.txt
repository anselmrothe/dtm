Abstract
Pezzulo (2008) and Grush (1997, 2004, 2007) highlight, even

anticipatory systems, in contrast to the role of adaptivity in

argues against their claim, by alternatively arguing that the
strong anticipation—anticipation without employing internal
models—is primordial in the making of the anticipatory
behavior, while internal models are supplementary in the light
of efficiency. A novel notion of intentionality is raised for
strong anticipatory behaviors, based on the history of on-line
adjustments. The supplement of internal models on the top of
a strong anticipatory system makes the resulting anticipatory
system a Popperian machine, and consequently more flexibile.
Keywords: Weak and strong anticipation; internal models;
intentionality; motor behaviors.

Introduction
The embodied and situated approach to cognition is a
general revolt against the representationism, the thesis that
cognition consists of representations.
This thesis is
challenged radically by the behavior-based robotics (e.g.
Brooksian robotics, Gibsonian theory of vision) and
dynamic systems approach to cognition. Wherein, the role
of agent-environment interaction is highlighted in the
making of cognition, and the notion of cognition without
representation is radically raised. Within this approach,
however, some contend that the role of representation
should be preserved (Clark 1997, 2003; Keijzer 2001; Grush
1997
)

representation. Later on, within the same approach does the
need of representation scale up in the study of anticipatory
systems. The role of representation (or, internal models) in
such systems is highlighted, or even insisted, in contrast to
the role of adaptivity in the so-c

h,1997, 2004, 2007). Modelbased anticipation, thus, is seen as contrasted with
adaptivity or reactivity, as is technically manifest in the
contrast between weak and strong anticipation (Dubois 2003;
Stepp and Turvey 2010).
According to Dubois (2003), anticipation is the
determination of current states by taking account of future
states. Weak anticipation predicts the future states with
models of agents and the environment; whereas, strong
anticipation predicts future states without such models. The
strong anticipation employs the system itself (i.e. the agent
and its immediate environment), 1 rather than an internal
model (of agents and the environment). The role of models

A slogan in favor of the strong anticipation is that the system
itself is the best model (Stepp and Turvey 2010).

in anticipatory behaviors is well noticed (Pezzulo 2008)2, as
anticipatory behaviors are maintained control with internal
representations. By contrast, the role of strong anticipation
seems to be underestimated. In fact, strong anticipation
needs more study (Steep and Turvey 2010). That is, the role
of adaptivity in the making of anticipation remains in need
of research.
In what way do motor activities bear an intentional
relation to the environment? This query is a bit hard to
answer. The motor activities, on the one hand, are clearly
not managed by thought. Nevertheless, such activities, on
the other hand, do not seem to be completely meaningless,

can make sense: can that motor power be understood with a
certain sense of intentionality? Those two questions have
been responded since the end of the last century.
Regarding the first question, the topic of motor control is
well noticed both in psychology (Kawato 1999; Jeannerod
2006; Desmurget and Grafton 2000, to cite only three) and
in philosophy (Christensen and Hooker 2002; Clark 2002;
Clark and Grush 1999; Dreyfus 2007; Grush 1999, 2004,
2007). Motor activities are well conceived of in terms of
anticipatory agents, emulators, feed forward models and
feedback loops, etc. Regarding the second question, it has

based on a standing-for relation that is typically adopted in
the orthodox AI. However, two recent accounts attempt to
re-affirm the importance of the standing-for-based
intentionality in explaining anticipatory behaviors. The first,
Grush (1999, 2004, 2007) maintains a difference between
representational anticipation systems and adaptive systems.
He highlights the role of internal representation in
emulators—standing in for the actual motor activities—
without discussing whether there is another sense of

that can explain motor behaviors. The other, Pezzulo (2008)
advocates the role of internal representation in explaining
the guidance of goal-directedness in the anticipatory
behaviors. Common in Grush and Pezzulo are two
proposals: firstly, the contrast between truly cognitive minds
and mere adaptive systems; and secondly, explaining
cognitive mind/systems in terms of internal representations
of the non-actual activities. A system with such internal
representations, which can vanish before they are actually
carried out, is called a Popperian machine, as Popper (1996)

The present paper argues for the three-fold primordial role
of strong anticipation in the making of the anticipatory
behavior. As we will see in the following sections, the

the weak anticipation by means of modeling. Firstly, the
strong anticipation is primordial in the making of the
anticipatory behavior, while internal models are
supplementary in the light of efficiency. It is strong
anticipation rather than the internal models of the system
that makes possible anticipation. Secondly, a novel notion
of intentionality, in contrast to that on the basis of the
standing-for relation, is raised for understanding strong
anticipatory behaviors: the relation in which the internal
states of a body brings about a pre-registered end-state in
the environment. On grounds of that novel sense of
intentionality, strong anticipatory systems are intentional,
apart from its being intelligent. Thirdly, the supplement of
internal models on the top of a strong anticipatory system
makes the resulting anticipatory system a Popperian
machine, which is qualified to be a full-blown cognitive
agent. The present paper puts discussions in the context of
motor activities.

3

A similar point is put in terms of a Popperian creature (Dennett,
1995, p. 375)—a creature capable of breaking their cycle of direct
interactions with the local environment (Clark and Grush, 1999).

Anticipatory Behaviors
Internal Models
Reaching movement is a simple but paradigmatic example
of the anticipatory behavior. The inverse internal models
provide the feed forward motor commands that are
necessary to bring about the desired trajectory in relation to
a goal (Kawato 1999). Thus, prior to the onset of the
reaching movement is a motor plan assembled. In the
course of reaching movement, the motor plan is updated
continuously by internal feedback loops. Internal feedback
loops are employed because the biological mechanism of
sensory feedback loops produces significant delays (Kawato
1999; Desmurget and Grafton, 2000). The internal feedback
loops rely on forward models that integrate the sensory
inflow and motor outflow to evaluate the consequence of the
motor commands sent to a limb. The forward internal
model predicts sensory consequences of issued motor
commands (the probable position and velocity of an effector)
with negligible delays, or even predicts them in advance.
Thus, the forward models make the strategy of feedback
loops efficient in the light of making a real time response
for the reaching movement (Desmurget and Grafton, 2000).
The representational status of anticipatory behavior is
considered based on the importance of internal models, that
make anticipatory behavior sufficiently efficient and
accordingly make it possible in the ecological niche (Grush,
1997, 2004, 2007; Pezzulo, 2008).

Strong Anticipation
An anticipatory system is a system that takes account of
future states. A strong anticipatory system is an anticipatory
system without employing an internal model; otherwise, it is
a weak anticipatory system (Dubois 2003; Steep and Turvey
2010).
Steep and Turvey (2008) understands the notion of

states only takes account of current or past states, without
considering future states. In this sense, homeostasis can be
seen as reactive, as it is seen as involving no explicit goals
at all. Examples of systems with no explicit goals are as
follows: the single-cell Euglena approaching to the sunlight
(Goodale and Milner2004: 40), a reflex, the Watt Governor
(WG, van Gelder 1997), and the wall-following machine
(Martaric 1990). The reflex as the resulting response is not
pre-specified in the reflex mechanism of the muscle system.
The WG is a device for the speed control. The state with a
constant speed is the end-state, without being explicitly
specified in the device. The end-state is an end-point of a
purely physical chain. This makes the WG to be merely
adaptive, although it is indeed an intelligent design.
By contrast, a thermostat, which is a goal-pursuing
machine, embraces an explicit goal that is regarded as a prefixed state. The explicit goal is to be compared with a
current state, and an error to be reduced is consequently
derived. In addition, the outfielder discussed in Steep and

1931

Turvey (2008) has an explicit end-state—catching the flying
ball.
The strong anticipation preserves a role contributing to
flexibility of motor behaviors. Such a role is two-fold. On
the one hand, a strong anticipatory system approaches to the
goal in the complex environment. For example, by lining
up with the flying ball that becomes a fixed point (Clark
2003), the outfielder is likely to catch the ball successfully.
On the other, the motor controlling system, as a strong
anticipatory system, can further connect to various inner
models and consequently makes the system at stake a weak
anticipatory system. The former one, that achieves the goal,
is the primary concern of an anticipatory system. Whereas,
the latter, that is supported with inner models, makes the
anticipatory system a Popperian machine and consequently
more effective and efficient. As to the effectiveness,
avoiding some likely impediment and thus making the way
to achieve the goal more likely to success.
As to the
efficiency, it makes the way of achieving the goal passing
various real-time constraints.

Adaptivity in Strong Anticipation
This section considers two remarkable ways of adaptivity
appearing in strong anticipatory systems: coupling and
sensory feedback loops.

Coupling Ensures Completing a Task
The agent-environment coupling, as considered previously
in the example of an outfielder, ensures the completion of a
task.
When such coupling arises, a task would be
accomplished effectively and efficiently. Consider the
aforementioned outfielder problem. When the outfielder
moves to a position where the trajectory of the ball is seen
to be a point heading toward him, the coupling arises, and
catching the ball is straightforwardly ensured.
The
accomplishment of the task is sometimes determined by that
coupling condition.
In addition, coupling is inherent in the Gibsonian theory
of vision and action. Visual affordances of an object, say, a
cup, provide opportunities of actions, for example, grasping
the cup. Consider the simple tasks consisting of single
actions, suc

aforementioned, and the task of grasping a cup. A coupling
relation arises between the affordances of an object and the
consequently provided action. As the visual affordances
provide opportunities of an action, the coupling relation
ensures the completion of a corresponding task.

The Sensory Feedback Control for the System’

Performance

into account. The former part, the role of the sensory
feedback control, is based on the dual model theory of
motor movements, according to which a motor movement
begins with a motor plan that rapidly transports the hand
near to the target, and then depends on sensory feedback
loops that slowly direct the hand to the target. The latter
part, the non-efficiency of the sensory feedback control, is
evident in the remarkable delay resulting from the sensory
feedback control (Desmurget and Grafton, 2000). By
contrast, a feed forward model, as manifest in emulators
(Grush 2004), is an internal model that provides a
simulation of motor actions. Based on a simulated motor
action, when compared with the target, an error is derived
internally.
To be noted, the derivation of an error and the following
behavior of getting closer to the target on the basis of the
sensory feedback control, is managed by the system without
recourse to internal models. By contrast, the internal
feedback loops (as opposed to the sensory feedback loops)
rely on a forward model that makes the feedback strategy
efficient enough for the real-time reaching movement. The
resulting efficiency can be understood as it is a Popperian
machine. However, as will be argued in next section, the
intentional relation of the reaching movement is basically
manifest in the system with sensory feedback loops, if we
can provisionally put the consideration of efficiency aside.
Such sensory feedback loops unfold on account of the

Intentionality of the Strong Anticipatory
System
Do strong anticipatory systems bear intentionality? If they
do, in what sense are they intentional? Let us put
discussions in the context of motor movement. Such
questions relate to two considerations. For the first
consideration, such a notion of intentionality, if there is,
seems to have something beyond the standing-for relation,
given that motor movements are not completely thought-like.
The goal-state is brought about as an end-state of a causal
chain.5 The question, more specifically, concerns the sense
of intentionality which is born by causal activities. Then,
the second consideration is that the motor movements, if
they indeed bear intentionality in any sense, should be
distinct from physical reactions. This section discusses the
above two questions, centered on the notion of the goal.

The sensory feedback control need not rely on an internal
model,4 if the efficiency of motor movement is not taken

An internal model is a model of the system, including the agent
and its immediate environment (Dubois 2003). A remarkable
example is emulators (Grush 2004). The t

An end-state of a motor system is a state specifying the way in
which the target relates to its environment and the body.

An Account of Pragmatic Intentionality
To respond to the first consideration, a novel notion of
intentionality—pragmatic intentionality—is raised: an

odybring about an end-state
explicitly pre-registered in her perception or perceptual
imagery. If we consider how it is possible that those
internal states could bring about a specific end-state of a
causal chain, then we need to understand the evaluative
nature of the goal. The end-state is taken as the goal on
grounds of evaluation. There should be discrepancies
marked as negative values against states away from it, and
there should be machinery of reducing such negative values.
Thus, pragmatic intentionality can be further characterized:
internal resources (such as sensory feedback loops, bones

evaluate the discrepancies between the current state and an
explicitly pre-registered end-state of the motor task, and
reduce those discrepancies with the result of bringing about
that end-state in the environment.
The involving motor activities are authentically

cashes out an explicitly pre-registered end-state in
perception or perceptual imagery by bringing it about in the
environment. Those bodily internal resources transform the
pre-registered end-state in perception or imagery into an
end-state in the environment, an end-state consisting of
inter-relations between the body, the target object and their
environment. This is a pragmatic sense of intentionality
because internal resources of the body are used for bringing
about a pre-registered end-state. As a note, the above
consideration has nothing to do with an internal model with
a standing-for relation. As an example, a thermostat has
pragmatic intentionality as it consists of a feedback model
in relation to a pre-registered end-state.
To respond to the second consideration, the present paper
highlights the role of the aforementioned pre-registered
goal-state in the motor system. The end-state of the motor
processing initially turns up in perception or perceptual
imagery, and later is registered in the motor system before
the motor processing unfolds. This pre-registered status
makes the motor processing be neither physical nor reactive.
It promotes the processing of the motor system from the
physical level to an intentional level. To be noted, the goal
has a two-fold role in the motor system. Despite the
standing-for status of the goal, it does not stand on its own
as an internal model (such as an emulator) of the motor
system. The goal has a standing-for relation as it is initially
marked in the perception or perceptual imagery. Yet, once
it is pre-registered as the end-state of the motor processing,
it stands in the causal relation to states of the motor system.
A goal, hence, can be a part of a strong anticipatory system.
This two-fold role based on the pre-registered goal-state in
the motor system makes the motor system be neither purely
physical nor completely reactive to environmental
circumstances.

A Primitive Shooting System and a Coaching
System
A weak anticipatory behavior involves three elements: the
system itself (or, agent), its environment, and internal
models, while a strong anticipatory behavior involves only
the former two elements. Consider the cognitive role of a
strong anticipatory system, which is an agent in its
environment. Let us discuss in the context of a premature
shooting system supervised by a coaching system. Suppose
that shooting system is capable of hitting the target with the
probability of 10 % per shooting, that is, in average, hitting
the target once in ten shoots. Let us further consider a
shooting system with a supporting condition: the coaching

shoots, selects the best one, and accordingly the model
draws the shooting system to the shooting conditions of that
selected (best) one. Thus, the shooting system can shoot
with 100 % accuracy in average. Such a shooting system is
an anticipatory system, as the model suggests the shooting
system on the basis of (simulated) future conditions.
Then, in theory, that shooting system would be capable of
hitting the target accurately more efficiently.
The
aforementioned shooting system provides an analogy of an
accurate motor system, in the sense that the internal model
stands as a coaching system of the motor system.
One may contend that a motor system without the internal
modeling is but a non-cognitive adaptive system like
homeostasis. The coaching system is definitely cognitive,
as it is a Popperian machine. Yet, a shooting system itself
cannot be cognitive without the support of a coaching
system. That the motor behavior is cognitive is because of
the representing role of the internal models. 6 Such a
representing role is that the internal models simulate and
accordingly stand for the motor system together with its
environment.

aboutness—the traditional sense of intentionality. Note that
intentionality is a relation between the internal states of a
system and the world. Consider the reaching behavior as an
example. The system directs the body of a robot or a
biological body, such as limbs, to the target in the
environment. The achievement of a goal, hence, cannot
appear internally. Rather, it should take place with the real
body of the anticipatory system in its immediate
environment. The achievement of a goal should be
controlled internally in the anticipatory system, with or
without the support of an internal model. The internal states

of that system are dynamic, which may optionally be
supported with internal models (as weak anticipatory
systems). Let us discuss in terms of the control theory. In a
strong anticipatory system, those internal states include the
making of a motor plan (as an inverse model of the goal),
sensory feedback loops (producing an error by comparing
the current position of the hand and the goal), and the hand
movement with a view to minimizing the errors. A weak
anticipatory system, by contrast, is further supported with
internal models.
Both in the strong and the weak
anticipatory systems, the internal states subserve the body in
the light of reaching the target.
As a reminder, we previously made a pragmatic definition
of intentionality for strong anticipatory systems. The goaldi

The goal-directed agent is qualified to be intentionalitybearing since the processing of internal states brings about
performance in the environment. Note that the goal-directed
action is made by the anticipatory system’

(not by internal models). The internal control is manifest in
the agent(hand)-environment coupling when the feedback
loops are running. The internal control shows a tendency to
reach the goal state.
How do the internal states of an anticipatory system work
apart from the functionality of its internal models? In weak
anticipatory system, internal models (e.g. emulators)
represent the way in which the system will unfold in the
environment. They represent on grounds of the aboutness
relation, that the internal states of the system stand for the

contrast, apart from the internal models, the internal states
of the anticipatory system encode the way in which the
system manages to bring about the bodily reaching. How
could the strong anticipatory system bear intentionality?

Rowlands’Account of Representation in Deeds
The notion of strong anticipatory behaviors is closely
addressed by Rowlands (2006) in terms of deeds: deeds
consist of “
an array of on-line, feedback-modulated
adjustments that take place below the level of intention, but,
collectively, promote the satisfaction of the antecedent
intention (p. 103).” Rowlands claims that deeds are truly
representational, where representation is characterized with
the five conditions: (i) informational condition, (ii)
teleological condition, (iii) decouplability condition, (iv)
misrepresentation condition, and (v) combinatorial
condition. Among them, what seems hardest to justify is the
decouplability condition: “
[i]tem r qualifies as representing
states of affairs s only if r is, in an appropriate sense,
decouple from s. The problem is that it seems to conflict
with their on-line nature of feedback-modulated adjustments.
Even if this problem is solved, a further problem is that
simple adaptive devices, such as the WG, the thermostat,
and homeostasis, would consequently appear to be qualified
as representing.

Those two problems seem likely to be solved in
Ro
wl
a
nd
s
’ justification of decouplability: the learning
history of a motor system provides it with a proper function,
which can run “
off-drive”in the absence of environmental
stimuli (p. 166). Repetitive practice of a motor action, say,
catching a flying ball, results in a proper function of ballcatching.
The inner states of the motor action are
decouplable from the real stimuli of a flying ball, as such
states can run in absence of those stimuli. The activating
instances of a catching-ball device may differ while some of
them might fail in a catching action. Yet, the learnt motor
system has obtained the proper function of ball-catching.7
In addition, animals can learn, whereas the WG, the
thermostat, and a homeostatic system cannot. As a
consequence, such adaptive devices cannot have a bearing
of representing.
Rowlands justification of decouplability, however,
assumes intentionality instead of explaining it, as it resorts
to the history of learning (in his term, practice). The present
paper would justify the aforementioned decouplability
without recourse to either practice or learning, but, instead,
relies on the history of the s
y
s
t
e
m’
s on-line adjustments. A
successful catching system may operate on different objects,
and may even fail in some instances; yet, it is truly a system
that represents the states of affairs of catching-a-flying-ball.
Such a behavior does not causally dependent on a specific
kind of objects or events in the environment; hence, that
motor system represents the capability of catching-a-flyingball.
By contrast, the WG, the thermostat, and a homeostatic
system, are not representing in the previous sense. The
WG and the thermostat are (artificial) devices that do not
retain a history of adjustments. In addition, a homeostatic
system does not respond to the common living world, world
in the literal sense. Here we preserve the term of
representation to systems that are capable of responding to
the common living environment. homeostatic systems may
be perfectly anticipatory system; yet, it seems to stand at the
nebulous boundary of representation that anticipatory
systems have.

Conclusions
The present paper explains motor intentionality, by arguing
that strong anticipation is primordial in the making of the
anticipatory behavior, while internal models are
supplementary in the light of efficiency, like a coach
supporting a baseball team. A baseball team can perform
without a coach despite its lacking good strategies for
winning.
The strong anticipatory system bears intentionality
because it transforms itself from a body registering a
perceptual or imaginary end-state into a body which realizes
that end-state in the environment. Such an intentionality is
pragmatic because internal resources of the body are used

Rowlands deems that this way of justification is “
all the
decouplability we can reasonably require for the deed (167).”

for bringing about an end-state in the environment. The
pragmatic nature of such an intentionality makes clear two
components of the goal-directedness: an explicit end-state
pre-registered in perception or imagery, on the one hand,
and an evaluative sub-system and a machinery that reduces
the negative values, on the other. The former component is
put intuitively as a goal and the latter is machinery that
brings about the goal in the environment. Thus, we can
succinctly put the pragmatic intentionality of strong
anticipation in terms of the relation of bringing-about, that
is, internal states of the body bringing about the end-state in
the environment. A novel sense of intentionality, in contrast

characterized in terms of a s

A notable difficulty in considering a novel sense of
intentionality for motor activities is the question of how to
distinguish between motor intentionality and mere
adaptivity. Both of them are put in causal chains; yet, the
former is intentional, while the latter remains purely
physical (or biological). To resolve this difficulty, the
present paper resorts to the history of (on-line) adjustments
in the s

’response to the real environment. This is a
feature unseen in merely adaptive systems such as
homeostasis, the Watt Governor, and single-cell Euglena
approaching to the sunlight. They do not register their
history of (on-line) adjustments, and accordingly are not
anticipatory systems.
Motor behaviors are anticipatory. The present paper
explains why and how they are representing, in response to
the questions addressed by Wittgenstein and Merleau-Ponty,
as mentioned in the introduction. The supplement of
internal models on the top of a strong anticipatory system
makes the resulting anticipatory system a Popperian
machine, which makes the anticipatory systems more
flexible.
Because they are representing, the strong
anticipatory systems discussed in the present paper are not

anticipatory systems are supplementary, although they are
necessary in the light of efficiency that is manifest in
efficient motor behaviors.
