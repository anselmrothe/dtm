averages of ratings for each tactile material (120 materials)
in the SSW+SD (using 1569 cases) and SD-only (using
1800 cases) conditions. The analyses using 240 averaged
values (120 materials x 2 conditions) were performed in two
domains, in which the averaged values in the SD-only
condition were positive (comfort materials) or negative
(discomfort materials). For comfort materials (62 materials),
the means of ratings across 62 materials were 0.70 in
SSW+SD and 0.73 in SD-only. They were not significantly
different (paired t-test, t(61) = 0.39, p = 0.70). On the other
hand, for discomfort materials (58 materials), the means
across 58 materials were -0.48 in SSW+SD and -0.73 in the
SD-only. There were significant differences between the
values (t(57) = 3.41, p < .001). These statistical analyses       Figure 2: Distributions of vowels according to the values in

comfortable. However, when a touched material elicits
discomfort, the emotional evaluation can be attenuated by
expressing the sensation with sound symbolic words.
 To clarify the systematic association between phonemes of
onomatopoeic words and their influence on the evaluation,
we made distribution maps of 120 materials as shown in
Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The phonemes represent each
material in the maps. The representing phonemes were
determined from the first syllables used for expressing the
sensations most in the trials in the SSW+SD condition. Ones
in the right-side area in the maps are comfortable materials
and vice versa. In addition, ones in the upper side in the
maps indicate materials whose comfort levels are improved

comfort) and vice versa. Numbers of phonemes in the upper         Figure 3: Distributions of consonants according to values in

were systematically biased toward comfort for the
discomfort materials, which agrees with the previous
statistical analyses.
  The differences in the effect of attenuation or enhancement
according to the phonemes were statistically examined. We
collected phonemes whose numbers in the comfort or
discomfort area were more than six (5% of 120 materials)
and calculated the means of differences of rating values in
