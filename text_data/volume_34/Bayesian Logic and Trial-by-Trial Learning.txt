investigate trial-by-trial assessment of the
dependent variable: the selection of the
most probable hypotheses after each new
observation. To the best knowledge of the
authors, this has never been investigated
before in the CF debate.
   A supplementary goal is to assess whe-
ther putting evidence into language in the
course of trials may have an additional top-
down effect on the successive evaluation of
evidence. Here the ways how one obtains a
final (fixed) pattern of evidence are varied,
so that this may affect the predicted propo-
sitional representations. In one condition
the finally predicted hypothesis is expected
to appear most probable all along (homoge-
neous condition) and in another condition
different hypotheses are predicted to appear
more probable throughout the first learning
trials (heterogeneous condition). In its
current formulation BL, as a model of data-
based induction, would not be able to
account for such top-down effects. This is
the case although BL goes beyond naïve
probability, and leaves room also for
subjective priors. As we think there are top-
down effects for instance of categorization
(Hagmayer, Meder, von Sydow, & Wald-
mann, 2011) or causal coherence (von
Sydow, Hagmayer, Meder, & Waldmann,
2010), we think there may well be top-                    Figure 3: Format of the frequency presentation in Phase 1 (patterns)
