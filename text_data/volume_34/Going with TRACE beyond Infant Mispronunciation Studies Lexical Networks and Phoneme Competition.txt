                         Introduction
Research on infant spoken word recognition has made dra-
matic advances over the past two decades. Spurred on by
the refinement of experimental techniques such as the famil-
iarisation head turn preference procedure (Jusczyk & Aslin,
1995), the switch task (Stager & Werker, 1997) and the
mispronunciation task (Swingley & Aslin, 2000), our un-
derstanding of what infants and young children know about
the sounds of words, both familiar and newly learnt, has             Figure 1: Schematic diagram of TRACE architecture. Draw-
