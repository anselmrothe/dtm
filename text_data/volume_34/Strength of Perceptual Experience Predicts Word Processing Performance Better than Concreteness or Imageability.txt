Results & Discussion
Concreteness Analysis showed clear dissociations between
concreteness and modality-specific perceptual experience.,
with little consistency across abstract and concrete groups
(see Figure 1). Abstract words' ratings were predicted by
three of the five modalities, F(3, 290) = 8.64, p < .0001, R2
= .082, but with a low degree of fit and inconsistency in the
direction of the relationship: positively related to vision, and
negatively to auditory and olfactory strength. In contrast,            Figure 1: Modality predictors of concreteness ratings in
concrete words' ratings were predicted positively by                             Experiment 1 (* p < .05, ** p < .01).
olfactory and visual strength, F(2, 295) = 33.52, p < .0001,
R2 = .185, but these two perceptual modalities offered a
higher degree of fit than the model for abstract words.
  Most perceptual modalities therefore failed to retain a
consistent relationship with concreteness across the scale
(auditory, olfactory) or had no predictive value at all
(gustatory, haptic). However, the most serious conflict
concerned the inversion of the olfactory effect: more
olfactory meant more abstract, but more olfactory also
meant more concrete. Such inconsistency in behavior poses
serious problems for the assumption that abstractness and
concreteness represent two ends of the same continuum, and
rather indicates that participants applied different decision
criteria at the concrete and abstract ends of the norming
scale. While perceptual strength can explain more than
twice the concreteness variance in concrete words (19%)
than it did in abstract words (8%), participants are clearly
basing their concreteness rating on non-perceptual
information. It therefore appears that participants in
concreteness norming studies treated the scale as two                  Figure 2: Modality predictors of imageability ratings in
