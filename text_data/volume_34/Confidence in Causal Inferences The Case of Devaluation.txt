goes together with the occurrence or absence of another
event (i.e. event E). Based on this information people can
determine how likely an effect of interest will occur, given
the presence or absence of a putative cause. According to
standard psychological theories (e.g. Waldmann & Holyoak,
1992; Waldmann & Hagmayer, 2001; Griffith &
Tenenbaum, 2005) people integrate the information about
the (co-)occurrence and (co-)absence to either infer a causal
relation or estimate it' s strength, respectively. Therefore
standard psychological theories claim that people base their
judgments on all available data for contingency information.
