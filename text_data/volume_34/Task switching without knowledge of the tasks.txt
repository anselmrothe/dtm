   Task-cuing paradigms are typically taken to explore control of
task-set. However, they can be construed as requiring not selection
of a task-set, just retrieval of a cue+stimulus-->response (CSR)
mapping. In this paper we considered performance in a task-cuing
paradigm in which participants saw a color cue that indicated
whether they should classify a digit as odd/even or high/low using
one of two responses. Half the participants were instructed in
terms of tasks (Task group) whilst the others were required to learn
the CSR mappings without mention of tasks (CSR group).
Predicted performance under CSR conditions was modeled using
an APECS connectionist network. Both the model and CSR group
produced small switch costs, mostly due to incongruent stimuli,
and large congruency effects that reduced with practice. In
contrast, the Task group produced a larger switch-cost and a
smaller, stable congruency effect.                                          Figure 1 on the left shows the way in which the

cues that indicated the same outcome from stimuli became
equivalent e.g. here W and X would become equivalent as
would Y and Z, in that there would be a greater degree of
generalization between W and X than W and Y. Honey and
Ward-Robinson (2002) found that a modified connectionist
model was able to account for their data by allowing the
same hidden unit to carry the mappings for equivalent cues.
We used a model from the same class as their chosen model.
The model is known as APECS (McLaren, 1994, 2011;
LePelley & McLaren, 2001) and has a good record in
modeling human learning and memory. APECS has the
basic characteristics of a back-propagation network
(Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams, 1986), i.e. it is a standard
feedforward error correcting system with input, hidden and
output layers that has been modified in two key ways:
