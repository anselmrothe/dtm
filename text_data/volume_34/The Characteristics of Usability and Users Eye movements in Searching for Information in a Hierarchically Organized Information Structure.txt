Abstract
Finding information by successively following hyperlinks on
web pages is a typical task performed on the web. A number
of web users search for specific information and several
studies have concluded that following the “information scent”
is the fundamental process involved in the behavior. The aim
of this study was to investigate the relationship between the
strength of the “information scent” and user behavior by
applying a usability inspection method developed for web
usability studies. Three typical usability problems of
navigation, (a) a page with a weak scent correct link problem,
(b) a page with an unfamiliar correct link problem, and (c) a
page with a competing links nested under competing headings
problem, were compared with a problem-free page. In this
study, we applied the Cognitive Walkthrough for the Web
method to simulate a website, and analyze user behavior
along with usability problems. Participants were asked to find
an article on a simulated encyclopedia website. The success
rate, total clicks, total time, fixation count and gaze time were
analyzed. The results showed that the critical issues caused by
usability problems appear on the target-link page. The results
of this study confirm the effect of “information scent” and
provide a scientific insight into web navigation.

Introduction
Over the last decade, eye-tracking studies have provided
detailed insights into the way users interact with websites.
In earlier usability studies in web navigation, the level of
difficulty of a task for a user was measured by finding the
number of clicks required or the time taken to complete the
task, where a high difficulty level pointed to usability
problems in the web page. Eye-tracking methods have made
it possible to analyze user behavior in detail.
Several eye-tracking studies have provided an overall
understanding of the behavior of website users based on
their eye movements. Nielsen (2006) demonstrated that the
eye-movement patterns of website visitors are F-shaped by
aggregating a large amount of eye-movement data from web
pages. Cutrell & Guan (2007) and Guan & Cutrell (2007)
presented a series of detailed studies examining the
relationship between the fixation duration, and the ranking
and presentation of search results i.e. whether the search
results were accompanied by short, medium, or long
descriptions. They discovered that providing more

information next to the search results significantly improved
performance in information tasks, but degraded performance
in navigation tasks, where the performance was assessed in
terms of selecting the correct search result and the time
taken to complete the task. They argued that the difference
in performance was because when users were given longer
descriptions, they paid more attention to the description and
less to the URL of the search result, which would be of help
in assessing the usefulness of the search result. These eyetracking studies have provided a broad understanding of the
behavior of web users.
Habuchi, Kitajima, & Takeuchi (2008) focused on users’
cognitive activities, especially their goals and knowledge
when searching for information on the web. They explored
the relationship between usability problems and web users’
eye-movements by independently assessing usability
problems using Cognitive Walkthrough for the Web
(CWW) 1 (Blackmon, Polson, Kitajima, & Lewis, 2002;
Blackmon, Kitajima, & Polson, 2003, 2005; Blackmon,
Mandalia, Polson, & Kitajima, 2007). They considered three
typical usability problems: the weak scent correct links
nested under competing headings problem, the unfamiliar
correct link problem, and the competing links nested under
competing headings problem. They found that if a webpage
had any usability problems, user performance deteriorated
noticeably in terms of the total number of fixations in the
subsequent link selection stage. The performance was worst
on pages with a weak scent problem or an unfamiliarity
problem, which resulted in longer fixation durations because
users examined the link carefully before selecting it.
However, no difference in performance was observed in the
initial heading selection stage between pages with usability
problems and those without. The study showed that it is

Cognitive Walkthrough for the Web (CWW) is a web usability
inspection method that can detect several usability problems that a
website visitor may encounter while navigating through the
website in search of specific information by successively selecting
hyperlinks on intermediate navigation pages. It uses a Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) semantic space (Landauer & Dumais,
1997) to measure the “information scent” i.e. local proximal cues.
Web users use the “information scent” to make navigation choices
while navigating the web by following hyperlinks (Pirolli & Card,
1999; Blackmon et al., 2002, 2003, 2005; Chi & Suppattanasiri,
2003; Pirolli, 2005).

possible to distinguish between such pages based on the task
completion time and total number of fixations. Furthermore,
it showed that users’ gaze patterns varied depending on the
whether the problem was in the link itself, or elsewhere.
However, the test material they used consisted of just two
samples for each usability problem. To verify their results
and draw a general conclusion, results obtained using a
larger number of samples must be examined.
The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship
between usability problems and information search behavior
by applying the CWW method to handle various types of
usability problems. In this study, we conducted more
experiments and controlled other factors such as familiarity
of the desired information. We built a controlled website to
study the relationship between usability problems and user
behavior.

Experiment
The task used in this study is an information search task
performed within a hierarchically organized information
structure. The task difficulty depends primarily on the
strength of information scent on each navigation page for a
given search target. The three types of usability problems
compared are, (1) weak scent correct link problem, (2)
unfamiliar correct link problem, and (3) competing links
nested under competing headings problem; where problemfree items existed. These usability problems can be detected
through CWW.

Method
Materials The Japanese LSA semantic space is necessary
for finding usability problems in CWW. It was constructed
using corpora from the Japanese language Wikipedia
abstract containing 116,038 words and 129,937 contexts.
The semantic space of the Japanese LSA consists of
116,038 words and 300 dimensions. Please refer to
Takeuchi, & Habuchi (2008) for details.
A simulated encyclopedia website was constructed for
this study. It has the same link structure as the Microsoft
Encarta website. The menu was two levels deep, with 9 toplevel links (called headings) and 93 second level links
(called links). Each entry word and its description from the
Wikipedia abstract were categorized into one of the 93 links.
Usability problems were identified by applying CWW on
these articles (Takeuchi, & Habuchi, 2008).
We selected 97 candidate articles, such that each article
either had no usability problems, or had one of the
following problems: weak scent correct link problem;
unfamiliar correct link problem; and competing links nested
under competing headings problem (three competing links).
The predicted link-click count in this experiment was 2.29
for no usability problems, 3.81 for weak scent, 4.05 for
unfamiliar links, and 4.26 for competing links nested under
competing headings, according to the CWW model
(Blackmon et al. 2007).
The entry words from the selected articles varied in their
degree of familiarity for users. As it is desirable for each

entry word from the candidate material to have the same
level of familiarity, we conducted the word concept
familiarity rating task for the 97 entry words with 48
additional subjects (aged between 20 and 33 years with a
mean age of 24.3 years). The familiarity rating scale was
from 1 (least familiar) to 5 (most familiar). Finally, we
selected 20 articles such that each problem type had 5
articles from which unfamiliar entry words would be chosen
(see Table 1). These articles were used as the search targets
in the experiment.
Participants Thirty-five university students participated in
this study. Nine of the participants were excluded: six due to
not having sufficient eye-tracking data and three others who
reported after the experiment that they misunderstood the
task. Twenty-six university students (11 males and 15
females; aged between 18 and 24 years with a mean age of
20.6 years) participated in the experiment. All participants
were native Japanese speakers and received compensation
for their participation. They had normal or corrected to
normal vision. They were all regular users of the internet
and were used to browsing with Internet Explorer. They
were ignorant of the hypothesis being investigated in the
study.
Apparatus and Procedure The eye-tracking equipment
used was a Tobii X60 eye-tracker with Tobii studio 1.24
software. The minimum fixation duration was set to 40 ms
and the fixation radius to 20 pixels. Eye movements were
recorded at a sampling rate of 60Hz. The experimental
website was opened in Internet Explorer 6 under Windows
XP. URL visibility events, mouse movement, and click
events were recorded.
The task was to find the relevant article within 130
seconds. The search topic, along with a short description
was provided to the participants. The expectation was that
participants would build a mental representation of the item,
which they would use to evaluate the “information scent” of
the navigation pages in the website.
Participants were tested individually. They were first
seated in front of a screen-mounted eye-tracking system.
Next, they were required to search for the desired
information on the simulated encyclopedia website. In each
test, the participant was given a target word. On clicking,
the target word was replaced on the screen by the heading
page containing a description of the search target and 9
headings. Participants made their choice by clicking on one
of the sections. If a participant reached the target-link, the
target page was shown, and then the next trial began when
the participant clicked the “next” button (see Figures 1 and
2). To eliminate order effects, the 20 items were allocated
among four blocks and the order of the blocks was
counterbalanced. Each participant was given four blocks of
five trials each. There was a short break of a few minutes
between each block. Participants were tested each session
lasted approximately 25 minutes.
The dependent variables were the success rate, time taken
to complete the task, total number of clicks, total fixation
count and gaze time.

separately for the success rate, total clicks, and total time.
The significance level for ANOVA results was p<.05. A
summary of the success rate, total clicks, and total time
results for the experiment is presented in Table 2.
Success rate Before an angular transformation was
performed, the success rate data were skewed: Problem-free
= -2.56, Weak scent problem -1.19, Unfamiliarity problem .53, Competing links problem 1.36. Post-transformation, the
skewness was reduced to -2.56, -1.11, -.03, and 1.36,
respectively. An analysis of the variance indicated a
significant difference between the angular-transformed
success rates [F(3, 75)=30.20 p<.001]. Post hoc testing
indicated that the transformed success rate for the “problemfree” case were significantly higher than for cases with a
usability problem.
Click count Prior to the log transformation, the total clicks
data were skewed: Problem-free 1.03, Weak scent problem
0.97, Unfamiliarity problem 0.24, Competing links
problems 0.45. Post-transformation, the skewness was
reduced to 0.50, 0.36, -0.31, and -0.38, respectively. An
analysis of the variance indicated a significant difference
among the log-transformed total clicks for usability
problems [F(3, 75)=51.20, p<.001]. Post hoc testing
indicated that the transformed click count for the “problemfree” case were significantly less than for cases with a
usability problem.
Solution time Prior to the log transformation, the solution
time data were skewed: Problem-free 1.18, Weak scent
problem 0.25, Unfamiliarity problem 0.12, Competing links
problems 0.18. Post-transformation, the skewness was
reduced to 0.51, -0.07, -0.64, and -0.38, respectively. An
analysis of the variance indicated a significant difference in
the log-transformed success time for usability problems
[F(2.58, 64.38)=59.63, p<.001]. Post hoc testing indicated
that transformed solution times for the “problem-free” case
were significantly less than for cases with a usability
problem.

Results

Eye tracking analysis

We analyzed the data from when a heading page was
opened to when the target link was clicked. An analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and several comparisons were
performed separately for the success rate, total click count,
and the task completion time. These results are shown in
Tables 2 and 3, grouped by usability problem type. An
ANOVA and several comparisons were also performed

We conducted eye-tracking analysis for two regions of the
web page, the target description area, and the navigation
area during each target selection stage. Tables 4 and 5 show
the results of the eye tracking analysis.
Fixation counts Before analysis, all data were
logarithmically transformed.

Target-heading selection stage A two-way analysis of
variance was conducted for the fixation counts until the
initial heading was clicked. An information area main effect
was not obtained [F(1, 25)= 2.23, n.s.]. Also, the usability
problem main effect was significant [F(2.77, 69.34)=25.02,
p<.001], confirming that the Weak scent problem link pages
had significantly more fixations than other pages. Finally,
the information area and usability problems interaction was
significant [F(2.57, 64.35)= 20.19, p<.001]. A Bonferroni
post hoc analysis of this interaction revealed that the Weak
scent and Unfamiliar link pages had more fixations than that
the other two cases, regardless of page area. In addition,
although the Competing links problem pages had fewer
fixations in the goal description area, they had more
fixations in the navigation area.
Transit-link stage Not all participants saw the extra transitlink page; analysis reduced the participant number from 26
to 19. A two-way analysis of variance was conducted for the
total fixation count in the transit-link selection page. An
information area main effect [F(1, 18)= 111.64, p<.001] was
significant, confirming that the navigation area was
responsible for far more fixations than the target description
area. The usability problem main effect was significant
[F(2.48,44.63)=13.02, p<.001], which confirmed that the
Weak scent or Competing problem link pages had
significantly more fixations than the Problem-free pages.
The interaction of information area and usability problems
was significant [F(2.65,47.67)=4.81, p<.01]. A Bonferroni
post hoc analysis was performed and it showed that in total,
the Weak scent, and Competing links problem pages had
more fixations than the Problem-free pages.
Target-link selection stage A two-way analysis of variance
was conducted for the fixation counts in the target-link
selection page. An information area main effect [F(1, 25)=
156.28, p<.001] was significant, confirming that the
navigation area was subject to significantly more fixations
than the goal description area. The usability problem main
effect was significant [F(2.98,74.57)=15.87, p<.001],
confirming that the Weak scent and Unfamiliarity problem
link pages had significantly more fixations than the
Problem-free pages. However, Competing links problem
pages had fewer fixations than Problem-free pages. The
interaction of information area and usability problems was
also significant [F(3,75)=5.16, p<.01]. A Bonferroni post
hoc analysis confirmed the difference in fixation distribution.
Weak scent link problem pages in total had more fixations
than Problem-free pages. In the target-description area,

Unfamiliar link pages had more fixations than Problem-free
pages. However, Weak scent link pages gathered more
fixations in the navigation area.
Gaze time Before analysis, all data were logarithmically
transformed.
Target heading selection stage A two-way analysis of
variance was conducted for the gaze time until the targetlink was clicked. An information area main effect was
obtained [F(1, 25)=4.83, p<.05], confirming that the targetdescription area had significantly longer gaze time than the
navigation area. The usability problem main effect was
significant [F(2.94, 73.59)=24.18 p<.001], confirming that
the Weak scent problem link pages had significantly longer
gaze time than the other cases. The information area and
usability problems interaction was significant [F(2.55,
63.72)=18.05, p<.001]. A Bonferroni post hoc analysis of
this interaction revealed that the gaze time at the targetdescription area for Weak scent correct link problem items
was longer than that in other cases. However, in the
navigation area, Weak scent, and Unfamiliar link problem
pages had longer gaze time than the Problem-free pages.
Transit-link stage We summed up surveyed areas
individually and divided total gaze time by total pages
opened. As a result, the number of participants was reduced
from 26 to 19. A two-way analysis of variance was
conducted for the gaze time for transit-link pages. An
information area main effect was obtained [F(1, 18)=83.12,
p<.001]. The usability problem main effect was significant
[F(1.62,29.24)=10.96, p<.001], confirming that Weak scent
and Competing links problem pages had significantly longer
gaze time than the Problem-free pages. The information area
and usability problems interaction was obtained [F(1.44,
25.94)=7.86, p<.01]. A Bonferroni post hoc analysis of this
interaction revealed that in the target-description area, all
usability problem pages had a longer gaze time than
Problem-free pages. However, in the navigation area, Weak
scent, and Competing links problem pages had longer gaze
times than the Problem-free case.
Target-link selection stage A two-way analysis of variance
was conducted for the gaze time of the target-link selection
page. An information area main effect [F(1, 25)= 7.55,
p<.001] was significant, confirming that the navigation area
was subject to significantly longer gaze time than the target
description area. The usability problem main effect was
significant [F(2.1, 52.53)=7.55, p<.001], confirming that
Competing links problem pages had a lower gaze time than
other cases. Unfamiliar link problem pages had a longer

1635

gaze time than the Problem-free case. The interaction
between the information area and usability problems was
not significant [F(1.6, 39.88)=2.32, n.s.].

Discussion
The results indicated clear differences between problem-free
and usability problem pages, in the success rate, total clicks
and total time. The eye-tracking data showed that users’ eye
movements for selecting a target link varied depending on
the nature of the usability problem. Two main conclusions
can be drawn from this study. The first is that usability
problems occur from the first heading selection stage in the
navigation area. Pages with a weak scent problem had more
issues than other pages. Web pages with the latter problems
forced users to examine links and the target description
more times than for problem-free pages.

The other point was certain characteristics of usability
problems were clear at the target-link selection stage. In
pages with a weak scent problem or an unfamiliarity
problem, it took users longer to select a link. This is
presumably because participants had to discern the meaning
of the correct link by carefully reading the link label. A
possible explanation for this phenomenon is that for the
weak scent correct link problem, participants looked at the
navigation area several times. In contrast, for the unfamiliar
correct link problem, participants remained at one link page
for longer. These situations differed from cases of
competing links nested under competing headings, where
users could immediately select a link because it was a good
match for the target and less effort was needed to
understand the meaning of the link. We can also say users’
eye movement before clicking a link at the target-link
selection stage varied according to the usability problem of
the targeted link.

Conclusion
This study aimed to investigate how website visitors search
for desired information in web pages with usability
problems. Three types of usability problems, the weak scent
correct link problem, the unfamiliar correct link problem,
and the competing links nested under competing headings
problem, were compared against problem-free pages. The
results showed that participants’ behavior when faced with
usability problems was distinguishable from behavior on
problem-free pages in terms of the success rate, total
number of clicks and total time taken. In addition, it was
possible to distinguish the usability problem facing the user
from the fixation counts and gaze times at the target-link
selection stage.
The eye-tracking analysis expanded on the information
gained in previous studies. This study showed that users’
eye movement before clicking a link in the target heading
and target-link selection stages varies depending on the
usability problem. Pages with competing links nested under
competing headings have users spending less time before
selecting the correct link, but they involve more clicks due
to confusion from incorrect links. Pages with a weak scent
problem or an unfamiliarity problem have users taking more
time to select the correct link.
This study has attempted to explain the relationship
between “information scent” and user behavior. In future
work, we aim to extract the discriminative behavior when
two or more problems exist simultaneously.
