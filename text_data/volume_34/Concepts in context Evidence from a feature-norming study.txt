this case, the authors extended their analysis to the domain of
actions and events. They collected norms for 167 living and
non-living objects and for 287 events and actions.
   The pros of these collections are relatively straightforward;
however they exhibit also different limitations (McRae et al.,
2005). The process of collection, normalization and classi-
fication is extremely long and expensive. Moreover, the lin-
guistic nature of the task favours the information which is
easily verbalized, penalising spatial and temporal relations
between entities. During the classification phase, the annota-                (a) the APPLE is ripening on the            (b) A man is buying an APPLE
