suffix -tachi is never used with inanimate nouns (and is
optional with animate nouns). There are unique quantifiers
for animates, but those used for objects and substances form
an overlapping set. The Japanese language also have
separate ‘exists/is located’ verbs for animates and
inanimates (-iru and -aru respectively). Thus, the likelihood
of treating an object as an individual drops markedly

A basic demographic questionnaire on language exposure
and a parent checklist on productive vocabulary were used
to ensure and control for homogeneity among the
participants. To assess the children’s vocabulary, parents
were asked to complete an adapted Vietnamese version of
the MacArthur–Bates Communicative Development
Inventories (MCDI; Fenson, Dale, Reznick, Bates, Hartung,
Pethick, & Reilly, 1993). The Vietnamese version of the
MCDI was developed by translating the American English                  Figure 6: Substance. Testing choices matched on CO,

were given in a neutral manner to avoid biasing the child’s
response. For animates, testing choices were matched on
Shape-Texture (SH+TX), Shape-Color (SH+CO), and
Color-Texture (CO+TX). For inanimates and substances,
testing choices were matched on Shape (SH), Texture (TX),
and Color (CO). See Figure 4-6 for an example of the
testing choices. According to Jones & Smith (2002), adult
judgment indicates that the expected answer choice for
animates should be organized by similarities based on
SH+TX, SH for inanimates, and TX for substances.                     Figure 8: Proportion of expected choice for Inanimates
