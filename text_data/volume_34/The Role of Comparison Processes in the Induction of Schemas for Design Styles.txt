Method
Participants A total of 147 participants (49 in each of three
training conditions) were recruited online through Amazon
Mechanical Turk (http://www.mturk.com). This system has
been demonstrated to produce reliable data in many experi-
mental studies (e.g., Paolacci, Chandler, & Ipeirotis, 2010;
Mason, & Suri, 2011). Each participant was paid 60 cents
for completing the study, which took about 10 minutes. At
the conclusion of the study, information was collected about
participants’ age, nationality, and possible color blindness.
Participants (52 male, 95 female) were all residing in the
United States, and ranged in age from 18–61 years (M =
31.5). We tracked IP addresses to ensure that participants
were not repeatedly sampled. The participants described           Figure 1. (A). Four examples of each style presented in

five examples of each type of home décor item (e.g., stools
of each of the Styles X and A-D), and were asked to com-
pare them and describe the difference between Style X and
the other styles. This task was repeated for each of the three
types of training items. The presentation order of pictures in
Style X and the other styles was fully randomized.
    During the subsequent test phase (see Figure 4), pairs of
examples of four novel types of home décor items were pre-
sented (stools, wall lamps, duvet sets, and fabric). Each pair
included one example of Style X and one example of some
other style (Styles A-D). For each pair, participants rated
which example was more likely to be from Style X, using
the same 8-point scale as had been used in Study 1.
   Finally, in the evaluation phase, participants were pre-
sented with the 30 descriptors in random order. Participants
used a 4-point rating scale to evaluate how well word cap-
tured their impression of Style X (with a rating of 4 indicat-
ing that the descriptor “definitely” fit Style X).               Figure 4. Four pairs of new pictures presented to the par-
