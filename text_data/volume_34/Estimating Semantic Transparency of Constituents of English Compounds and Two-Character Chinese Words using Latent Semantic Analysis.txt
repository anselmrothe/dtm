   One possible solution is to access the primary meaning of
a constituent. The first step of our proposed idea is to find
words containing a constituent that a rater possibly
activates. Since a constituent may have several meanings,                                          (630)
the primary meaning of the constituent is computed by a
hierarchical clustering algorithm. Since LSA cosine values

rarely go below 0 in high-dimensional spaces, we use one
minus the absolute value of the LSA cosine as distance
function and a given threshold. The selection of this                                                  (24)
threshold is discussed below in the Reanalysis of Previous
Data and General Discussion sections. Since word                                                                 (3)
