from the total set of attributes and thus changes over time.
The conjunction of attributes is called an evaluation set or                                              REGAL Model

REGAL does not ignore aspects that are common to the

    Both EBA and REGAL prefer discrete features and thus
a special arrangement is needed to deal with continuous
dimensions (See, Gensch & Ghose, 1992 for another                                                            C2

  Interactions of Choice Set Effects Suppose that new
Option C is placed at C1. Attraction effect predicts P(A) will
be larger while Similarity effect predicts P(A) will be
smaller. If C is place at C2, Similarity effect predicts P(A)
smaller while Compromise effect predicts P(A) will be             Figure 4a: P(A) as a function of C location
larger. If C is placed at C3, P(A) may become larger because
C is dominated by both A and B but more strongly
dominated by A than B, and there may be a slight similarity
effect between C and B as well.
  Apparently, in these cases choice set effects compete or
collaborate and the choice probabilities should be
determined as a non-linear function of forces that try to push
up or down probabilities. In choice effect studies, pure
conditions in which the effect of a single force becomes                Attraction Effect
observable have been used. A next challenge should be to
clarify the joint effects of choice set effects and the present
study is the first such attempt.
RESULTS                                                                                                            Similarity Effect
   By moving Option C on the space (Figure 3), we can
observe how the probabilities for Options A, B, and C
change. REGAL can probe the joint effects by generating
probability topographies (Figures 4, 5, and 6) calculated            Figure 4b: P(A) as a function of C location
from Equation (A.3) in Appendix. Several detailed values
for parameters are also shown in Appendix.

                                                          same topographic probability information. The probabilities
                                                          are theoretical predictions in an ideal space
                                                            The reading of Figure 4a and 4b is a little confusing: they
                                                          are showing P(A), the probability that Option A will be
                                                          chosen, as a function of C location. Therefore, the right
                                                          lower high region, for example, should be read that “if you
                                                          place C around here, P(A) will be high.” Figures 5a and 5b

                                                          figures give a natural interpretation. The graph for P(B) is

                                                          attributes. Further, it can produce predictions for choice
