   The General Theory of Verbal Humor (GTVH: Attardo &
Raskin      1991),     is    an     extended,      second-stage
multidisciplinary theory of humor that is also built upon the
notion of script overlap and script oppositeness. The theory,
empirically verified in Ruch et al (1993), describes jokes in
terms of six knowledge resources: Script Opposition (SO),
informed largely by linguistics, deals with script overlap
and oppositeness presented in Script-based Semantic Theory
of Humor (SSTH); Logical Mechanism (LM), informed by
logic and cognitive psychology, accounts for the way in
which the two scripts in the joke are brought together in a
faulty, but locally valid way; Situation (SI), informed by

that, a control version based on the longer real variant of the

based on the fact that jokes are folkloristic creations
