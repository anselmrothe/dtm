Olseth (1995) found that learners were more likely to solve
correctly problems in which schematic and mathematical
roles were matched consistently with their default
expectations than problems in which such matches were
inconsistent. In light of the preceding discussion, learning
about a mathematical structure via several examples based
on the same schema might lead learners to induce concepts
tied to that particular schema, and thus to perform poorly on
problems involving other schemas. Conversely, systematic
