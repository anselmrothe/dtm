   This article presents the results of an online creativity experi-
   ment (N = 81) that examines the effect of example timing on
   creative output. In the between-subjects experiment, partici-
   pants drew animals to inhabit an alien Earth-like planet while
   being exposed to examples early, late, or repeatedly during the
   experiment. We find that exposure to examples increases con-
   formity. Early exposure to examples improves creativity (mea-                                            (b) “balances on its circular

   exposure to examples interspersed with prototyping leads to
   even better results. However, late exposure to examples in-
   creases conformity, but does not improve creativity.

of Marsh et al. (1996) (and Smith et al., 1993), participants
were instructed that examples were only shown to help them
create their original creations, and that we did not want them
to copy the examples in any aspect. For the Think task, par-
ticipants were asked to “think about aliens” they planned to
draw in the next session for 90 seconds. In the Repeated Ex-
amples condition, participants saw the same three examples
before both drawing sessions.
   After the second drawing session, participants filled out a
survey that covered demographics, artistic interest and ability
and the thought-process they followed while drawing.
Labeling features in drawings
Participants generated a total of 543 drawings. Each drawing
was labelled with the features it incorporated from the fea-
ture set of Marsh et al. (1996) (Appendix). Drawings were
annotated on Mechanical Turk, since the features were well-
defined. All workers were US resident and at least 18 years
of age, and were compensated US$0.50 for the task. Workers
who participated in the experiment were disallowed from the
annotation task (and vice-versa). All annotators were blind to
experimental condition.
   Workers were trained using a drawing from a pilot partic-
ipant (Figure 3). Then, each worker annotated a set of seven
randomly assigned drawings. Workers also rated how cre-
ative they found the drawing on a 7-point Likert scale (each
annotator saw at least one drawing from each condition).
Lastly, annotators could flag offensive (or non-alien) draw-        Figure 4: Example drawings provided to participants. All

                             Results
We analyze data using a mixed-effects linear model. Since
participants drew multiple drawings per drawing session, un-
less noted, we consider the participant as a random effect
with a fixed intercept; and experimental condition, drawing
session (first or second), and an interaction term as fixed-
effects in all our analysis below. Reported p-values are from
a Monte-Carlo (MCMC) simulation (Baayen et al., 2008).
Examples increase conformity
Following Smith et al. (1993), conformity was measured
as the number of critical features incorporated per drawing.
Without controlling for the drawing session, examples shown
at the start of the experiment increased the number of critical
features that were incorporated into drawings (t(507) = 2.06,
p < 0.05), consistent with results from (Smith et al., 1993;
Marsh et al., 1996). Participants in the Late Examples con-
dition show higher conformity in the second drawing session
(i.e. post-exposure) [t(419) = 1.83, p = 0.07].
Early exposure increases uncommon features
                                                                        Figure 5: Participants in early and repeated exposure con-
