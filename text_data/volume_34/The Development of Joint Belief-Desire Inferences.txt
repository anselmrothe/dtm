Stimuli and Design
3D animated movies were created using Alice 2.2
programming software (http://www.alice.org). Stimuli are
available at: http://saxelab.mit.edu/bunny/. Each participant
watched one movie two times followed by a short ending.
Movie Introduction Each movie begins with a bunny
standing on a green platform. A brown wall divides the
platform—this wall reaches above the bunny’s eye level,
obstructing his view of the other side. There is a tree with
three different fruit on the bunny’s side of the wall. The fruit
varied in shape and color (yellow, red, and orange), and
position of the fruit was counterbalanced across children. At
the beginning of the movie, the bunny waves and says                     Figure 1: Final frame of Check Stay Condition (red arrow shows
“Hello!” He then turns to the tree, points at the three fruits           path).

these fruits stays on the other side of the wall (Fruit 2), and
the other (Fruit 1) falls off of the platform. In the movies
viewed by children, Fruit 1 rolled out of sight. The bunny
turns to get his fruit, sees Fruit 3, and takes one of three
paths: Check Stay (CS), No Check (NC), or Check Turn
(CT) (see below for detailed description).
