frequency, as shown in Figure 2. Hence, additivity (i.e.,
main effects of frequency and stimulus quality, but no
interaction) indicates that stimulus quality and frequency
have independent loci of influence, and this further implies
that frequency affects a later stage (one that occurs after
stimulus quality; as shown in the upper section of Figure 2).
An overadditive interaction where the frequency effect is
greater for words of low stimulus quality as compared to
high stimulus quality would indicate that these two
variables influence at least one stage in common, and it
follows that frequency has an early locus of influence (as
shown in the bottom of Figure 2).

                          Discussion
In the present study, the joint effects of stimulus quality and
word frequency are characterized by an underadditive
interaction, as the frequency effect for words of high
stimulus quality was reliable but not for words of low
stimulus quality. This finding may be considered
counterintuitive because additive factors logic does not a
