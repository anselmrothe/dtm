questioner does not know the actual location of the sticker,
then the repetition of the question provides little additional
evidence; however, a knowledgeable questioner might have a
good reason for giving the learner with a second chance at an-
swering the question. In these cases, this apparently neutral
query is not neutral at all; it is a strong cue to the learner that
they should change their answer.
   In what follows we will explore the idea that even a “neu-
tral” query carries information about the state of the world
when a questioner is knowledgeable. We present a proba-
bilistic model that demonstrates how an ideal learner might
evaluate such “neutral” queries in scenarios in which the
questioner is knowledgeable and scenarios in which she is
ignorant. With the model, we evaluate the conditions un-
der which switching guesses is the rational choice for the
learner. We then test the basic prediction with preschoolers in
an experiment in which the informant’s knowledge or igno-
rance is made explicit. We suggest that repeated questioning
does indeed lead a learner to switch responses and that even
preschoolers are sensitive to the knowledge state of others
when making such inferences.

Materials 5 pairs of colored cups (pink, blue, yellow,
green, orange) were used in the conditions. An animal sticker
was placed on the inside of one of the cups in each set.
Procedure The experimenter began by pulling aside a pair
of cups and showing the child that there was a sticker inside
one and no sticker inside the other. The experimenter then
said, “In this game, it is going to be your job to guess which
cup has the sticker inside. For each set of cups I’m going
to ask you twice which cup you think has the sticker inside.
After you make your first guess I will ask you once more and
you can either keep your guess the same or guess the another
cup. If your second guess is right then you get a point and
for every point you get we will play a game at the end. So
remember you want to try and get your second guess right
so you can get a point!” The experimenter then proceeded to
take a different pair of cups and said, “Let’s take a look at
