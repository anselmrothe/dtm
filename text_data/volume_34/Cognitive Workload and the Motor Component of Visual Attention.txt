    Fixation Locations. Analysis of the eye data was per-
formed using the areas of interest displayed in Figure 3. Only
data recorded while the arrow was within a city block is in-
cluded (e.g. not in an intersection). The data yielded several
differences in fixations between the high vs low memory con-
ditions. Figure 4 shows the proportion of time spent looking
at the arrow, direction box, and road areas. High memory
subjects spend less time fixated on the arrow and more time
looking at the direction box throughout the city block. This
difference is most pronounced before the instruction appears

appearance of the instruction), suggesting that low memory

and 5 demonstrate, compared to low memory subjects, high
memory ones devoted proportionately more time looking at
the direction box and less time looking at the arrow1 .
    The fixation pattern for low memory subjects likely re-
flects a proactive strategy designed to maximize time spent
fixating on the arrow while maintaining the ability to moni-
tor for instructions. It is a strategy that high memory subjects
were either unwilling or unable to pursue.
