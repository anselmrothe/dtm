specific facial representations of the items to the camera.
For example, a very unhappy face (corners of the mouth

the correctness), and a very happy face (corners of the
mouth pulled up) represented a score of 5 (very certain
about the correctness). These facial representations of Likert

Results
We conducted a 3 x 2 x 2 ANOVA with sort of surprise, age

level of surprise as dependent variable.
    We found a main effect of social setting on the
