Each white marble that was not placed into the urn represents
$1 in prize money, which is only awarded if the marble that
the participant pulls from the urn turns out to be white.
    Four different conditions were tested which varied the
number of black marbles that were first placed in the urn: 1, 2,
8, or 25. In all conditions the participant was handed 10 white
marbles. If the participant were to put zero white marbles into
the urn, they have no chance of winning. On the other hand,
if they were to put all 10 white marbles into the urn, they win
nothing even if they draw a white marble. Thus, the experi-
mental design restricted participants to put anywhere between
1 and 9 white marbles into the urn. This number becomes our
primary dependent measure (i.e., “how many white marbles
do participants put into the urn as a function of the number of
black marbles in the urn?”).

comes out is white you will win the number of white marbles
that you chose not to put into the urn but rather set aside as
your potential prize money. This lottery will be performed
only once.”
   Next the experimenter held the urn in one hand and an
empty cup in the other hand and said the following:
   “Take your white marbles and decide how many you want
to put into the urn for the lottery and how many you want to
set aside in this cup as your potential prize money if you win
the lottery. Remember, each white marble is worth $1.”
   Once the participant divided up the white marbles between
the urn and the prize cup, the experimenter asked the partic-
ipant to confirm verbally what the monetary prize would be
if they pulled out a white marble from the urn to ensure that
there weren’t any misunderstandings.
   Next the experimenter held up the urn above the partici-
pant’s eyes and asked the participant to pull out a single mar-
ble from the urn. If the participant pulled out a black marble      Figure 2: Box and whiskers plot showing the results in all

outcomes of the lotteries are irrelevant to our study and so we
do not report them.
   Figure 2 shows a box and whiskers plot for the number of
white marbles put into the urn in each experimental condi-
tion. The colored asterisks mark the optimal number of white
marbles that should be put into the urn to maximize expected
gain in each condition. For each of the four conditions we
used a single-sample t-test with the null hypothesis set to the
optimal number of marbles for the given condition. The stars
indicate the level of significance (see Figure 2 caption).
   The number of white marbles that participants, on average,
tended to put into the urn increased systematically with an in-
crease in the number of black marbles in the urn. Furthermore
the results indicate that, on average, participants systemati-
cally put one more white marble into the urn than dictated by
the normative rule that maximizes expected gain (i.e., peo-
ple, on average, are sub-optimal with respect to the norma-
tive rule, preferring a $1 decrease to their potential prize in
exchange for an increase to their probability of winning the
lottery).                                                           Figure 3: Expected utility functions if we take into account

   Future studies could tease apart these two accounts of par-
ticipants’ behavior by keeping the objective probabilities of
the lotteries the same and simply scaling up the value of each
white marble. According to the probability distortion account
we should see no change in participants’ average behavior.
But according to the intrinsic utility of winning account we
should see participants’ average behavior shift toward opti-
mal as the intrinsic utility of winning is diluted relative to the
increased potential winnings that the lotteries afford.
