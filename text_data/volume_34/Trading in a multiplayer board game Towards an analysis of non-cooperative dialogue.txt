    Modifying JSettlers for Corpus Collection
To analyse trading dialogues and to perform inferences about
an agent’s underlying game strategy, one needs a corpus
where each utterance is aligned with a machine readable ver-
sion of its synchronous game state. To this end, we adapted
an existing open source implementation of Settlers, cf. Fig. 1
(JSettlers2, version 1.1.12). JSettlers mimics the physical ver-
sion of the game in that each player can see the whole board
but only his own hand (in a colour-coded panel). In JSettlers,
trades are done graphically via the interface, see Fig. 2a. The
player whose turn it is has two panels containing ‘I Give’,
‘I Get’ and colour coded buttons for the other players – he           a)                                  b)
