valence (positive or negative) of the emotion into account,
but only the standard magnitude of the corresponding class
of events (sometimes considered to result from social con-
sensus) (e.g. the death of child is supposed to be emotionally
more intense than the death of an adult person, all things be-
ing equal) (Jones, 1991; Bleske-Rechek et al. 2010).
   According to Simplicity Theory, the emotional intensity at-
tached to an event is the sum of the hypothetical emotional
intensity and of unexpectedness: E = Eh + U. Since U de-
pends on the complexity of the persons involved in the event
(with a minus sign), the definition of E reflects the fact that
one is more affected if the victim of an accident is a close ac-
