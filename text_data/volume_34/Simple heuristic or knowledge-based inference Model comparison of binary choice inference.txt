Abstract
We investigated the processes of making inference in binary
choice tasks. We proposed statistical models for two simple
heuristics and two knowledge-based inferences, and compared how well these models could explain the observed patterns of inferences. It was found that the best model for explaining choice patterns varied depending on the inference
problem. In particular, results suggested that participants used
a simple heuristic when they had difficulty in retrieving clues
pertaining to the inference problem. In contrast, when participants could retrieve enough clues pertaining to inference
problems, they made inferences based on these clues.

Introduction
In the last decade, a highly controversial topic in research on
judgment and decision-making has been the recognition
heuristic (Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002). When the recognition heuristic is applied to a binary choice problem, the
inference rule is described as follows:
“If one of two objects is recognized and the other
is not, then infer that the recognized object has
the higher value with respect to the criterion.”
(Goldstein and Gigerenzer, 2002, p.76)
For example, consider the following question, “Which city
has the larger population, Tokyo or Chiba?” In this problem,
the recognition heuristic predicts that when a person recognizes Tokyo but not Chiba, the person will infer that Tokyo
has the larger population.
Many researchers have discussed the recognition heuristic from theoretical, empirical, and rational perspectives. For
example, in the journal Judgment and Decision Making, a
special issue on the recognition heuristic was published in
2010 and 2011, which included 24 papers in three volumes.
In particular, researchers have been interested in whether
the recognition heuristic is actually used in making inferences. Some researchers have claimed that people often
make inferences based on the recognition heuristic in binary
choice situations, in which people recognize one of the objects in a pair1 (Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002; Pachur, Bröder, & Marewski, 2008; Pachur & Hertwig, 2006; Reimer &

Hereafter, depending on the recognition of objects in a pair, we
use following abbreviations: R-U (Recognized-Unrecognized), RR
(Recognized-Recognized),
and
U-U
(UnrecognizedUnrecognized).

katsikopoulos, 2004; Snook & Cullen, 2006; Volz et al.,
2006). In contrast, others have argued that although people
make inferences using the recognition heuristic in some R-U
pairs, people often make inferences using knowledge pertaining to the inference problem when such knowledge is
available (Bröder & Eichler 2006; Hilbig, Pohl, & Bröder,
2009; Glöckner & Bröder, 2011; Newell & Fernandez,
2006; Newell & Shanks, 2004; Oeusoonthornwattana &
Shanks, 2010; Oppenheimer, 2003; Pohl, 2006; Richter &
Späth, 2006).
The recognition heuristic can be applied only to R-U
pairs. Thus, although many studies have accumulated evidence for both the arguments, they have focused on the processing of inference in R-U pairs. Then, how do people
make inferences when they recognize both objects of the
pair? Previous studies have assumed that in the case of R-R
pairs, inferences are made by using knowledge (e.g., Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002; Hilbig, 2010). As described
above, many studies have suggested that when people have
knowledge in addition to mere recognition, inferences are
affected by the knowledge. However, specific models of
knowledge-based inferences have not been proposed to date.
Furthermore, people may make inferences using a simple heuristic such as the recognition heuristic, even in the
case of R-R pairs. For example, Hertwig, Herzog, Schooler,
and Reimer (2008) proposed a fluency heuristic, which is an
inference strategy using the retrieval fluency of objects, and
Honda, Abe, Matsuka, and Yamagishi (2011) proposed a
familiarity heuristic, which is the inference strategy using
the familiarity of objects.
The goal of the present study was to examine binary
choice inferences in not only R-U pairs, but also in R-R
pairs. Brighton and Gigerenzer (2009) argued that when
examining the validity of the recognition heuristic, alternative models should be proposed and compared. Accordingly,
we approached the above issue by comparing models. In
particular, we examined binary choice of population inferences, by comparing the validity of models representing a
simple heuristic and knowledge-based inference.

Models of binary choice inference
For each pair of cities, the two cities can be ordered by their
actual populations, and we name them accordingly. For example, if cities X and Y are presented, and the city X has a
larger population than city Y, we call city X the “larger
city,” and city Y the “smaller city.”

Simple heuristic
We examined inferences in not only R-U pairs, but also in
R-R pairs. Simple heuristics that can be applied to both R-U
and R-R pairs are appropriate for this purpose. Hence, we
used the fluency heuristic and the familiarity heuristic for
modeling simple heuristics.
Fluency heuristic. This model is based on Hertwig et al.
(2008). They have defined the model as follows: If two objects, a and b, are recognized, and one of the two is fluently
retrieved, then infer that this object has the higher value
with respect to the criterion (p. 1192). Based on this definition, the response pattern in pair i in the binary choice task
is represented by the following variable, Flui:

Flui =

FluSi ! FluLi
(1)
FluLi + FluSi

ZM i =

where FluLi and FluSi represent the fluency for the larger and
smaller cities in pair i. The range of this variable is
!1 < X Flu < 1 2. Given a pair in which participants were
more fluent with the smaller city, Flui took a value less than
0. In contrast, for a pair in which participants were more
fluent with the larger city, Flui took a value larger than 0. If
participants were equally fluent with the larger and smaller
cities, Flui approached 0.
Familiarity heuristic. This model is based on Honda et al.
(2011). It assumes that when there is a difference in familiarity between two cities, people will infer that the more familiar city has the larger population. Response patterns in
pair i in the binary choice task are assumed to be represented by the following variable, Fami:

Fami =

FamLi ! FamSi
(2)
FamLi + FamSi

where FamLi and FamSi represent the familiarity for the
larger and smaller cities in pair i. The range of this variable
is !1 " Fami " 1 3. Given a pair in which participants were
more familiar with the smaller city, Fami took a value less
than 0. In contrast, for a pair in which participants were
more familiar with the larger city, Fami took a value larger
than 0. If participants were equally familiar with the larger
and smaller cities, Fami approached 0.

Models: Knowledge-based inference
Some researchers have pointed out that people use available
knowledge in binary choice inferences. Although it might
be difficult to clarify the specific processes of knowledgebased inferences, previous findings have been straightforward: When people have knowledge pertaining to population size, that knowledge directly affects the inference processes. For example, when one knows that a city has a professional soccer team, implying a larger population, that city

elapsed time for city recognition. See the Resulats and Discussion.

We set the minimum values of FamLi and FamSi with zero. See
the Results and Discussion section.

is more likely to be picked in a binary choice. Contrarily,
when one knows that a city is rapidly aging, implying a declining population, it is unlikely to be chosen.
We assumed that people are clued to retrieve information when making inferences about the population of
cities, as to whether the cities are large, or small. Based on
this assumption, we modeled two knowledge-based inferences, a Z-score model and a Decision by Sampling model.
Z-score model (ZM). This model assumes that people have
correct knowledge of absolute population sizes of cities, and
that the availability of knowledge depends on their familiarity with cities. In each list, we calculated the z-scores for
15 cities (See Table 1). Using the z-scores, the response
pattern in pair i is represented by the following variable,
ZMi:

FamiLi zLi ! FamiSi zSi
(3)
! ( zmax ! zmin )

where zLi and zSi denote z-scores for the larger and smaller
cities in pair the i, and zmax and zmin denote maximum and
minimum z-scores in the list. In this equation, α is a positive
constant determining the range of this variable. The most
important feature of ZMi is that when people are familiar
with a small city (i.e., the city with a negative z-score), that
city is unlikely to be chosen. This feature differs from the
familiarity heuristic, which assumes that familiarity leads to
choice.
Decision by Sampling (DbS). As noted above, ZM assumes
that people have correct knowledge about population sizes.
However, this assumption may be inappropriate. Hilbig,
Pohl, and Bróder (2009) suggested that participants have
knowledge about the relative ranks of a criterion value within a given set. Thus, we have proposed another model of
knowledge-based inference, Decision by Sampling (DbS),
which was originally proposed by Stewart, Chater, and
Brown (2006).
In this model, the subjective value of an object is determined by relative rank. In the present study, we assumed
that knowledge about population sizes is determined by the
relative rank in the list. The rank of each city in the list is
calculated using following equation:

r=

R !1
! 0.5 (4)
14

where R is the rank of the population in a list in an ascending order (the specific value of r for each city is shown in
Table 1). The value, r, ranges from -0.5 to 0.5 depending on
population size. Using r, the response pattern in pair i is
represented by following variable, DbSi:

DbSi =

famLi rLi ! famSi rSi
(5)
!

where rLi and rSi denote r for the larger and smaller cities in
pair i, respectively. Value β is a positive constant determining the range of this variable. The feature of this variable is
analogous to ZMi. Thus, when people are familiar with a
small city, it is unlikely to be chosen in binary choice inferences.

Experiment
Method
Participants. Japanese undergraduates from Wako University, Keio University, and Toho University (n = 79; 26 men
and 53 women) participated in this experiment. They were
given course credits for participation.
Tasks and Materials. We conducted three tasks, a binary
choice task of population inference, measurement of familiarity, and a recognition task.
In the binary choice task, participants were presented
with two Japanese city names and were asked to choose the
city that they thought had the larger population.
In this task, we used Lists A and B (Table 1) that were
used in Honda et al. (2011). Honda et al. (2011) suggested
that these two lists differ in availability of knowledge pertaining to populations, and participants made inferences
using different strategies. Inference patterns for List A could
be well explained by the familiarity heuristic. In contrast,
patterns of population inference using List B could be well
explained by differences in the actual populations, indicating that participants had a good knowledge about the population sizes of cities on List B.
For the recognition test, participants were asked whether
they knew the 30 cities that were presented in the binary
choice task. For the measurement of familiarity, participants
were asked how well they knew the 30 cities presented in
the binary choice task.
Procedure. The three tasks were individually conducted
using a computer, and they were presented in the following
order: binary choice task, recognition task, and measurement of familiarity.
In the binary choice task, when participants pressed the
key named, “Next,” the focal point “*” was presented for
2000 ms on a computer screen. Then, two city names were

presented on the scree. Participants responded to the question by pressing one of two keys assigned to make a choice.
Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and correctly as possible. Half of the participants first received 105
(

15 !14
) pairs from List A, then 105 pairs from List B.

The other participants were presented the lists in the opposite order. The presentation order of the listed cities was
randomized.
In the recognition task, by pressing the key named,
“Next,” the focus point “*” was presented for 2000ms, then
a single city name was presented. Participants responded to
the question by pressing one of two keys named, “Recognized,” or “Unrecognized.” The time that elapsed between
the presentation of city name and the participants’ key-press
was recorded. Participants were instructed to respond as
quickly and correctly as possible.
For the measurement of familiarity, pressing the key
named, “Next,” presented the participants with a city name.
They were asked to rate their familiarity with the city using
a 100-point scale shown on the screen. The scale ranged
between (not know at all) on the far left to (know a lot) on
the far right.
The above three tasks took 45-60 minutes to complete.

Results and Discussion
In the following analysis, we operationally define familiarity with cities based on participants’ responses during the
measurement of the familiarity task. Unrecognized cities
were assigned a zero. Retrieval fluency for a city was operationally defined, based on the elapsed time recorded in the
recognition task, as in Hertwig et al. (2008). It was assumed
that the more quick the recognition response was, the more
fluent was a participant’s retrieval of an object.
The constant values, α and β, were set at 100. The range
of ZMi and DbSi are !1 < ZM i " 1 and !0.5 " DbSi " 1 .

Analysis of aggregated data
Similarity among models. Although the four models were
based on different assumptions about the processes of inference, predictions of binary choice might be analogous. Thus,
we analyzed the similarity among the four models.
For 105 pairs on Lists A and B respectively, we calculated Flui, Fami, ZMi, and DbSi using mean familiarity or
fluency for each city. Then we analyzed similarities among
the four models in terms of correlation.
Table 2 shows the correlation coefficients among the
variables. It was found that two heuristic models were analogous to each other. So were two knowledge-based inference models. Similarity between the heuristic and
knowledge-based inference models varied depending on the
list. With List A, heuristic models did not show a similarity
with knowledge-based inferences. However, heuristic models showed a moderate similarity with the knowledge-based
inference models in List B.
Predictions of choice patterns. Next, we examined the relationship between variables of the four models and choice
patterns. For choice patterns, we used proportion of correct
choice (i.e., rate of the larger city choice in a pair). For 105

pairs from Lists A and B respectively, we calculated the
proportion of correct choice, and then examined correlations
between the proportions and Flui, Fami, ZMi, and DbSi.
Figure 1 shows this relationship. As to the results of List
A (the upper four figures), the two heuristic models predicted the choice patterns better than the knowledge-based inference models. In particular, a strong relationship between
Fami and choice patterns was observed. Hence, these results
suggest that the familiarity heuristic explains inference processes in List A.
The results for List B showed a different picture. Of the
knowledge-based inference models, DbSi showed a stronger
relationship with the choice patterns than the others. Although Fami also showed a relationship with choice patterns
comparable with DbSi, DbS will be a more appropriate
model than the familiarity heuristic to explain choice patterns in List B. List B consists of well-known cities, and
therefore, it is quite likely that participants could retrieve
many clues pertaining to population size (Honda, et al.,
2011). As a result, participants could have knowledge about
population size such as relative rank, which is assumed in
DbS.

Taken together, it was found that choice patterns were
explained by different models depending on which list was
used. In List A, heuristic models explained choice patterns
better than knowledge-based inference models. In contrast,
in List B, where participants were predicted to easily access
many clues pertaining to the population size, choice patterns
were explained by knowledge-based inference models better
than heuristic models.

Analysis of individual data4
Similarity among models. As in the aggregated analysis, we
first analyzed the similarity of correlations among the four
models. We calculated correlation coefficients for each participant, and examined the distribution of the coefficients.
Table 3 provides medians of correlation coefficients for
the six pairs. In List A, results were analogous to those in
the aggregated data analysis. However, the observed similarities were much stronger than with the aggregated data
analysis. For List B, similarity between two knowledgebased inference models was observed as in the aggregated
data analysis. However, similarities were not observed between the fluency heuristic and familiarity heuristic. Moreover, similarity was not observed between the two heuristics
and two knowledge-based inferences.
Thus, we found that there was no similarity between the
two models at the individual level, even when it was observed with the aggregated data.
Predictions of choice patterns. Next, we examined choice
patterns using individual data. Specifically, we adopted a
model-based approach using a multilevel-logistic regression
analysis (Gelman & Hill, 2007). We compared the four
models that predicted the choice patterns in terms of model
fitting.
The four models, fluency heuristic, familiarity heuristic,
ZM, and DbS are represented as follows:

In the following analyses, we excluded U-U pairs.

DbS

= aFlui + b (6)

= aZM i + b (8)
= aDbSi + b (9)

where PCLi denotes the choice rate for the larger city in pair i.
Values a and b denote free parameters for weight and intercept, respectively. For Lists A and B, these four models
were regressed, based on individual data from 79 participants. Then we assessed the goodness of fit of the models
using log-likelihood values. Table 3 shows the result of this
analysis. For List A, the familiarity heuristic resulted in the
best fit among the four models. For List B, DbS was a better
fit than the other models.
Hence, findings based on individual data were analogous
to those based on aggregated data. It was found that participants changed their inference strategies, depending on the
list. Choice patterns with List A were well explained by the
familiarity heuristic, and those with List B were well explained by DbS.

General Discussion
In the present study, we examined the processes of inference
regarding binary choices by model comparisons. We proposed statistical models for simple heuristic and knowledgebased inferences. It was found that the familiarity heuristic
well explained the inference patterns for List A, and that
DbS well explained those for List B. These findings suggest
that people use different strategies depending on the situation.
The most important difference between Lists A and B is
how easily people can retrieve clues relevant to population
size. Given that List B consisted of well-known cities (Hon-

1695

da et al., 2011), participants could easily retrieve clues pertaining to population size. For larger cities, participants
could retrieve many clues suggesting that the population
size would be large. Similarly, participants could retrieve
many clues suggesting smaller population sizes for small
cities. As a result, inference patterns could be well explained
by knowledge-based inference models. Note that DbS explained the inference patterns better than ZM. This finding
suggests that participants could have a good sense of population size in relative level. This is consistent with the findings of Hilbig, Pohl, and Bröder (2009).
On the other hand, participants might not have retrieved
clues relevant to population size, and then used a simple
inference strategy, such as the familiarity heuristic. In other
words, a simple heuristic is the likely strategy when people
have difficulty in retrieving clues relevant to inferences.
This finding is consistent with the framework for understanding heuristics proposed by Shah and Oppenheimer
(2008).
