    "## Changing meaning of \"network\"\n",
    "There are two major meanings of network in the history of cognitive science: first is as a cognitive modelling method, second is in the biological neural network. By separating the terms with increased or decreased weights in this topic over year, these two meanings and their change of popularity emerges:\n",
    "![rising trend of biological neural network](figures/network_topic/increase_terms.png)\n",
    "![falling trend of artificial neural network models](figures/network_topic/decrease_terms.png)\n",
    "We can also see this separation from the titles of most typical papers of this topic (i.e. papers with the highest weight on this topic).\n",

    "## rise of probabilistic topic\n",
    "### 1. rising trend\n",
    "![an apparent rising trend of probabilistic modeling topic](figures/topics.png)\n",
    "One of the most noticable trend is the rise of probabilistic modeling topic over recent years. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. the field of cogsci is becoming probabilistic?\n",
    "When we ask what contributes to this rising popularity, there are two possibilities: either more papers are dedicated to this topic specifically, or papers across different fields are all becoming a bit more probabilistic, i.e. their language becoming more similar to the prototyped probabilistic topics. If the latter is true, we would expect the term distribution over all papers becoming more similar to the distribution of this specific topic; if the former is true, we won't see this change of term composition. Mathematically, we can measure the similarity between term distributions by their KL divergence. \n",
    "Turns out: sort of decreasing....but not that clear...maybe should have compared with other topics\n",
